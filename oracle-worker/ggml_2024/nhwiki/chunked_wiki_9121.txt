** a [[Samurai]] firing [[ya]] from a [[yumi]]
** a [[Rogue]] throwing [[dagger]]s (of any variety)
** a [[Ranger]] with any missile weapon
* 33% of +1 if you are firing with a non-cursed [[elven bow]]
* 33% of +1 if you are firing non-cursed [[elven arrow]]s
* {{frac|3}} of enchantment of launcher (bow, crossbow, sling), rounded to the nearest integer, thus:
** +0 for +0 or +1 launcher
** +1 for +2 to +4 launcher
** +2 for +5 to +7 launcher
** +3 for +8 to +10 launcher, etc.
* reduced to 1 if you are [[Confusion|confused]], [[stun]]ned, or the missile requires a [[launcher]] which you aren't wielding

Given that [[elf|elven]] [[Ranger]]s start out with a +2 [[elven bow]] and [[elven arrow]]s, an elven ranger will shoot d6 arrows {{frac|9}} of the time, d5 arrows {{frac|4|9}} of the time, and d4 arrows {{frac|4|9}} of the time, for an average of just below 3 arrows per turn, making them a potent choice in SLASH'EM's challenging early game. There is no multishot bonus for [[drow]] firing [[dark elven arrow]]s from a [[dark elven bow]].

Finally, [[firearm]]s in SLASH'EM are a special case with a complex rate of fire calculation based on type of firearm and skill level of the user.

===UnNetHack===
UnNetHack grants +1 to the multishot counter when firing [[arrows]] from [[the Longbow of Diana]].

===FIQHack===
FIQHack grants +1 to the multishot counter when firing arrows from the Longbow of Diana.

===Fourk===
Cavemen get +1 multishot with a sling, and can find slingable silver nuggets on their quest. Silver ammunition of any kind has reduced multishot potential.

===Splicehack===
Also grants +1 to the multishot counter when firing arrows from the Longbow of Diana.

&&%s&& %s Automatic searching {141424 2021-07-02T19:26:59Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''Automatic searching''' is a useful [[property]] that causes you to automatically [[search]] every square around you at the end of every game [[turn]].

This works just like the search command, except that you will not find hidden/invisible monsters, and you will not search by touch if you are [[blind]].

This saves you needing to manually use {{kbd|s}} to search nearby squares all the time, and is free â€“ it does not cost extra time. Thus, you stand a much better chance of finding [[trap]]s just before you stumble into them, and can also locate [[portal]]s and [[hidden door]]s much more easily. (On the minus side, it could also cause you to find secret doors when, due to not wanting to deal with a known monster behind them, you would prefer they remain hidden. Similarly, it could reveal [[mimic]]s or [[statue trap]]s when you would rather let them lie.)

Automatic searching may be acquired as an [[intrinsic]] if you start out as a [[ranger]], at level 9 as a [[monk]], or at level 10 as an [[archaeologist]], [[rogue]], or [[tourist]].  Intrinsic automatic searching can also be gained if you succeed in [[eating jewelry|digesting]] a [[ring of searching]]. Wearing the ring will give you automatic searching as an [[extrinsic]], which costs you [[nutrition]] because you are wearing a ring, and prevents you from wearing other rings on that hand. Wielding [[Excalibur]] also grants this extrinsic, without the normal [[ring hunger]].

In [[SLASH'EM]], the [[Yeoman quest]] contains a tower based on the real-life Tower of London, and The Tower of the Dark Lord acts as the home level of the [[Necromancer quest]].

In the [[SLethe]] patch, additional towers are added to the [[Castle]].

{{encyclopedia|
Towers (_brooding_, _dark_) stand alone in Waste Areas and
almost always belong to Wizards.  All are several stories high,
round, doorless, virtually windowless, and composed of smooth
blocks of masonry that make them very hard to climb. [...]
You will have to go to a Tower and then break into it at some
point towards the end of your Tour.

The [http://nethack.devnull.net/tournament/trophies.shtml trophy description] states, "harkening back to Zork, players accepting this Challenge must find and figure out how to use the Frobozz Company Inter-Dimensional Portal Generator before being eaten by a Grue".

==Description==
The challenge places a [[magic portal]] at the bottom of the Gnomish Mines that goes to the darkened [[Grue Lair]] - a big, empty room with no monsters generated inside on creation, and causes [[instadeath]] if the player attempts to do anything in an unlit area. Said death is not without warning - the first time, the player will be greeted with the iconic ''Zork'' message:

{{message|It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.}}

If the message is printed three times and the player character is not in a lit square, they are instantly killed with the message "Eaten by a Grue". Multi-step movement commands do not count entering darkness or the message appearing as cause to interrupt those commands by default - furthermore, a bug in the code prints this message and updates the counter for every action taken, rather than ones that take in-game [[turn]]s. As such, it is possible to get eaten without any time passing, e.g. when checking your inventory for a light source.

To win the challenge, players must find a "sinister device" within the lair, [[identify]] it, and [[apply]] it while avoiding being caught by the titular grue. Once identified, the device is referred to as the "Frobozz Company Inter-Dimensional Portal Generator (TM)", and applying it will allow you to escape the room successfully. Applying the device after the challenge has been won will have no effect beyond printing this message: "On the other hand, maybe you should leave that portal closed ...."

The name comes from [[Dungeons & Dragons]].  In [[NetHack]]'s punnish fashion, some forms of undead turning can also turn dead things "un-dead" (alive): see the [[revive]] article for more details.

"Turn undead" or "undead turning" in NetHack may refer to several concepts:

* the [[turn undead|#turn]] [[extended command]], which scares, destroys, or pacifies nearby undead.  Does not revive corpses and eggs.
* the [[spellbook of turn undead]], a beam spell that scares undead and revives corpses and eggs
* the [[wand of undead turning]], the wand equivalent of the spell
* reading the cursed [[Book of the Dead]], which will revive nearby corpses and eggs, along with summoning some undead monsters

The '''spellbook of enchant weapon''' does not exist in [[vanilla]] NetHack, but can be found in [[SLASH'EM]] and also in [[NetHack Plus]] and [[SlashTHEM]].

The spellbook allows you to learn the enchant weapon spell. The spell is a level 7 Enchantment spell. Casting the spell has a chance based on skill level of acting as an uncursed [[scroll of enchant weapon]]. The chances of success are 1 in 8 at Expert, 1 in 10 at Skilled, 1 in 12 at Basic, and 1 in 14 at Unskilled or Restricted.

==Strategy==
This spell has too high a level, and too high a failure rate even when cast successfully, to be useful for most characters.  Non-[[wizard]]s will find the [[spell hunger]] to be fairly costly, not to mention the time spent recovering their [[power]].  Moreover, the spell cannot give the effect of a blessed scroll.

Only [[wizard]]s might consider using the spell to save themselves a few charges on their [[magic marker]]s. And since wizards rely on spells instead of weapons, the real advantage is even smaller.

However, this spell, is probably useful for players attempting [[conduct]]s.

''This article is about the artifact weapon in the Pirate patch. For the role title, see [[Barbarian]].''

'''Reaver''' is an artifact cutlass ([[scimitar]]) in the [[Pirate]] patch for NetHack. It is the [[crowning]] gift for Pirates, and is the only artifact weapon they are able to receive from their deity (or guaranteed artifact weapon of any kind in the game). 

Reaver adds +1d4 to hit and +1d8 to damage, which combined with its relatively weak base damage of 1d8, makes it noticeably weaker than other artifact swords such as [[Excalibur]], [[Stormbringer]], and [[Snickersnee]], not to mention [[Grayswandir]], or the [[Fire and Frost Brand|the Brands]]. However, it steals one item from an opponent with each successful hit, which will allow the Pirate to collect [[potion of full healing|potions of full healing]], [[amulet of life saving|amulets of life saving]], and attack [[wand]]s that otherwise would have been used up by monsters.

If the player has no room for a stolen object, it will be dropped at the player's feet ("Ye snatched but dropped <object>"). Note that stealing a [[footrice]] corpse from an opponent while not wearing [[gloves]] can lead to a [[petrification]] [[instakill]].

The Pirate [[Crowning#Title|crowning title]] is '''"Pirate King"'''. This is partly a reference to the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance''.

{{encyclopedia|
Oh, better far to live and die
Under the brave black flag I fly,
Than play a sanctimonious part,
With a pirate head and a pirate heart.
Away to the cheating world go you,
Where pirates all are well-to-do;
But I'll be true to the song I sing,
And live and die a Pirate King.

For I am a Pirate King!
And it is, it is a glorious thing
To be a Pirate King!

When I sally forth to seek my prey
I help myself in a royal way.
I sink a few more ships, it's true,
Than a well-bred monarch ought to do;
But many a king on a first-class throne,
If he wants to call his crown his own,
Must manage somehow to get through
More dirty work than ever I do,

For I am a Pirate King!
And it is, it is a glorious thing
To be a Pirate King!

'''rnl(<var>x</var>)'''{{refsrc|src/rnd.c|116|nethack=3.6.6|name=main}} is a pseudo-random number function used in ''NetHack'' when a result should be weighted by [[Luck]].

rnl(<var>x</var>) has the same range as rn2(<var>x</var>) (that is, 0&nbsp;&le; rnl(<var>x</var>)&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var>x</var>), but is weighted toward 0 if you have positive Luck, and toward <var>x</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 if you have negative Luck.

== Formula ==

See source code in <ref name=main/>

For rnl(<var>x</var>), let <var>L</var> equal your Luck, including the [[luck item]] bonus or penalty, whether positive, negative, or zero.

If <var>x</var> &le; 15, <var>L</var> = {{frac|<var>L</var>|3}}, rounded toward the nearest integer.

If <var>L</var> = 0, return [[rn2]](<var>x</var>).

With chance {{sfrac|1|37 + {{!}}<var>L</var>{{!}}}}, return rn2(<var>x</var>).

Otherwise, return rn2(<var>x</var>) - <var>L</var>, but no less than 0 and no more than <var>x</var> - 1.

This means that rnl(<var>x</var>) is almost always equivalent to rn2(<var>x</var>) - Luck when <var>x</var> > 15. The chance of Luck being ignored is less than 3% in any case, and even smaller for stronger (positive or negative) Luck. For smaller values of <var>x</var>, rn2(<var>x</var>) - {{sfrac|Luck|3}} is the most likely approximation.

== How it's used ==

In the tables below, some very high (99.8%) and very low (0.2%) values above are rounded to 100% or 0%. Nothing is completely 100% or 0% likely, except where spelled out as "certain" or "impossible".

== Mathematical analysis ==

Basically, rnl(<var>x</var>) generates a number between 0 and <var>x</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, and adjusts it in proportion to the player's Luck, with a small chance (which is smaller when Luck tends toward the extremes) of leaving it alone. The net effect is that with positive or negative Luck, the highest or lowest numbers on the list become vanishingly unlikely, and the odds of getting the best and worst result increase, while the odds of getting every result in between stays the same.

Further complicating the matter is that, when <var>x</var> is 15 or less, the adjustment is divided by 3, which means that for those calls there is a stepwise distribution where the odds of everything are almost completely the same within blocks of 3 numbers (&minus;13 to &minus;11, &minus;10 to &minus;8, &minus;7 to &minus;5, &minus;4 to &minus;2, &minus;1 to 1, 2 to 4, 5 to 7, 8 to 10, 11 to 13). Larger parameters have smoother distributions.

In addition, the function often being called in unusual manners, such as comparing it to a non-zero constant, which results in a "slice" being taken from the distribution graph at a less easily explainable point.  This is evidenced in the distrubtions for rnl(A)&lt;B or rnl(A)&gt;B above.

Since many of the comparisons are made against 0, having even &minus;2 Luck can cause many results to swing against the player's favor with near certainty. &minus;1 Luck is not as bad as most of these calls also have a small parameter, although it does negatively affect many things that do not call rnl (like [[prayer]] or [[wish]]ing). On the flip side, positive Luck's effect tends to be much less dramatic, and +2 Luck still has a lot of room for improvement. +1 Luck changes almost nothing significantly; the only pronounced effect it has is to cause jousting to be much safer.

== Sample distribution ==

This table is the computed odds of rnl(10) at each possible Luck for each possible result. The "0%" values are actually around 0.24â€“0.26% depending on the magnitude of the Luck.

== History ==

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], the formulas were slightly different.<ref>[https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source:NetHack_3.4.3/src/rnd.c#rnl rnl in rnd.c for Nethack 3.4.3]</ref>

Let <var>R</var> be a random integer number from 0 to <var>x</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 (inclusive).

If Luck&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, <var>R</var> is returned.

Otherwise, with {{sfrac|1|50 &minus; Luck}} chance (since Luck ranges from &minus;13 to 13, the chance should be between {{sfrac|37}} and {{sfrac|63}}), <var>R</var> is returned.

Otherwise, if <var>x</var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp; 15 and Luck&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&minus;5 (that is, <var>x</var> is not too big and the player is not too unlucky), {{sfrac|Luck|3}} (truncated towards zero) is subtracted from <var>R</var>, then <var>R</var> is forced into the interval [0, <var>x</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1] and returned.

Otherwise, Luck is subtracted from <var>R</var>, then <var>R</var> is forced into the interval [0, <var>x</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1] and returned.

'''Grenades''' are a new type of weapon in [[SLASH'EM]]. There are two specific types, the '''frag grenade''' and the '''gas grenade'''. Both are found on soldiers of various ranks; for specifics, see [[firearm]].

==Damage==
Frag grenades do 3d6 [[fire]] damage that can degrade organic [[armor]] and destroy [[scroll]]s and [[potion]]s, while gas grenades do 3d6 poison damage to any monsters that are not [[poison resistance|poison resistant]]. The explosion of a grenade on its own will create a blast radius, a 3 x 3 square (the same form as a [[fireball]]) centered on the grenade's landing point. Multiple grenades exploding on the same square may produce a larger blast radius. Also note that exploding grenades will destroy [[bullet]]s lying on the ground. If an armed grenade explodes in your inventory, you'll take damage despite any resistances you may have.

==Arming==
Grenades will become armed when they are thrown or [[Apply|applied]]. Note that applying a stack of grenades in your inventory will arm the entire stack. A grenade will explode one to six turns after having being armed, depending on its BUC status:
*Blessed: 4 turns
*Uncursed: ''d2''+2 turns
*Cursed: ''d5''+1 turns
[[Cursed]] grenades additionally have a chance of not arming at all. The first turn in the above counts includes the turn taken arming the grenade. Note that the better the BUC status of the grenade, the more reliable its fuse length. Armed grenades can be kicked or picked up and [[throw]]n at other targets. The impact of a grenade always does 1-2 points of damage before the explosion.

==Strategy==
Grenades are not generally very useful weapons. They are heavy, and as compared to other [[firearm]]s, they do comparatively little damage. A [[grenade launcher]] does little to ameliorate this situation, and is little better than throwing them. As a threat to the player, they are rendered harmless by fire resistance and poison resistance, both of which one is reasonably likely to have before meeting soldiers. Their main danger is that they can burn armor, and they destroy bullets on the ground. The latter can be a serious impediment to building up a large collection of bullets, so one should try to gather bullets quickly, and toss away any grenades that are thrown near them.
Grenades are also useful to sell to shopkeepers, since they are relatively valuable and appear in good-sized stacks.
Another way to deal with armed grenades is to put them into a container that is otherwise empty, such as a sack. You will hear a muffled explosion, but there will be no other effect.

==Other things about grenades==
Throwing a grenade into water, then seeing it explode causes the message: "You see a plume of water shoot up".
If by some way you are fast enough to arm a grenade, drop it in a pit and fill the pit with a boulder, you will "hear a muffled explosion". This message is also shown when a frag grenade explodes in a container.

&&%s&& %s ZAPM {146970 2022-07-23T15:09:07Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''ZAPM''' is a sci-fi [[roguelike]] game by Cyrus Dolph. From the [http://zapm.org homepage]:
:''"It's my humble attempt to create "the sci-fi NetHack". It is very much a work in progress."''

ZAPM is not a true variant of NetHack, but it had importance in the 2008 [[:/dev/null/nethack tournament]]. The latest unstable version 0.8.2 was released 2010-06-06. The source code of version 0.6.3, 0.8.2, and 0.8.3 can be downloaded [https://github.com/winny-/ZAPM-mirror here] from an unofficial GitHub mirror. A continuation of ZAPM named PRIME has been started in March 2011.

The aim of ZAPM is to explore a derelict space hulk in search of the fabled "Bizarro Orgasmatron", rumored to be the most powerful
artifact in the galaxy and the only hope of saving the universe from an unknown doom.

==Differences and similarities==
Being roguelike, ZAPM has some things that are familiar, some that are different:
{| class="prettytable"
!NetHack !! ZAPM
|-
|[[Scroll]]s||Floppy disks - requires a computer to "run", can sometimes be reused
|-
|[[Potion]]s||Canisters don't have effects when thrown at monsters
|-
|[[Ring]]s||You may have up to five bionic implants installed in your brain
|-
|[[Wand]]s||Ray guns are not tied to particular energy ray type but can be reloaded with something else when empty
|-
|[[Launcher]]s||Guns of many descriptions, bearing distant similarity to [[SLASH'EM]]'s [[firearm]]s
|-
|[[Projectile]]s||Gun ammunition and grenades which need to be identified
|-
|[[Shirt]]s||Jumpsuits usually have single [[AC]] point and may give resistances
|-
|[[Suit]]s||Various body armor pieces like flak jackets and stormtrooper suits
|-
|[[Dragon scale mail|Dragon Suit]]s||Marine power armor are somewhat similar because being self-powered they do not encumber the character; no special resistances granted though
|-
|[[Helm]]s||Some headgear pieces may grant air filtering - an extrinsic unique to helms
|-
|[[Boot]]s, [[Gloves]], [[Cloak]]s, [[Shield]]s||Not present
|-
|no equivalent||Belts (actually just one type is implemented)
|-
|[[Lenses]], [[Blindfold]]||Blindfold is available but instead of lenses there are several types of goggles
|-
|[[Tool]]s||Equivalently broad category; its items quite similar in use to NetHacks
|-
|[[Door]]s||Automatic opening doors, locked doors with key cards of several colors, faulty doors that slam on the player
|-
|[[Sink]]s||Sludge vats
|-
|[[Trap]]s||Only (acid/sewage) pits, holes and radiation traps
|-
|[[Spellcasting]]||Mutant powers - cost temporary Charisma rather than Pw
|-
|Monsters of almost all [[ASCII]] letters||Monsters of many letters of alphabet. Some are yet unused
|-
|Corpses||Only droids and bots leave disabled versions once dead, unable to be eaten
|}

There are no [[race]]s and [[role]]s, only professions.

ZAPM is a refreshing jaunt with plenty of differences to vanilla and is quite enjoyable.

==Classes==
ZAPM has five playable classes: Psion, Quarterback, Space Marine, Software Engineer and Janitor.

=== Psion ===
Psions are mutants, using their supercharged DNA to survive the hostile space hulk. They are guaranteed to start with at least 14 Charisma.

Starting equipment:
* debugged +1 laser pistol
* debugged +1 ordinary jumpsuit
* debugged pair of sunglasses
* 200 energy cells
* 2 debugged canisters of Nano Cola
* 1 debugged canister of healing
* 1 debugged canister of Rad-Away
* 2d10 buckazoids

Skills:
* Restricted: Programming
* Improvable by 1 point every 4 levels: Thrown Weapons, Light Guns, Heavy Guns, Unarmed Combat, Basic Melee Weapons, Pick Locks, Repair
* Improvable by 2 points every 4 levels: Handguns, Spot
* Improvable by 3 points every 4 levels: Search
* Improvable by 4 points every 4 levels: all Mutant Powers, Swords, Concentration

Starting skills:
* First random mutant power - 2
* Second random mutant power - 2

Common opening strategy is to drink from sludge vats hoping for more mutant powers. This is especially important if the Psion starts with utility mutant abilities.

=== Quarterback ===
Quarterbacks are strong athletes, looking to take on a new challenge but with the physical strength to survive - hopefully.

Starting equipment:
* debugged +0 set of football pads
* debugged +0 football helmet
* debugged +3 football
* 200 energy cells
* 6 debugged canisters of beer

Skills:
* Restricted: all Mutant Powers, Pick Locks, Repair, Programming
* Improvable by 1 point every 4 levels: none
* Improvable by 2 points every 4 levels: Light Guns, Heavy Guns, Swords, Concentration, Search
* Improvable by 3 points every 4 levels: Basic Melee Weapons
* Improvable by 4 points every 4 levels: Thrown Weapons, Unarmed Combat, Spot

Starting skills:
* Thrown weapons - 2
* Spot - 2

Since the quarterback starts without a gun he should destroy fuel barrels by throwing the football. When space goblins with pea shooters appear it is wise to let them shoot a few times at you to see if their weapon is buggy.

=== Space Marine ===
Space Marines are well-equipped "badasses" that fight aliens for a living. A space hulk may not be too much of a challenge. They are guaranteed to start with at least 10 Strength.

Starting equipment:
* debugged +1 flak jacket
* debugged +0 pistol
* debugged +0 pulse rifle (set to burst mode)
* 99 bullets
* 100 energy cells
* debugged motion tracker
* 2d10 buckazoids

Skills:
* Restricted: all Mutant Powers, Concentration, Programming
* Improvable by 1 point every 4 levels: Swords
* Improvable by 2 points every 4 levels: Pick Locks, Repair, Search, Spot
* Improvable by 3 points every 4 levels: Thrown Weapons, Unarmed Combat, Basic Melee Weapons
* Improvable by 4 points every 4 levels: Handguns, Light Guns, Heavy Guns

Starting skills:
* Thrown weapons - 2
* Handguns - 2
* Light Weapons - 2
* Heavy Weapons - 2

Marines have easy start. It is prudent to immediately switch the rifle to single fire by applying it. Weak creatures may be bashed with butt of the rifle since marines usually have very good strength.

=== Software engineer ===
Software engineers are physically weak but computer whizzes. They inherently know the ZAPM equivalent of [[BUC]] of items and can use technical items from the beginning of the game. They also do not suffer penalties for trying to write unidentified program.

Starting equipment:
* debugged +0 pea shooter
* debugged +0 ordinary jumpsuit
* debugged mini computer
* 4 random floppy disks
* 1 or 2 debugged canisters of Nano Cola
* 1 or 2 debugged rolls of duct tape
* debugged restaining bolt
* 200 energy cells
* 2d100 buckazoids

Skills:
* Restricted: all Mutant Powers, Unarmed Combat
* Improvable by 1 point every 4 levels: Light Weapons, Heavy Weapons, Basic Melee Weapons, Swords
* Improvable by 2 points every 4 levels: Thrown Weapons, Concentration, Spot
* Improvable by 3 points every 4 levels: Handguns, Programming
* Improvable by 4 points every 4 levels: Pick Locks, Search, Repair

Starting skills:
* Programming - 2

Painfully weak at the beginning the Software Engineer should make use of his sense bugginess innate ability to wear whatever he can as early as possible. Later on he is in perfect position to crack many floppy disks and have unlimited enhancements, identification, teleportation and many other utility powers. One should use the restraining bolt to force an early bot into service and repair it with duct tape whenever the need arises.

=== Janitor ===
Janitors start with a mop and a master keycard allowing them to bypass almost any door. By striking the "I'm just cleaning here" pose a janitor can get into Robot Town without a fee.

Starting equipment:
* debugged +1 mop
* debugged +1 janitor uniform
* debugged canister of super glue
* optimized monkey wrench
* debugged master keycard
* debugged restraining bolt
* 75 energy cells
* 1d100 buckazoids

Skills:
* Restricted: all Mutant Powers, Programming
* Improvable by 1 point every 4 levels: Thrown Weapons, Light Guns, Heavy Guns, Swords
* Improvable by 2 points every 4 levels: Unarmed Combat, Concentration
* Improvable by 3 points every 4 levels: Basic Melee Weapons
* Improvable by 4 points every 4 levels: Pick Locks, Repair, Search, Spot

Starting skills:
* Repair - 2
* Search - 2
* Spot - 2

Janitors often spot or find hidden niches generated in rooms which usually contain additional loot. In result have slightly more objects to choose from when assembling equipment. Janitors can hide from any monster behind a door by locking it with the master keycard. So far no monster can deal with locked doors.

=== Profession titles ===
Each class advancing in levels has appropriate [[rank]] titles.

{| class="prettytable"

|}

Reaching level 30 or higher results in segmentation fault but it is only possible to do so through use of debug mode.

== Attributes and basic character information==
ZAPM has the following [[attribute]]s as an indication of how developed a character is in certain areas:
{|class="prettytable"
!Attribute
!Importance
!Effect
|-
|Strength
|High
|Increases all melee damage and is the only determinant of carrying capacity. Determines thrown weapons range. Is drained by poison attacks and having it low to begin with increases chances of getting burdened or worse in combat. See [[#Restoring lost attribute points|the next section]] for a discussion on how to recover strength.
|-
|Constitution
|Medium
|Provides hit points modifier. At late levels it can be very substantial. Is drained during radiation sickness attacks making it imperative for surviving radiation exposure.
|-
|Agility
|High
|Besides affecting melee skills it modifies armor class (1 AC per 2 Agi) and speed (+5% speed per 2 Agi beyond 10). The last is very useful to have since at high values it allows to outrun aliens.
|-
|Dexterity
|Low
|Affects gun skills and once player character gains a few levels advantages of high dexterity are easily offset by skill points.
|-
|Intelligence
|Near zero
|Only affects two skills of which one is only accessible to software engineers and the other is made obsolete by spot and greater perseverance at searching for hidden doors.
|-
|Wisdom
|Near zero
|Affects only a single non-essential skill and, in a minuscule way, the chance of resisting enemy mutant power attacks. Nearly useless attribute.
|-
|Charisma
|Medium for psykers, low for others
|Replaces power points from NetHack. Since [[shopkeeper]]s are robots there is no haggling for prices with them, thus charisma does not influence [[shop]] prices in any way.
|-
|}

You get an increase to one of these every fourth experience level. In addition, there are properties of Experience (and a corresponding Experience Level and Title) Speed, Hit Points. Related and displayed as appropriate are also Energy, being the number of cells in your inventory, Buckazoids, being the currency of ZAPM, and if using a "traditional" projectile weapon, Ammo, being the number of bullets, shotgun shells or railgun slugs in your inventory.

Your locale and overall level is also displayed.

=== Restoring lost attribute points ===

If you've lost attribute points, don't panic.  You can restore them with one of the following remedies:

* Docbot's Restoration Treatment
* Zapping yourself with a restoration ray gun
* Quaffing a canister of restoration

Alternately, you may try gaining additional attribute points.  Try one of the following:

* Quaff a canister of gain ability
* Gain levels (tribble farming, smacking monoliths, or plain old combat).  You gain ability points on every fourth experience level.
* Some implants can affect attribute points
* ''Risky:'' quaff from a vat for the possible gain ability effect

== Skills ==
ZAPM has skills for a variety of aspects of gameplay. Each time the character gains a level, some skills can be increased. Psions, Janitors and Software Engineers receive three points to distribute while Space Marines and Quarterbacks get only two. Skills can be increased at varying paces, and certain skills are restricted for some classes. Each Skill is governed by a main Ability, determining the overall effectiveness of the Skill.

Skills fall in to three main groups: Combat Skills, Adventuring Skills and Mutant Power Skills.
