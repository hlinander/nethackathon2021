Note that "Inspire Courage" does not mimic an existing [[enchantment spell]]; however, the character still needs to know a specific spell (cause fear) in order to use it.

In the patch, Monks and Priests can advance the Musicalize Spell skill to Basic, while Tourists can advance it to Skilled.

In [[SlashTHEM]], [[Musician]]s and [[Rocker]]s can also reach Expert in Music.  In this variant, characters can perform any song without having to know the corresponding spell.

===Success chance in [[dNetHack]]===
Success chance is calculated as:

ATTRIBUTE x 2 x MUSICALITY_SKILL + experience level

Where:

* ATTRIBUTE is strength for drums (either leather or of earthquake) and dexterity for all other instruments.
* MUSICALITY_SKILL is 1 at unskilled, 2 at basic, etc.

Bonuses are applied (in the following order):
* If the instrument is an artifact '''or''' the instrument is the song's preferred type, increase the chance by 50%.
* If your health is lower than 30% of your maximum, increase the chance by 100%.
* If the instrument is a drum or a harp, and you are wearing a shield, decrease the chance by 50%.
* If you are blind, increase the chance by your experience level.
* If you are using the Lyre of Orpheus (Bard's quest artifact) and you are '''not''' playing one of: Rally, Meditative Healing, Lullaby, or Friendship, decrease the chance by 50%.

Note: The chance is only capped to 0/100% after all bonuses have been applied, so you can still get to 100% success chance with the Lyre of Orpheus.

==Techniques==
In SlashTHEM, the Bard gains [[technique]]s at the following [[experience level]]s:

* XL 1: [[Primal roar]] 
* XL 10: Booze 
* XL 20: [[Rage eruption]]

The Booze technique allows the Bard to simulate the effects of drinking [[booze]] without needing the potion ("You procure some refreshing drinks.")  This provides some [[nutrition]].

*SlashTHEM tech.c line 148

==Strategy==

===dNethack===

====Early game====

Early game is all about training up your musicalize skill by spamming it as much as possible, with the ultimate goal of getting Musicalize up to expert as quickly as possible. Use Lullaby on every enemy your pet fight to limit damage to your pet, and heal your pet with Meditative Healing as much as possible. As you begin to progress deeper in to the dungeon and find slightly stronger monsters, consider using Lethargy and Friendship to slow them down and capture them. Keep your eyes peeled for a magic whistle as this is essential to keeping your pets in position as you travel through the dungeon. When possible, upgrade your Beast Mastery skill to maximize your pets' effectiveness.

Exercise your dexterity as much as possible in the early game to build up this trait. As increased dexterity decreases the chance of failure from your Musicalize skills, most importantly the Friendship spell, you will need this trait at maximum as quickly as possible.

====Mid game====

As you progress through the mid game, keep a look out for an altar you can sacrifice on (or convert) and try to get your hands on the [[DNetHack_artifacts#The Singing Sword|Singing Sword]], which is essential for the mid game. Rushing the castle so you can get a few wishes, if you haven't received any already, is a good idea - that will allow you to take your time on the other quests once you're better equipped.

As you get stronger in the mid game, you should be constantly recruiting the most dangerous monsters you can find as pets, and you may have to lure strong monsters into isolation from other nearby monsters to capture them as nearby monsters may interrupt your musical spellcasting. During the Gnomish Mines, the Minetown Watch can serve you well, and Cerebus in Vlad's Tower will carry you for a quite a while. Mind flayers, dragons, orc kings, and even a few elementals are all good pets in this part of the game. The master mind flayer on throne at the start of the Neutral Quest is particularly good if you can get him - just make sure to surround yourself with enough disposable pets that you won't get hit with every attack. Metroids will also work well mid game, but as they level, they will eventually turn into an untamable metroid queen, so this is not a viable long-term option. 

The mid game is a good time to consider using scrolls of genocides to exterminate monsters that will instakill your pets. Purple worms, trappers, and cockatrices should all be eliminated if you're not going to use them yourself.

Keep an eye peeled for smart situational branches that could help you in creative ways. For example, if the Sunless Sea is the sunken city variant, you can recruit a few deep ones and then kill the constantly spawning hoarde of deep ones to create massively overpowered deepest ones that will help you tremendously in the mid and late game.

====Late game====

In general, as you progress deeper towards the late game, more and more monsters will shout down your Musicalize spells, making it difficult to heal monsters or recruit new monsters. All but the strongest of monsters should be considered disposable, and you should be constantly using your pets to protect you with their lives. When you actually complete your own quest, make sure to ring the Bell of Opening once to teach it to your Singing Sword - the five percent change of instantly killing monsters will be essential for killing demon princes and other strong monsters.

Demon princes in Gehennom will be a problem, and should be avoided as much as possible. Archons and other strong pets (like Lady Oona or Tulani Eladrim) that have lasted you well will not survive demon princes in a toe-to-toe fight. If you have to fight, ward a square, as a scared demon prince often won't attack either you or your pets. Good monsters to keep an eye out for include master mind flayers, orcs of the ages of the stars, Angband orcs, and ancient nagas. Ancient nagas particularly can be useful in Nessus, as these can kill Nessian pit fields quickly without triggering their summon nasties spell, though they may turn on you. Be careful in capturing pets that might turn traitor, but don't be afraid to include a few in your entourage - traitors will distribute their attacks against other pets as well as yourself, at which point you can just heal your pets with Meditative Healing.

Most likely, your stable troops will be a supply of dragons. Higher level dragons can take quite a lot of punishment, and the period summon nasties spell that starts to trigger after you've slain the Wizard will provide you with a ready supply. Keep your eyes peeled for summoned jabberwockies as well - these are somewhat fragile, but can dish out a lot of punishment and compliment a corps of dragons nicely.

In Moloch's Sanctum, avoid fighting the elder priest - you can wait for the Wizard of Yendor to spawn and then steal the amulet from him. Just make sure you have enough [[wand of death]] charges to kill him quickly as you make your final escape.

==Rank titles==
The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified [[experience level]]:

==Quest==
{{main|Bard_quest}}

The Bard quest sees the Bard traveling to the island of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthemoessa Anthemoessa] to fight the siren Aglaope for the Lyre of Orpheus.

==Gods==
{{main|Religion}}
In SlashTHEM, the Bard's pantheon combines music-related gods from Greek and Roman mythology:

*Lawful: Minerva
*Neutral: Apollo
*Chaotic: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_(mythology) Linus]

The dNetHack Troubadour's pantheon is Greek, perhaps Thracian ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace Thrace] was the home of Orpheus):

*Lawful: Apollon
*Neutral: Pan
*Chaotic: Dionysus

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)}}
The Bard is inspired in large part by the bard character class in Dungeons & Dragons, and similar characters.  

The quest and mythos also draw on Greek mythology, including the myth of Orpheus.

&&%s&& %s Drunk {148600 2022-10-05T06:07:50Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Techniques */* {{todo|Role exists de-SLEXed in [[SlashTHEM]] - retool accordingly}}
:''This article is about the Drunk role that appears in some variants of NetHack.  For the effects of quaffing a non-blessed [[potion of booze]], see [[confusion]].''

The '''Drunk''' is a [[role]] in the variant [[SlashTHEM]].  

The Drunk first appeared in an early version of [[SLASH'EM]] ([[NetHack-- 3.0.10]]) but was dropped from the code at the time the [[quest]] branch was ported into that variant.

The Drunk enjoys several unique benefits from drinking [[potion of booze|potions of booze]], in addition to the 10-30 points of [[nutrition]] that normally come from the potion. Drunks get an extra 100 points of nutrition from drinking booze, regardless of its [[BUC]] status, and are also healed by up to [[rnz]](20 + [[experience level]]) [[hit points|points]]. Drinking booze will still cause [[confusion]] and abuse [[wisdom]], however.

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Drunks could use any weapons.

SLASHTHEM balances some of the Drunk's weapon skills (removing [[two weapon combat]]) and changes the spell skills:

{| class="prettytable"
! colspan="2" style="font-size:larger" | Drunk skills
|-
! Max !! Skills
|-
| Basic
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[flail]], [[unicorn horn]], [[firearms]]
* ''Combat:'' [[riding]]
* ''Spells:'' [[divination spell|divination]], [[body spells|body]]
|-
| Skilled
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[club]], [[dart]], [[sling]]
|-
| Expert
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[dagger]], [[knife]], [[whip]]
* ''Combat:'' [[bare hands]]
|}

The Drunk's [[special spell]] is [[detect food]], which unfortunately does not reveal the location of [[potion]]s.  Spell success is determined by [[intelligence]].

*SlashTHEM u_init.c line 1500 in v. 0.8

==Techniques==
* XL 1: Booze 

The '''Booze''' technique allows the Drunk to simulate the effects of drinking [[booze]] without needing the potion, including the role-specific benefits. ("You procure some refreshing drinks.")

==Intrinsics==
* XL 1: [[Poison resistance]]

==Starting equipment==
* +0 [[rubber hose]]
* 5 potions of [[booze]]
* 15 random potions

The random assortment of starting potions, while not guaranteed to be desirable, may give the Drunk [[discoveries|starting knowledge]] of several harmful or beneficial potions, so the player can know from the beginning of the game which ones to collect or leave.  The potions may also be useful for [[alchemy]].

==Rank titles==
SlashTHEM has a different set of rank titles:

* XL 1-2: Wino
* XL 3-5: Boozer
* XL 6-9: Drinker
* XL 10-13: Alcoholic
* XL 14-17: Slosh
* XL 18-21: Partier
* XL 22-25: Tastetester
* XL 26-29: Winetaster
* XL 30: Socialite

SLASHTHEM role.c line 425

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Drunk fighting Colin Moriarty (possibly [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Moriarty this one]) for the Cloak of Neutrality, a neutral [[opera cloak]] which grants [[energy regeneration]], [[drain resistance]], and [[acid resistance]].

SLASHTHEM gives the Drunk a new [[quest artifact]], the Gourd of Infinity, a neutral [[horn of plenty]] which grants [[ESP]], [[half physical damage]], [[hallucination]] resistance, and [[drain resistance]] while carried, and can be [[invoke]]d to [[charge]] objects (compare the [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]).

==Gods==
The SlashTHEM Drunk's pantheon combines wine- and festival-related gods from Greek mythology:

* Lawful: Fufluns
* Neutral: Dionysus
* Chaotic: Pan

The lawful deity is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fufluns Fufluns], the Etruscan counterpart of Dionysus, rather than Apollo appears as the neutral deity for [[Bard]]s instead.

==History==
The Drunk's first appearance was in [[SLASH'EM]] precursor [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], as one of nine new roles in addition to the twelve in [[NetHack 3.0.10|the contemporary version of NetHack]]. The discussion thread in which the authors first announced the variant suggests that some of the new roles were taken from a list proposing a role for every letter of the alphabet. See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.hack/jg8YtQX1M3Y/tbBlteXdYY8J here] for the relevant post.

After the release of [[NetHack 3.1.3]] in 1993, NetHack-- was updated to [[NetHack-- 3.1.3]] by porting some of the changes from NetHack-- 3.0.10 into a patch for the newest version. Due to some changes in the vanilla code, however, some content was removed to improve compatibility with NetHack. Most significantly, NetHack 3.1 had seen the addition of the [[Quest]] branch. To avoid the challenge of fitting full-length quests for the roles that had been added in NetHack-- 3.0.10 into the patch code, those roles were simply left out of the patch.

The Drunk role, along with the other eight new roles in NetHack-- 3.0.10, made its reappearance in the variant SlashTHEM.

&&%s&& %s Anachrononaut {146611 2022-07-09T00:07:00Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Early game */ The '''Anachrononaut''' (roughly, 'sailor against time') is a role added in [[dNetHack]] version 3.11.0.  The Anachrononaut [[character]] comes from an apocalyptic future, and has been sent on a mission to prevent the end of the world, through means initially unknown to them. To aid them in this task, they have been equipped with a variety of '''future tech''', and can obtain more from their quest home level.

Humans, Incantifiers, Vampires, Elves, Drow, Clockwork Automations ([[Android]]s), and Half-Dragons can be Anachrononauts. Each race receives a different set of starting equipment. Anachrononauts can neither pray nor sacrifice, but they can still buy protection or use altars to check BUC status. Their quest artifact is the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|The Annulus]], and they are the only role that can use [[User:Chris/dNethack/Lightsaber_Forms|lightsaber forms]]. All Anachrononauts are unable to eat corpses and can only consume prepared food.

== Quest ==
{{main|Anachrononaut quest}}

In the Anachrononaut quest, the player fights a variety of tough enemies but no specific quest nemesis for [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Annulus|The Annulus]].

The Anachrononaut is tougher than the majority of other quests and has the added challenge that it is possible that the quest giver can be killed prior to giving out the quest - thereby eliminating the possibility of doing the quest!

==Gods==

{{main|Religion}}

Anachrononauts are assigned a pantheon of gods randomly chosen from the other roles at the start of the game. However, Anachrononauts cannot pray or sacrifice to any of these gods, as the only god in the future is Ilsensine, and She is not prayed to.

Anachrononauts can use altars normally to identify an item's beatitude by dropping it on an altar.

== Strategy ==

=== Early game ===
In general, Anachrononauts have a fairly easy early game. Future tech provides Anachrononauts with a combination of low starting AC, powerful melee and ranged weaponry, and useful tools. The specific difficulty will vary somewhat based on the particular race (and sometimes gender) a player chooses, as this will affect both equipment and race-specific abilities and bonuses. Elves may be the most difficult class to play early game, as they start with higher AC than many other Anachrononauts and many enemies in the Gnomish Mines wield iron weapons that do extra damage to Elves.

The highest priority for Anachrononauts in the early game is to obtain a [[tinning kit]] or other food sources, if they are not provided with one in their starting equipment. Because Anachrononauts cannot pray, it is easy to starve in the dungeon once protein pills run out. [[Sokoban]] typically solves this problem in the short term by providing a huge amount of food rations and other types of prepared food essential for Anachrononauts. Given the volume and weight of food rations, stashing food rations at the initial Sokoban level or in other strategic locations (like a magic chest) may be advisable, especially if the final Sokoban level does not contain a bag of holding.

A tinning kit is of lesser value to an [[Incantifier (dNetHack starting race)|Incantifier]] or [[Android]] Anachrononaut, but still valuable for producing potions of blood from [[lizard]] corpses; these can be used like a [[potion of acid]] against petrification in the mid- and late game.

=== Mid game ===

Anachrononauts have a difficult mid game, as future tech weaponry and armor becomes less overpowered against more difficult foes. Most powered weapons and blasters, for example, will need to be recharged, at the cost of valuable and limited power packs. Though [[Anachrononaut#Bullet fabber|bullet fabricators]] provide a means to resupply mechanical guns, the +0 bullets created in this way will only do so much damage, and carrying around a massive supply of highly-enchanted bullets for regular use may be impractical. As a result, a better weapon and improved damage reduction should be top priorities for the mid game.

The best weapon for Anachrononauts from this point on will almost certainly be the lightsaber. Lightsabers are 3x melee weapons when lit and can be used for a long time before needing to be recharged, especially if a player turns the lightsaber off when not being used in combat. However, if a lightsaber was not included in the player's starting equipment, the only place one can be obtained is the [[Anachrononaut_quest|Anachrononaut Quest]], as future tech can generally not be wished for.

For non-[[Android]] characters, the [[Anachrononaut_quest|Anachrononaut Quest]] has substantial rewards, but is dangerous even for players with a full set of ascension gear. On the left side of the home level is the Last Bastion, which includes two supply rooms filled with free future tech (including lightsabers), as well as a guaranteed deli (filled with protein pills and other prepared food) and a well-stocked bookstore. On the right side of the home level is the downstairs, which will spawn hoards of mind flayers and other dangerous horrors that will try to home in on your Quest leader - Sara, the Last Oracle - and try to kill her. It is entirely possible for these monsters to overwhelm the Last Bastion and kill Sara before you can trigger the quest, making it impossible to get your Quest artifact, the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]]. Though the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]] is not necessary to complete the game, it is necessary for a full-scoring ascension. For [[Android]] characters, the Quest leader is already dead, and nothing at all prohibits you from making your descent towards the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]]. However, the Last Bastion has been overrun, and the chests with free future tech items will have fewer items to offer you.

The difficulty of the Quest will be dramatically increased for Anachrononauts with [[Telepathy]], as these levels contain large numbers of non-genocidable mind flayers who can find and damage you via your latent telepathy. [[Incantifier_(dNetHack_starting_race)|Incantifier]] Anachrononauts in particular should hold off on trying to the quest until they have huge amounts of health or damage reduction to withstand the mental assault.

If you are strong enough to get the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]], it is a silver chakram that can be transformed into several different forms, including that of a double-bladed lightsaber that (unlike most double-bladed lightsabers) can be wielded with one hand. The [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]] can be invoked for infinite recharging and can be used effectively for the rest of the game, especially if enchanted to +7. The [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]] must be applied twice to ignite and then activate its double-bladed form, and special care must be taken to re-ignite it if an enemy spellcaster extinguishes it using a spell of darkness. 

Non-Android Anachrononauts using lightsabers can also select a [[User:Chris/dNethack/Lightsaber Forms|lightsaber form]]. Lightsaber forms are specific fighting styles that grant extra benefits, such as extra damage, dragon-breath reflection, or automatic counterattacks. 

While the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]] can be used as a primary weapon, it is important to remember that you will have to sacrifice it on the Astral Plane before ascending in order to achieve a full-scoring ascension. Consequently, having a backup weapon, such as one of the lightsabers from the Last Bastion, will be necessary as well.

A fast player without a full set of ascension gear could choose to raid the future tech from the Last Bastion and flee through the portal back to the Dungeons before hoards of monsters start spawning from the downstairs. If doing so, you would be well advised to wait until you're at least level 14 so you can unlock the Quest at the same time.

With respect to damage reduction, you have good odds of obtaining at least some form of half damage reduction from the [[Alignment key (dNethack)#Chaos Quest|Chaos Quest]] artifacts. If the Lord of the Rings version of the Chaos Quest is present in the game, you can get the [[DNetHack_artifacts#Mantle_of_Wrath|Mantle of Wrath]], which provides half spell damage. If the Final Fantasy version of the Chaos Quest is present in your game, the [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Earth_Crystal|The Earth Crystal]] can provide slotless half physical damage reduction. If neither of these are possible, a good early wish can always be spent on the [[DNetHack_artifacts#Shield_of_the_Resolute_Heart|Shield of the Resolute Heart]], half physical damage reduction gauntlets of dexterity that won't interfere with spell casting.

=== End game ===

One of the changes to the Anachrononaut game is that there is no [[Bell of Opening]] that can be obtained from the Quest. Instead, Anachrononauts will need to get the [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Silver_Key|Silver Key]] from the last level of the [[Alignment key (dNethack)#Neutral Quest|Neutral Quest]] to use in its place in the [[invocation ritual]].

Doing so is best avoided until a player has a full set of ascension gear. Monsters in the second half of the Neutral Quest are a variety of highly dangerous Lovecraftian horrors, including [[nightgaunt]]s, [[edderkop]]s, and [[shoggoth]]s, to name a few. Even worse, the last level of the Neutral Quest - where the [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Silver_Key|Silver Key]] resides - also houses [[Great_Cthulhu|Great Cthulhu]], who can easily kill a player with either his 400 damage melee attack or his permanent wisdom draining attack. Thankfully, Cthulhu is generated sleeping, and the [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Silver_Key|Silver Key]] provides [[branchport]]ing that can be used to immediately escape once it has been obtained.

Traversing the lower levels of the Neutral Quest is likely to cause damage to your [[Sanity]]. Consequently, you will need some way to either restore your sanity or stave off the random hallucinations that occur when players start to go insane. Blessed potions of restore ability will restore 20 points of sanity, and potions of sleeping and potions of booze also provide a small sanity boost.

Once in [[Gehennom]], the difficulty of the end game will depend upon the demon lords and ladies generated and which of them you choose to battle. Discretion is the better part of valor here - avoid picking fights with demons who might finish off an otherwise promising character. Having an excellent source of ranged damage, especially area of effect damage, can be also be highly useful. A well-enchanted, fully automatic arm blaster is a good choice, but high-level attack spells are a better one: spell casters with high levels of skill in attack spells can learn firestorm and blizzard as bonuses for reading the fireball and cone of cold spell books, respectively.  [[Incantifier_(dNetHack_starting_race)|Incantifier]] Anachrononauts can truly shine here, wiping out vast hoards of monsters with repeated spell casts, especially if they have found or wished for a spell book of finger of death. Likewise, [[Android|Androids]] can simply throw the Annulus over and over again at extreme range and have it simply return to their hand so long as they are not confused, stunned, or hallucinating, though this must be used with caution lest the Annulus fall into a pit of lava or be forgotten on the ground in some other dangerous spot and be lost. 

Once the [[vibrating square]] has been located, Anachrononauts must execute the revised [[invocation ritual]]: first, wield the [[DNetHack_artifacts#The_Silver_Key|Silver Key]], then, light the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]], and finally, read the [[Book of the Dead]].

Retracing your steps to the surface and making your way through the Elemental Planes is largely the same as in vanilla Nethack (but watch out in case any [[Dread_seraph|dread seraphs]] awaken along the way!). Then, once you have made it to the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Anachrononaut Astral Plane|Astral Plane]], you have two choices: either complete your mission to save the future and then ascend, or leave the future to its fate and just ascend. Saving the future is optional, but it is necessary to receive a full score for your ascension.

To save the future, you must find Ilsensine's altar and eject her from it by sacrificing the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]]. Ilsensine's altar is well defended by her attendants, [[Lugribossk]] and [[Maanzecorian]], who will spawn huge numbers of monsters to try to fend you off. You may need [[wand of teleportation|wands of teleportation]] to disburse the crowds and [[wand of death|wands of death]] to put the attendants to a swift end before you can eject Ilsensine once and for all. Once you have access to the altar, invoke the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Annulus|Annulus]] to eject Ilsensine once and for all.

Finally, you can ascend by offering the Amulet at your co-aligned altar.

== Future Tech ==

As a rule, future tech cannot be [[wish]]ed for, not even by Anachrononauts.  [[Tourist]]s, however, ARE able to wish for future tech, and may want to wish for a [[lightsaber]].  Some types of future tech will degrade if left in a [[bones]] pile, possibly even becoming nonfunctional.

=== Lightsaber ===
{{main|Lightsaber#dNetHack}}

=== Bodyglove ===

Worn in the [[shirt]] slot, a bodyglove protects against [[disease]] and provides MC3.  It does not contribute to AC unless enchanted.

=== Jumpsuit ===

A jumpsuit provides reflection and uses the body armor slot.

=== Force pike ===

'''Force pikes''' are powerful melee weapons that can also be used like [[polearm]]s.   Force pikes are one-handed and use the [[lance]] skill (and can therefor also be used to [[joust]], though they are just as likely to break as a normal lance).  They are a powered weapon, consuming 1 charge per successful hit.  A hit from a charged force pike deals 2d6+6 damage to a small target, and 2d8+8 damage to a large target.  An uncharged force pike deals 1d6 damage to small targets and 1d8 to large ones.  A force pike can be [[recharge]]d an unlimited number of times.  Blessed charging sets the force pike's charge to 100, uncursed to 80-99, and cursed to 10.

=== Arm blaster ===

An '''arm blaster''' is a high-damage directed energy weapon.  It is used by [[wield]]ing it and then [[firing]].  Arm blasters do not use [[quiver]]ed ammunition, instead consuming charges.  A heavy blaster bolt deals 3d10+10 damage to a small target, or 3d12+12 damage to a large one.  When a heavy blaster bolt either strikes a target or reaches its maximum range of 15 squares, it releases a 3x3 explosion of nuclear energy dealing a further 3d10 damage, for a potential total of 3d12+12+3d10 damage to the primary target and 3d10 damage to adjacent targets.  An arm blaster can be set to single shot, burst fire, or full auto by [[apply]]ing it.

Unlike most ranged weapons, a heavy blaster bolt continues traveling if it misses its first target, so you must always keep in mind what you're using to backstop your shots.  Additionally, a heavy blaster bolt has a 20% chance of blowing apart rock walls, potentially angering shopkeepers.  Blasters are also quite noisy, waking sleeping monsters on the level.  Arm blasters ("hard white bracers") are arm-mounted weapons, and incompatible with metal gauntlets, such as [[gauntlets of power]] and [[orihalcyon gauntlets]].  Blaster bolts reflect from targets with [[reflection]].  Blaster bolts are extremely inaccurate, and will almost always miss targets with low or negative AC.

An arm blaster can only be [[recharge]]d 4 times. Moreover, there is only a single fresh arm blaster to be found on the Anachrononaut home level, one fresh arm blaster on the quest locate level, and 3 scattered around the goal level.  This means there are only 5 fresh arm blasters in a standard Anachrononaut game, not counting the one a human starts with. The Anachrononaut quest guardians also carry arm blasters, but theirs are mostly drained and already 4x recharged.  Blessed charging '''sets''' the blaster's charge to 100, uncursed to 80-99, and cursed to '''10''' (essentially wasting one of the 4 recharges).  Therefore, to get the most shots out of your arm blaster, you will need a source of blessed charging.

Due to neglect, arm blasters found in bones files will be 4x recharged and lose half their remaining shots.

=== Hand blaster ===

The '''hand blaster''' is a smaller, handheld version of the arm blaster.  A blaster bolt from a hand blaster deals 3d6+6 damage to a small target, or 3d8+8 to a large target, in addition to a 3d6 damage explosion.  Hand blasters can't be set to burst fire or automatic mode.

A hand blaster has only a 5% chance of blowing apart rock walls, and can be used in conjunction with any handwear.

Hand blasters can also be recharged only 4 times; however, there are several fresh hand blasters on the Anachrononaut home level, and 10% of the [[changed]] spawn wielding hand blasters.  In addition, two hand blasters are spawned on the goal and lower filler levels of the Anachrononaut quest.

=== Mass-shadow pistol ===

A '''mass-shadow pistol''' is a charged firearm that fires duplicates of whatever ammo is loaded into it.  When generated, it is loaded with a rock, but any rock, grey stone, or bullet can be used as ammo.  To swap out ammo types, drop the pistol and #loot it.  Mass-shadow pistols can be [[recharge]]d an unlimited number of times.

=== Shotgun ===

A shotgun is a firearm that does 2d12+4+enchantment against small, and 2d6+4+enchantment against large enemies.  However, it has a maximum range of only 3 squares, not counting the square you are standing on.

=== SMG ===

A SMG is a firearm with both single- and auto-fire modes, reaching a maximum of five projectiles at expert on auto.

=== Grenade Launcher ===

A grenade launcher can fire both frag and gas grenades.

=== Assault rifle ===

An assault rifle is an upgrade to the SMG.

=== Heavy machine gun ===

A HMG is a firearm. It will only fire on full auto, but will surpass the SMG's multishot considerably (up to 9 vs 5 at expert firearms).

=== Sniper rifle ===

A sniper rifle is a single-shot, two-handed firearm with a long range that gets to-hit bonuses over longer distances.

=== Raygun ===

A raygun is a beam-type firearm that uses charges and can be charged an unlimited amount of times. Settings are sleep (1 charge), heat (fire damage, 2 charges), kill (death ray, 10 charges) and disintegration (disintegration ray, 20 charges).

=== Power pack ===

A '''power pack''' recharges items in the same manner that a [[scroll of charging]] does (though using a power pack while confused does not result in the character recharging themselves).  As the future tech of the Anachrononaut is explicitly magical in nature, power packs can be used to recharge normal items, and scrolls of charging can be used to recharge future tech. Power packs cannot be blanked as they are classified as tools.

=== Sensor pack ===

A sensor pack allows detecting certain symbols, like a crystal ball.

=== Protein pill ===

A '''protein pill''' is an extremely light, compact [[food ration]].  Like the food ration, it gives 800 points of nutrition.  Unlike the food ration, it weighs only 1 unit, takes only 1 action to eat, and never rots.

=== Bullet fabber ===

A '''bullet fabber''' is a tool that can be applied to transform rocks into bullets. Silver rocks will produce silver bullets. Silver bullets can be transformed into rockets and back. Normal bullets can be made into shotgun shells and back. Possibly somewhat surprisingly, it does not need to be charged.

=== Hypospray ===

A hypospray can be used to inject ampules. (These are like potions, but cannot be diluted as they are classified as tools. Blessing them produces a blessed potion effect, but they can't be used in alchemy.) Ampules are also found in the Anachrononaut role quest. Offensive ampules like sleep or polymorph can only be used against adjacent monsters.

=== Vibroblade ===

A vibroblade is a melee weapon using charges. It can be used to force locks without destroying a chest.

=== Cutting laser ===

A cutting laser uses charges, and can be used to dig through walls by firing it.

=== Seismic hammer ===

A seismic hammer is a [[weapon-tool]] using charges that's essentially a high-tech pickaxe. It is capable of digging a hole in the ground in only 1 turn, so it can be used to quickly escape.

=== Android Visor ===

Shows relative health statuses of creatures while worn.  Uses the "eye" slot.

== Sources ==

The Anachrononaut role draws inspiration from a number of different fantasy and sci-fi franchises, including Terminator, Star Wars, Star Trek, Underworld, and Dungeons and Dragons (most notably the classic D&D adventure ''[[Wikipedia:Expedition to the Barrier Peaks|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'').  The [[Firearm]]s module for [[SLASH'EM]] provided a lot of the foundational code for the future tech.

{{main|Quest}}
The [[Firefighter quest]] sees the Firefighter fighting Eddie the Pyro for the [[Fire Chief Helmet]], a lawful [[fire helmet]], which grants half spell damage and half physical damage while carried, and [[protection]] and [[warning]] while worn. It also can be invoked to summon a tame [[water elemental]].

*SlashTHEM artilist.h line 621

==Gods==
The Firefighter's gods all relate to fire:

* Lawful: Prometheus

==History==
The Firefighter's first appearance was in [[SLASH'EM]] precursor [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], as one of nine new roles in addition to the twelve in [[NetHack 3.0.10|the contemporary version of NetHack]].  The discussion thread in which the authors first announced the variant suggests that some of the new roles were taken from a list proposing a role for every letter of the alphabet. See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.hack/jg8YtQX1M3Y/tbBlteXdYY8J here] for the relevant post.

After the release of [[NetHack 3.1.3]] in 1993, NetHack-- was updated to [[NetHack-- 3.1.3]] by porting some of the changes from NetHack-- 3.0.10 into a patch for the newest version.  Due to some changes in the vanilla code, however, some content was removed to improve compatibility with NetHack.  Most significantly, NetHack 3.1 had seen the addition of the [[Quest]] branch.  To avoid the challenge of fitting full-length quests for the roles that had been added in NetHack-- 3.0.10 into the patch code, those roles were simply left out of the patch.

There is some evidence that the developer(s) of [[SLASH]] may have wanted to bring back some of the roles, including the Firefighter, as the DAT folder for [[SLASH 6]] contains unused maps for quest levels for this and other roles that are not actually present in the version. The quest leader would have been "Chief", the nemesis a unique [[elemental]] named Fire, and the quest artifact a fire helmet called the Fire Chief Helmet. The code for the maps indicates that the quest would feature numerous [[salamander]]s and [[efreeti]].

The Firefighter role, along with the other eight new roles in NetHack-- 3.0.10, was carried over with some tweaks into SlashTHEM.

A '''fire helmet''' is a type of [[helm]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. It has a [[randomized appearance]] and is made of [[iron]].

The [[Firefighter]] [[quest artifact]], the [[Fire Chief Helmet]], is an [[artifact]] fire helmet.

==Generation==
All Firefighters start the game with a +0 fire helmet.<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/u_init.c#L210 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 src/u_init.c, line 210]</ref>

==Description==
When worn, a fire helmet provides 1 [[AC]] and [[fire resistance]].

==Strategy==
The fire helmet is one of two sources of fire resistance for a starting Firefighter, and offers protection from [[falling rock trap]]s and [[piercer]]s. Even after they find a better helm (such as a [[dwarvish iron helm]] from the [[Mines]]), the fire helmet is worth keeping in inventory for the resistance until you reach [[experience level]] 15 and/or obtain the Fire Chief Helmet. Other roles without intrinsic fire resistance will likely want this as a temporary source to tide them over until they can obtain it from a corpse, [[ring of fire resistance|ring]] or other source. While intrinsic fire resistance is enough to justify removing the helm, note that it can be lost to [[gremlin]]s as well as from one of the adverse effects of sitting on a [[throne]].

Players attempting both [[foodless]] and [[crownless]] conducts might want to hold on to any fire helmets they find if they cannot find and identify a ring - once they have the property, they can replace it with a [[helm of brilliance]], [[helm of telepathy]] or other helm at their leisure.

As humanoid pets have very few items they can use that can provide resistances (such as the [[cornuthaum]] and [[zipper boots]]), they will appreciate being given your spare fire helmet.

==History==
The fire helmet is derived from a similar item that appears in [[SLASH 6]]; its data can still be found in the source code of [[SLASH'EM]].<ref>SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2 do_wear.c, [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/do_wear.c#line318|line 318]] and [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/do_wear.c#line382|line 382]]</ref>

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Firefighter's helmet}}
Firefighters have worn helmets for centuries to protect them from heat, cinders and falling objects. While their material composition has evolved from traditional leather to metals (including brass, nickel and aluminum), and then to composite helmets constructed of lightweight polymers and other plastics, their distinctive shape has changed little over the years.

The '''Graduate''' is a [[role]] in the variant [[SlashTHEM]].

It may be seen as a more challenging version of the [[Geek]] role from [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], an early version of [[SLASH'EM]] ([[NetHack-- 3.0.10]]); the role was dropped from the code at the time the [[quest]] branch was ported into that variant. It was later revived, renamed and given a quest in SlashTHEM.

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Geeks could use any weapons. 

SLASHTHEM adjusts and further restricts the Graduate's skill selection:

SlashTHEM replaces the spoon with a +3 [[sharpened pencil]] and the sack with an [[ugly backpack]].  It is significant to note that these are both items from the old Geek role in NetHack-- 3.0.10.  The pencil is a weak [[dagger]]-type weapon, but a useful tool that can [[engrave]] like an [[athame]].

==History==
The Graduate seems to have its origins in the Geek role in [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]] (a precursor to [[SLASH'EM]]), not to be confused with the [[Geek]] role added in [[NetHack: The Next Generation]].  The Geek was one of nine new roles in NetHack--, in addition to the twelve in [[NetHack 3.0.10|the contemporary version of NetHack]].  The discussion thread in which the authors first announced NetHack-- suggests that some of the new roles were taken from a list proposing a role for every letter of the alphabet. See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.hack/jg8YtQX1M3Y/tbBlteXdYY8J here] for the relevant post.  The post hints that the Geek role, like its NhTNG counterpart, is a tribute to the [[NetHack]] [[player]].

After the release of [[NetHack 3.1.3]] in 1993, NetHack-- was updated to [[NetHack-- 3.1.3]] by porting some of the changes from NetHack-- 3.0.10 into a patch for the newest version. Due to some changes in the vanilla code, however, some content was removed to improve compatibility with NetHack. Most significantly, NetHack 3.1 had seen the addition of the [[Quest]] branch. To avoid the challenge of fitting full-length quests for the roles that had been added in NetHack-- 3.0.10 into the patch code, those roles were simply left out of the patch.

There is some evidence that the developer(s) of [[SLASH]] may have wanted to bring back some of the roles, including the Geek, as the DAT folder for [[SLASH 6]] contains unused maps for quest levels for this and other roles that are not actually present in the version.  The quest leader would have been "Stallman" (possibly [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman this one]), the nemesis a [[&|{{white|&}}]] named "Gates", and the quest artifact a [[credit card]] called the Magic Calculator.  The code for the maps indicates that the quest would feature numerous [[x|{{white|x}}]], [[;|{{white|;}}]], [[spider|{{white|s}}]], and [[Snake|{{white|S}}]].

The Geek role, along with the other eight new roles in NetHack-- 3.0.10, made its reappearance in SlashTHEM, and was renamed the Graduate in order to likely avoid confusion with [[Geek|the better-known Nh-TNG role]]. The connection between the old Geek role and the new Graduate role is more clear in SlashTHEM, which gives the Graduate the Geek's paraphernalia, a [[sharpened pencil]] and an [[ugly backpack]].

There does not appear to be any connection between the Graduate role and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Graduate 1967 American film] of the same name.

A '''sharpened pencil''' is the starting "weapon" for the [[Graduate]] [[role]] in [[SlashTHEM]], carried over from the Geek role in [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]] (not to be confused with the [[Geek]] role in [[NetHack: The Next Generation]]).

As a weapon, the sharpened pencil uses the [[dagger]] skill, but only deals [[D notation|1d2]] damage to large and small monsters alike, making it inferior to a real dagger.  Its redeeming quality is that it can be used to [[engrave]] without getting dull, making it a kind of poor hacker's [[athame]].  This means that Graduates can reliably engrave [[Elbereth]] from the start of their game.  Even after they find a better [[weapon]], they may wish to keep the pencil as an engraving tool, [[fireproof]]ing it if desired.

Pencils cannot be used to write [[scroll]]s; a [[magic marker]] is still required to do that.
