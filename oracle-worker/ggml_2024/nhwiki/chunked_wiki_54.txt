==Strategy==
Loadstones severely hinder your movement and often render you [[stressed]] or worse, which will prevent you from using up stairs; to get rid of a loadstone, you must typically uncurse it first. There are several methods to dispose of a cursed loadstone:

* [[Curse removal|Uncurse]] the stone, then drop it.
** You can read a noncursed [[scroll of remove curse]], or dip it into a [[potion of holy water]].
** A successful [[prayer]] can uncurse a loadstone, since having a cursed one counts as a [[minor trouble]].
* Drop all [[mineral]] objects that you want to preserve, then cast {{spell of|stone to flesh}} on yourself; this will turn it into a harmless [[meatball]].
* Similarly, drop ''all'' objects that you don't want to cancel, then zap or cast [[cancellation]] at yourself.
* Dip the stone in a [[potion of polymorph]] to transform it.
* Allow it to be stolen by a [[nymph]] or other item-stealing monster; however, this is very unreliable unless you can ''safely'' ensure no other desirable inventory will be targeted.

===Testing for loadstones===
Naturally, one of the most effective methods for dealing with loadstones is learning how to avoid them in the first place.

The easiest way to test if a gray stone is a loadstone is to [[kick]] it ''before'' you pick it up - loadstones are heavy enough that they cannot be kicked under normal circumstancesny (i.e. with unenhanced strength, on non-[[ice]] squares, and without a kicking bonus). When testing this way, be sure to take off any [[gauntlets of power]] and [[kicking boots]] first, and make sure you are not a [[role]] that uses martial arts ([[Samurai]] or [[Monk]]) or in [[polymorph|the form]] of a creature with a bonus to kicking (e.g. a [[sasquatch]]).{{refsrc|src/dokick.c|7|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/dokick.c|552|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} 

If removing armor is not possible or desired, you can also compare kicking ranges: A loadstone should travel a much shorter distance than a harmless gray stone or any non-fragile object of similar [[weight]], like a [[rock]]. Be careful though&mdash;some bonuses add a small random amount to the distance.

As a mass majority of loadstones are generated cursed, you can also pet-test a suspected loadstone; a pet will only "reluctantly" move over it. This method also works on stones stuck next to undiggable walls, which occurs most often in [[Mines' End]] - but beware of [[level teleporter]] traps. Loadstones also only autocurse when they are dropped or leave the inventory, not when picked up - as such, you can safely pick up any suspicious gray stone after cancelling it, which has no effect beyond rendering it uncursed; if it turns out to be a loadstone, you can simply drop it afterwards.

Picking up a container with a loadstone inside will not cause it to stick in your inventory; a <code>pickup_burden</code> warning about severe encumbrance when lifting such a container is usually a sign of a loadstone, though keep in mind that large boxes and chests tend to be fairly heavy themselves. If you are still uncertain, you can #[[tip]] the container after removing all other items from it, then test the gray stone using the other above methods.

Once you have determined that a gray stone is a loadstone, you can #[[name]] or formally identify it so that you can recognize any future ones. If you need to read a noncursed [[scroll of remove curse]] for other reasons anyway, you might want to deliberately pick up a known loadstone. Beware sources of [[amnesia]], as you may forget the identification for the loadstone and pick one up; check your [[discoveries]] to see whether you still know the loadstone.

==History==
The loadstone is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
The loadstone is one of the many "treasures" derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where it first appears in the 1st Edition ''Dungeon Masters Guide''; it is also known as a "stone of weight". "Loadstone" is a pun on the word [[wikipedia:lodestone|lodestone]], a naturally magnetic mineral (which also alludes to its "sticky" properties).

A stone of weight causes a 50% reduction in attack and movement rate as soon as its owner has to move quickly in order to avoid an enemy; it also "sticks" to its owner and will always turn up on their person, no matter how they attempted to get rid of it. The stone could only be removed by casting "dispel evil", which would cause it to permanently vanish. The loadstone of ''NetHack'' behaves in a similar spirit: it "sticks" to the holder's inventory and inconveniences them by slowing them down with its innate weight; curse removal is similarly required, though it does not destroy the stone, but makes it possible to drop or otherwise get rid of it.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] does not change loadstones themselves, but adds the [[healthstone]], which is also always generated cursed and appears as a gray stone - this makes pet testing insufficient on its own to detect a loadstone in a undiggable corner. Belatedly, dipping a loadstone in a [[potion of amnesia]] will transform it into a flint stone, which you can then [[upgrade]] into a healthstone.

Be careful not to throw a loadstone&mdash;if you have autopickup on, you automatically pick up any items you have thrown.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], a loadstone appears next to the upstair of [[Asmodeus' Lair (UnNetHack)|Asmodeus' Lair]].

===Vulture===
When using [[Vulture]], you can see the weight of items, so it is much easier to avoid picking up a loadstone. Drop a junk item on any suspect gray stone: this forces the pickup menu to appear since there are now several items. Gray stones weighing only 10 are harmless to pick up.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the [[Center of All]] has a special projectile attack that launches a loadstone at the target; these thrown loadstones deal 1d30 damage and have a {{frac|3}} chance of adding themselves to the target's inventory instead of dropping to the floor, which can quickly weigh down and immobilize targets. Loadstones generated this way are always cursed.

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM notes above, [[lithivore]]s such as [[rock mole]]s can eat loadstones - this means that you can polymorph into a lithivorous monster to eat away a loadstone that you have picked up.

===xNetHack===
Loadstones are removed in [[xNetHack]], with the [[thiefstone]] being introduced instead - though also very troublesome when cursed, it can be put to good use once detected and uncursed.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], [[Asmodeus' Lair (SpliceHack)|Asmodeus' Lair]] uses the same layout as in UnNetHack, including the loadstone.

You can combine a loadstone with a [[scroll of identify]] at a [[furnace]] to create a [[crystal ball]].

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], [[Infidel]]s can freely drop or remove cursed items, including loadstones.

'''Digging for victory''' is a ''[[NetHack]]'' [[metastrategy]] in which the player aims to quickly reach the [[Castle]] and obtain its [[wand of wishing]] by digging down as soon as possible; the resulting game is called a '''"dig for victory"'''. In addition to a digging instrument, the player needs a tonal [[musical instrument]] (not a [[leather drum]], [[bell]] or [[whistle]] ) to open the castle [[drawbridge]]. [[elf (starting race)|Elven]] [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s are guaranteed to start with an otherwise-rare instrument; the elven wizard is the more popular choice for this strategy, due not only to the starting instrument but to the large selection of other magical equipment with which they begin.

The dig for victory strategy is mostly preferred by players who find it an exciting way to reach the castle in a high percentage of newly begun games.  However, many strong players do employ a controlled dive to the Castle if they do not yet have magic resistance or reflection after completing [[Minetown]] and [[Sokoban]].  This dive can take a variety of forms, from simply not exploring every dungeon level thoroughly to actually digging down all the way.  A player making the dive after getting some protection, building up a set of armor, and collecting wands is much more likely to succeed.  Reasons to do this include the avoidance of [[trap]]s which are painless with [[magic resistance]] (especially [[polymorph traps]], which can destroy armor, and [[teleportation trap]]s and [[level teleportation trap]]s) and being able to obtain relatively early immunity to the [[touch of death]] (for which some players would preferentially genocide [[master lich]]es over [[arch-lich]]es because the former is more likely to appear at the castle).

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|95acaf29897c734ba5eba0b497341455b3598d25|this commit}}, falling through a hole will inflict damage, expressed as an amount of d6 equal to the number of floors you fell - this means that you may end up digging a deep shaft and die from the landing, particularly if you are low in level and/or HP. Additionally, per {{commit|c29ffe1d823b338956de2517057b7e87ef64795e|this commit}} and {{commit|fe88fa80d82779986df494a10df950aa93d79cd7|its followup commit}}, neither master nor arch-liches can appear in the Castle.}}

==Execution==
A dig for victory usually starts with the player entering the [[Gnomish Mines]] and searching for a [[pick-axe]], where such tools are plentiful.  If the player did not start with an instrument, he or she will also usually look for one in the Mines ([[Minetown]] can have instruments in the [[hardware store]]). The player then returns to the main dungeon, and digs down until the castle.

Digging with the pick-axe requires multiple turns, so occasionally monsters will appear and halt the digging process. These must be [[scare]]d off with [[Elbereth]] or otherwise dealt with.  Worse, the player may encounter a [[minotaur]] (which ignores Elbereth) in a maze either just before or on the [[castle]] level.

Once at the castle, the drawbridge can be opened and closed at will by playing the [[passtune]], crushing anything that stands on it, which will hopefully be everything. Once the castle is clear, the wand of wishing is available for the taking. Beware of the bad [[Luck]] from crushing peacefuls, even if you plan on using [[conflict]]. It can make your [[wish]]es fail or turn out cursed.

Alternately one can perform a controlled level teleport to reach the castle.  This requires some form of teleport control (perhaps a starting ring as a wizard) and usually a cursed scroll of teleport, but occasionally a level teleport trap, if one can be located.  The castle lies somewhere between floors 25-29, but if one can always guess too far (e.g. 30) to go to the [[Valley of the Dead]] and come into the Castle level through the back door.  However, dealing with the monsters in the castle without the draw bridge and the trap doors in the back can make this difficult if you don't have a method to traverse the moat back to the front.  In that case, it may be better to teleport to floor 25 and work from there.

===Recommended items===
The following items are extremely useful for a player who is attempting a dig for victory. Although they are not essential in the same way that the pick-axe or the musical instrument is essential, it would be fair to say that a player needs to accumulate at least a sizable fraction of these items to have any chance at success.

A [[wand of digging]] is a highly desirable [[escape item]], because the direction of escape (i.e. down) coincides with the direction that one needs to travel. If the game contains a [[Big Room]], then a wand of digging will in all likelihood be essential for further progress, since a pick-axe takes too many turns to dig through the floor, and one is likely to be overwhelmed by monsters in the interim. A wand of digging is also very helpful for evading really tough monsters (such as [[minotaur]]s) in the levels above the Castle.

A source of permanent [[Elbereth]], while helpful for any character, is especially helpful when digging for victory. Sources of permanent Elbereth include:

* A [[wand of fire]] or [[wand of lightning|lightning]],
* A [[scroll of scare monster]] (especially useful when digging for victory, since it will drop through your holes with you, allowing it to continue protecting you),
* An Elbereth [[engrave]]d by any other method, together with some means of [[levitation]] to avoid smudging out the word.

It is highly recommended to establish a permanent Elbereth on the [[stairway|upstairs]] of the Castle level, and on a square within a knight's move of the [[drawbridge]]. The former will protect against the [[touch of death]] and [[destroy armor]] attacks of any higher level [[lich]]es that teleport to meet you in the Castle. The latter will protect you from melee attacks from [[xorn]]s and [[eel]]s while you are opening and closing the drawbridge. Make sure the second Elbereth is '''exactly''' a knights move away from the drawbridge. If it is any closer, either the falling drawbridge will kill you or you will be in the direct line of fire of ranged attacks from within the castle. If it is any farther, you will not be able to control the drawbridge.

A noncursed [[scroll of earth]] will create a defensive [[boulder fort|fort of boulders]] around you, preventing most monsters from coming near or hitting you with ranged attacks. It also allows you to cordon off a section of the Castle moat from [[eel]]s by pushing a boulder into a moat square, creating a square of dry land that eels cannot cross. In a pinch, it provides a way to cross the Castle moat if the drawbridge gets destroyed for some reason. If the Castle level contains a minotaur, the boulders can help block the minotaur from attacking you: minotaurs do not respect [[Elbereth]], so this is one of the few ways to keep them at bay. However, [[xorn]]s and [[giant]]s can pass over boulders, so an additional defensive mechanism (such as [[Elbereth]]) is still needed.

Having a source of [[reflection]] or [[magic resistance]] contributes greatly to survival in the castle. Of course, the idea is to have both, but in most cases a character with both is better off employing a more cautious strategy than digging for victory. However, a character with '''neither''' reflection nor magic resistance is extremely vulnerable to soldiers carrying [[wand of death|wands of death]] or other attack [[wand]]s. Magic resistance can be obtained by starting as a [[Wizard]]. Reflection can be obtained either from the [[amulet of reflection]] in [[Sokoban]] or the [[shield of reflection]] in [[Perseus]]'s statue. A character without reflection and magic resistance is advised to at least obtain [[invisibility]] or [[displacement]] to minimize the chances of getting hit by a death ray, although one needs to be aware that invisibility and displacement are of limited use in the long corridor leading to the wand of wishing, which contains a number of soldiers that cannot be killed at the drawbridge since there is a locked door in the way.

A [[wand of teleportation]] is useful both as an [[escape item]] and as a means of teleport threatening monsters away, especially on no-teleport levels. It is best to save this item for really dangerous monsters such as minotaurs or soldiers with a wand of death.

Some method of monster detection (such as [[potion of monster detection]] or [[telepathy]]) is helpful to receive advance warning of dangerous monsters. Similarly, some method of [[object detection]] is useful so that you know which of the four towers contains the wand of wishing.

[[Polymorph control]] is highly recommended. Try quaffing from [[sink]]s on your way down and turn into a [[xorn]] - you can then phase directly into a turret, bypassing the battles at the drawbridge and the throne room.

===What to do after getting the wand of wishing===
In a normal game, the player has already explored most of the dungeon levels above the Castle, and has collected all of the useful items in the dungeon by the time they reach the Castle. Thus, under normal circumstances, players typically know what items they are missing from their [[ascension kit]], and use the wand of wishing to [[wish]] for those items.

In a dig for victory, the player has '''not''' explored most of the dungeon levels above the castle, and will typically have far fewer useful items than usual at this point in the game. It is not advisable to wish for all of the missing items in an ascension kit, simply because there are too many missing items and not enough wishes. The best advice is to initially wish for only those items that are essential for immediate survival, and save the remaining wishes for later. Then go back up the dungeon and explore all the levels that were dug past on the way down, after collecting all the items in the dungeon, the player will have a much larger portion of their ascension kit than before, and the last few wishes from the wand of wishing can be used much more effectively without fear of duplicating already-generated items.

Common wishes in dig for victory games include some form of [[dragon scale mail]] (either gray or silver depending on whether one lacks magic resistance or reflection) and a [[bag of holding]] to make it easier to collect items on the way back up. Another popular choice is an [[artifact]] of some sort, since a dig for victory involves getting the wand of wishing earlier than usual: fewer artifacts are present, and the chance of successfully wishing for one is higher.

Characters who succeed in obtaining the wand of wishing are likely to be in a good position to enter the [[Quest]], even if they entered the Castle level with a low experience level, because the killing of monsters at the drawbridge results in a large amount of experience.

== Criticism ==

Like the [[protection racket]], digging for victory is nice when it works. Unfortunately, low experience level, interference from monsters, lack of equipment, minotaurs, collapsing drawbridges and purple liches all conspire to make the fatality rate very high, so that the strategy is also nicknamed "dying for victory". Because it is not aimed at maximizing the survival chances of a particular character, it is actually not a strategy but a [[metastrategy]]: it only maximizes the chance of one or more of many characters surviving. For that reason, some consider it to be a form of [[scumming]] behavior.

== History ==
Digging for victory is not a new strategy; however, the first mention of it by the name "dig for victory" was by SpeedEvil on May 19th, 2006  in #nethack of the [[Freenode]] IRC network (now Libera).

&&%s&& %s Protection racket {148828 2022-10-18T06:01:20Z {375 Ion frigate} Clarify that the Mines inhabitants are only replaced for dwarves and gnomes The '''protection racket''' is the strategy of reaching the [[temple]] in [[Minetown]] at a low experience level with lots of gold and purchasing a large amount of [[divine protection]]. As of NetHack 3.6.0, the protection racket is riskier as there is a 1/8 chance of Minetown not having any shops or a priest.

==Strategy==
{{main|Intrinsic protection}}
Use of your starting pet is essential, as killing [[monster]]s yourself will soon raise your level, and not killing them will result in your swift death. [[Healer]]s are widely considered best for this task, as the healing spell can be used to keep your pet alive while they do the fighting and the stethoscope lets you know when your pet needs your help. Two more advantages of Healers are the large amount of gold they start with, and their starting potions can increase their maximum HP without leveling up. [[Gnome (starting race)|Gnomish]] Healers have an extra advantage: more of the monsters in the mines will be peaceful. 

The stairs to the [[Gnomish Mines]] can be found on [[dungeon level]] 2, 3, or 4. On dungeon level 1, take the down staircase as soon as you find it. If you make it to dungeon level 5 without finding the mines, you've gone too far and must go back. Pacifists might want to go get the [[Sokoban]] food - they often lack the [[alignment record|alignment]] to reliably [[pray]].

To avoid death by [[pit]]s, [[gas spore]]s and the like, you might want to gain 1-2 levels before entering the mines and then [[level drain]] yourself in the Minetown temple. How many depends on your means, e.g. [[prayer]] if you do not mind your god's anger, the [[Drain life|spell]] or reverse-[[Genocide|genociding]] wraiths. Above all else, be sure not to lose your intrinsic protection too soon after you have obtained it.

===Race and role===
{{todo|Someone with practical experience needs to review the following for balance. Some advantages (knights jumping but starving, wizards pawning starting equipment versus credit cloning, arcs starting vs. anybody finding a pick-axe) are vastly exaggerated.}}

For characters other than [[Healer]]s and [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[Archeologist]]s, the chance of an inexperienced player surviving the protection racket is slim, and hence it is a [[metastrategy]].

Being a gnome or dwarf generally makes the mines easier. Stronger ([[strength|Str]]+[[constitution|Con]]) race/role combinations will be able to carry more loot with less encumbrance, making [[credit cloning]] easier. Being [[encumbrance|encumbered]] is almost always a big mistake, but more so when doing the protection racket. You are playing a near-pacifist, so you'll have a hard time finding food. If you are encumbered, you are making the problem worse. It is possible to get to Minetown with the required credit without eating anything at all, just praying when you are weak. (Kill one wimpy monster to get the necessary alignment.) But if you ever get encumbered, the prayer timeout won't match the hunger timeout.

Speed is also a key intrinsic for survival for your way to mine town.

Most roles have specific advantages at the protection racket, and all of them are perfectly capable of achieving it. The classic protection racket character is a gnomish healer, let's see how it compares to a:

* [[Archaeologist]]:
** [[Fast]]. Easy escape, remember: for now you are almost a pacifist
** [[Stealth]]. Can avoid sleeping monsters, such as nymphs.
** [[Touchstone]]. Can identify gems and potentially bankrupt shopkeepers.
** [[Sack]]. A lightweight container is a necessity for credit cloning when pet dogs and cats are little.
** [[Pick-axe]]. Can dig to [[vault]]s for money and holes in the floor of the mines to get to [[Minetown]] easier.
** Starts with some food.
** Chances of starting with a [[lamp]], which makes the mines much easier.

* [[Knight]]:
** Starts with a [[pony]] and plenty of [[treat]]s for it ([[carrot]]s and [[apple]]s). This means that credit cloning is easier. Horses are also stronger than cats and dogs, allowing them to protect you better. The downside to this, of course, is that if your pet maxes out its level after becoming a warhorse, it will think it is a match for shopkeepers and attack them on sight (hint: it isn't), so you need to make sure you've done all the credit cloning you need to before allowing it to level much as a warhorse.
** [[Herbivorous]] pet. The food problem won't be much of a hassle, because your pet will let you eat most corpses. In fact, your pet will be the one with a food problem, though this shouldn't be a factor until after the protection racket is over (if your pet gets hungry and you have found no vegetarian food, you can always give it an apple--just watch out for the "confused from hunger" message, or you could get killed by your own pet!)
** Can [[jump]], which uses some nutrition but is a good escape tool. You can't jump in dark areas.
** Can ride their pet to gain effective speed and prevent it from picking up unwanted items (remember, you lose [[apport]] every time a pet picks up & drops an item). There is a possibility that you will slip and fall, taking significant damage; however, this can be avoided by feeding your horse enough apples before riding to increase its tameness.
** Starts with a pretty good set of armor.

* [[Monk]]:
** Fast.
** Decent initial set of armor.
** Starts with some food.
** His initial spells (either healing, protection or sleep) are very useful for a pacifist.
** Chances of starting with a [[lamp]], which makes the mines much easier.

* [[Ranger]]:
** Starts with some food.
** If not elven, the [[cloak of displacement]] is useful for avoiding early monsters.
** Poor HP and HP growth. Non-gnomish rangers should not attempt this strategy.

* [[Tourist]]:
** Starts with lots of food. Usually, he starts with some [[tripe ration]]s too, which makes credit cloning easier.
** May start with a [[leash]], and always starts with an [[expensive camera]] and [[potion of extra healing | 2 potions of extra healing]], all of them very useful for a pacifist.
** His initial [[scroll of magic mapping |scrolls of magic mapping]] will make the Mines a breeze
** Starts with a decent amount of gold for credit cloning.
** Stack of +2 [[dart]]s can be sold for a few hundred additional gold.
** Lack of infravision and poor AC and starting HP makes this risky and a poorer choice than leveling up normally.

* [[Wizard]]:
** His initial inventory may be of some help for either credit cloning or survival while not killing monsters.
** May have the [[charm monster]] spell, which helps a lot in fights.
** Not recommended outside of fringe cases such as a pacifist wizard attempt.

===Surviving the Mines===
The mines can be very hard for a low level character for a number of reasons. The most obvious is that the mine residents can often kill a level 1 character in a couple of hits and there are lots of them. This problem is made worse because the mines are frequently dark, making the monsters difficult to avoid and the stairs hard to find. There are several things one can do to make the chances of survival greater.

* Get as many pets as you can and learn how to keep them with you. Not only will they be able to kill monsters more easily, but having more targets to attack increases the chances that enemies will attack them instead of you. Also, it's good to have a backup in case one pet falls into a trapdoor or is killed by another trap.

* If you have 15 or fewer max [[hit points]], consider [[pray]]ing with 5 or fewer points left to increase your max HP by up to 5. Do this before quaffing any [[potions of healing]], which will raise your HP even more.

* If you have any [[scrolls of magic mapping]], save them for the dark mine levels.

* Choosing a race with [[infravision]] will help you avoid monsters even when in dark levels. [[Gnome (starting race)|Gnomes]] are the best choice since the mine residents are more likely to be peaceful as well. If you do not have infravision, you might want to dig past the dark mines levels: Dig two squares of corridor into the rock where you arrive, displace your pet into the dead-end you created so it will stay adjacent, engrave enough Elbereths, and dig down.

* Remember that if it is a choice between gaining a level and dying, kill the monster. Paying for only 5 or 6 points of [[divine protection|protection]] at level 2 will still save you a lot of protection money down the road and help a lot as well.

* Some players recommend becoming level 3 before entering the mines to avoid death by traps and give you a hit point cushion.

===Determine how much gold you need===
Divine protection costs 400 gold per [[experience level]], offering more than this will not give more protection (up to 600 gold will give you the protection, any more and you get none), so you should make individual donations of 400*XL. If you have no divine protection, a single donation will buy you 2 to 4 points (it's random). After that, each donation will buy you 1 point until you have 9 protection points, after which you only have a 1-in-protection chance of gaining another point for every donation, up to a maximum of 20 protection points.

This means that if you make it to the temple at level 1, you'll need to donate 400 gold between six and eight times to acquire the maximum easily obtainable amount of protection. In other words, you'll ideally want to have about 3,200 gold when you get to the temple.

To donate the gold for protection, #[[chat]] with the [[aligned priest|priest]]. He will ask you how much gold you want to donate.

===Getting the gold===
There are many ways to get the gold you need:

* Start as a [[healer]] or a [[tourist]]. Healers start with a large amount of gold (1,001 to 2,000 at random), and tourists with some (1 to 1000 at random) as well, which can be donated to the Minetown priest.

* [[Credit cloning|Credit clone]]. That might not be a viable option if you don't have enough [[comestible|food]] for yourself and your pet (although there is usually a delicatessen in Minetown), and some might consider it [[cheating]].

* Loot vaults. You'll need some means of [[digging]]. A [[scroll of magic mapping]] or two would be nice but don't expect to have found and identified them this early in the game (unless you're a [[tourist]]). Other means of finding a vault can be found on the [[vault]] page.

* Sell [[junk]] to [[shopkeeper]]s. This requires extensive knowledge of item values since you don't want to carry 20 items to a shop just to find out they are only worth 1 gold each. Finding a [[Container#Bag_of_holding|bag of holding]] will help you carry more junk to sell.
* Sell valuable gems. An [[Archeologist|archeologist]] will always start off with a touchstone and can use an uncursed one as blessed, making it trivial to find and identify all the valuable gems and leave behind any unvaluable ones.

* Polymorph your pet into something strong enough to kill shopkeepers, then clear out the Minetown shops. This is dangerous for several reasons: you risk killing the priest, leaving you with no way to donate; you risk losing your pet and therefore your source of income; and you risk killing [[Izchak]].

===What to do after===
* Use that protection you just spent all that time and money on and get some levels.

* It might be a good idea to make your way back to the top of the dungeon and explore the rooms you haven't been in yet. At this point you might be low on food. Now that you can start killing stuff, hope for some lichen.

* [[Sokoban]] is also a good choice as the next step, if you haven't done it already.

* Continue downward to [[Mines' End]] to get the guaranteed [[luckstone]].

* Combine this strategy with the [[digging for victory]] strategy for the ultimate [[metastrategy]] experience.

* Take the racket to its logical extreme and go for a [[pacifist]] ascension.

No matter what you choose to do, the extra [[AC]] you got from protection will be a big help in keeping you alive through the rest of the game.

==Other information==
The protection racket is arguably considered the gnomish Healer's ''best'' opening strategy, and is a virtual necessity for conducts such as [[pacifist]] and/or [[Conduct#Nudist|nudist]].

To settle the perennial argument whether the protection racket is a generally viable strategy, [[Derek Ray]] posed the [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/0760e25393f22ba7# protection racket efficiency challenge]. It has generated much discussion, but no convincing, pure-PR ascension streak.

Examining over 35,000 NetHack 3.4.3 games by expert players (filtering out "escaped", quit, and start-scummed games), [http://www.codehappy.net/nethack/data.htm Codehappy found] AC gained in the early game--regardless of how it is gained--increases the chance of ascension by an average 4% per AC point. Successful protection rackets resulted in a 46% chance of ascension from that point and was present in about 10% of all ascensions; this includes pacifist conducts, which lowered the chance from 50% to 46%. However, Codehappy also showed (leaving out pacifist conducts) that characters who achieved AC -1 or better (in some other way) had a 48% chance of ascension. This finding suggests a character who finds a couple pieces of good armor can, and perhaps should, abandon the protection racket.

Further analysis (leaving out pacifist conducts) of Codehappy's data shows that Healers were responsible for 47% of all successful protection rackets, trailed by Archaeologists at 11%, Tourists at 10%, and Wizards at 5%. All other classes trailed distantly, with Barbarians faring the worst at 1.6%. However, it is interesting to note that 75% of Barbarians who succeeded at the protection racket also ascended--and only in one of those games did the Barbarian receive the help of an early wish. Note that these numbers do ''not'' represent the same number of  ''attempts'' by each role--an equal number of attempts may change those percentages. However, one can assume the expert players in this dataset know which roles are best suited to attempt the strategy.

The protection racket is considered a distinctly separate strategy from level draining later in the game to buy cheap protection.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In ''[[SLASH'EM]]'', it is also possible for [[Rogue]]s to attempt the racket, due to the significant boost in their starting gold, giving them more gold in the beginning than even Healers. Unfortunately, characters who would normally have peaceful Mines inhabitants will find they have been replaced with far more hostile undead, making the strategy far more difficult for all dwarves and gnomes, and Healers in particular.

'''Quetzalcoatl''' is the [[lawful]] [[god]] of the [[Archeologist]] pantheon.

The [[couatl]], while an original creation of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', is inspired by Quetzalcoatl's "feathered serpent" avatar.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
One of the principal Aztec-Toltec gods was the great and wise
Quetzalcoatl, who was called Kukumatz in Guatemala, and
Kukulcan in Yucatan.  His image, the plumed serpent, is found
on both the oldest and the most recent Indian edifices. ...
The legend tells how the Indian deity Quetzalcoatl came from
the "Land of the Rising Sun".  He wore a long white robe and
had a beard; he taught the people crafts and customs and laid
down wise laws.  He created an empire in which the ears of
corn were as long as men are tall, and caused bolls of colored
cotton to grow on cotton plants.  But for some reason or other
he had to leave his empire. ...  But all the legends of
Quetzalcoatl unanimously agree that he promised to come again.

&&%s&& %s Loot {146295 2022-06-26T03:37:00Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Variants */ {{Keyboard Commands}}
'''#loot''' is an [[extended command]] used to open an unlocked [[container]] on the floor. (Containers in your inventory can be opened by [[apply]]ing them.)  With the [[number_pad]] option on, the {{kbd|l}} key can be used a single-letter alias for #loot.

'''Loot''' is also the general name by which the stuff that you have found is called. It is often used in a context like "''In addition to the [[wand of wishing|wand]], I found lots of nice loot from the [[Castle]].''" Useless loot is called [[junk]].

== Looting containers ==
[[Large boxes]] and [[chests]] may be generated locked. To loot a locked container, you must first [[Container#Unlocking|unlock]] it.

Sometimes looting a container may [[Container trap|trigger a trap]], such as a [[poison]] needle (this only happens if you succeed in opening the box—it will never go off if it's locked). You can use the #[[untrap]] command to search the container for traps prior to looting.

When a [[bag of tricks]] is #looted, it will bite [[you]] (for 1 to 10 hit points damage) and become identified.

== Looting other things ==
The loot command can be used to remove the [[saddle]] from a saddled [[pet]] monster.

If you try to loot when there is no container present, you will be told ''"You don't find anything here to loot."'' If you are [[confused]], you will instead drop some of your gold and get the message ''"Ok, now there is loot here."''

Attempting to loot a [[throne]] while [[confused]] generates a [[throne room]] [[monster]] and deposits a random amount of your [[gold]] in its inventory (''"The exchequer accepts your contribution"''), unless there is a [[chest]] on the level, in which case the gold is put in that (''"Thank you for your contribution to reduce the debt."'') See [[Farming#Throne_farming|throne farming]].

== Configuration ==
The configuration option <tt>lootabc</tt> determines what keyboard shortcuts are available in the looting menu. When <tt>lootabc</tt> is true, the options are {{kbd|a}} - Take something out of the container, {{kbd|b}} - Put something into the container, and {{kbd|c}} - Both of the above. When <tt>lootabc</tt> is false, the respective shortcuts are {{kbd|o}}, {{kbd|i}}, and {{kbd|b}}.

==Variants==
===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], using #loot on pets allows you to give and take items directly, with respect to their carrying capacity.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], you can also #loot an adjacent pet to exchange items with it directly; selecting gear they have equipped will make them unequip and eventually drop it. In [[wizard mode]], this works on any monster. Using the command on a square with a single container will loot it without prompting.

A '''long worm''', {{monsym|long_worm}}{{monsym|long_worm_tail}}{{monsym|long_worm_tail}}{{monsym|long_worm_tail}}{{monsym|long_worm_tail}} , is a monster that occupies several squares. Only its head can attack, but if it is hit in the middle (even with bare hands), it may [[division|divide into two]]. Attacking the tip of its tail cannot cause it to split, and is thus a good way to kill long worms. Unlike [[purple worm]]s, long worms cannot [[engulf]] their enemies.

When killed, long worms leave behind a [[worm tooth]] along with their [[corpse]]. The tooth can be [[scroll of enchant weapon|enchanted]] to create a [[crysknife]].

Pet long worms and their baby forms cannot be displaced, which is annoying if you want to improve it with a [[polytrap]].{{refsrc|uhitm.c|318}} The DevTeam intended the whole length of a long worm to be dangerous, but currently software limitations prevent this.{{refsrc|worm.c|280}}

Long worms that spawn during level creation are usually generated asleep, unless you are carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]].{{refsrc|makemon.c|1035}}

==Elbereth==
A long worm technically respects [[Elbereth]] and other means of [[scare|scaring]]. However, if a worm is frightened but is currently stuck, it will proceed to attack you with its head and all of its tail segments next to you. This is the only way to see this in action, presumably due to a bug.{{refsrc|monmove.c|555}}

==History==

The long worm is one of the oldest monsters in NetHack history, having been around since [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]]. It is unknown whether its behavior was different than in modern NetHack.

Before 3.6.0, splitting a long worm could cause the game to crash under certain circumstances (see [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-324|bug C343-324]]). This bug was marked "fixed" after [[NetHack 3.4.3]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Sandworm (Dune)}}
The long worm represents a sandworm from [[wikipedia:Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[wikipedia:Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series of novels, specifically a small and very young sandworm. This is suggested by the encyclopedia entry, as well as their size and the guaranteed death drop of a worm tooth (which can be made into a [[crysknife]], as in the novels).

In the ''Dune'' series, sandworms can grow to over 400 meters in length and may even be ridden occasionally. The worms of ''Dune'' also contribute to the creation of the highly useful and desirable Spice, which is homaged in [[UnNetHack]] and [[xNetHack]]: if you eat a long worm corpse, the taste is described as "spicy".

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed". An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.

&&%s&& %s Body parts {146927 2022-07-22T13:34:07Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Eyes */ The '''body parts''' of NetHack characters are used during the game in many ways. If polymorphed into a monster, you may lack a body part and be unable to perform some task. Such tasks include wearing armor, so if you polymorph into a handless monster, your gloves will fall off.

Messages for different body parts are changed as appropriate, for example if you don't have toes in a particular form, it may refer to your "pseudopod extremities" instead. These descriptions are grouped by a number of different overall body types.{{refsrc|polyself.c|1131}}

==List of body parts==
All body parts are defined{{refsrc|hack.h|226}} for all monsters, although some are "empty"&mdash;for example, a headless monster still needs to reference a head for some messages. Included in the body parts are special areas for particular effects&mdash;for example, how to describe a light-headed monster with no head, or the "blood" of a being composed of pure energy. The body parts defined are:

* Arm
* Eye
* Face
* Finger
* Fingertip
* Foot
* Hand
* Handed (a generic description of the "hands"; for instance, if you have tentacles rather than hands, you are "tentacled")
* Head
* Leg
* Light headed (if you are headless, you may be "played out" or "addled" instead)
* Neck
* Spine
* Toe
* Hair
* Blood (if not blood, you could be losing "life force")
* Lung
* Nose
* Stomach

There are definitions for all groups of these body parts.  In addition to being groups, the above are also the names of the body parts used for [[humanoid]]s.

==Default (humanoid) form==

===Hands===

You have two hands and can wear [[gloves]] on them. The right hand is primarily used for wielding a [[weapon]]; the left can wear a [[shield]] or wield a [[Twoweapon|second weapon]]. Some weapons are [[two-handed]], requiring both hands to wield one.

If not wielding a weapon, you fight with your bare (or gloved) hands. Fighting [[cockatrice]]s or [[chickatrice]]s bare-handed is fatal.

====Fingers====

A [[ring]] can be worn on each of your two ring fingers. There is little difference between your left and right ring fingers; one difference is that, because all characters are right-handed, a cursed wielded weapon makes it impossible to put on or remove a ring from that hand's finger.

If you encounter an [[foocubus|incubus or succubus]], the [[ring of adornment]] is a special case. Incubi like to put one onto a female character's left hand, replacing whatever ring there currently is. This may be fatal if you are, for example, floating over some water with a [[ring of levitation]].

You cannot put on or remove rings when wearing cursed gloves.

===Head===

Your head can be fitted with a [[helm]], which offers limited protection against falling objects and [[mind flayer]] tentacles. Creatures with more than one head may still wear only one helm.

====Eyes====

There is also room on your head for something around your eyes: a [[blindfold]], [[towel]], [[pair of lenses]], or [[the Eyes of the Overworld]].

Your eyes can be [[Blindness|blinded]] in a number of ways, such as [[Put on|putting on]] a blindfold or being attacked by a [[yellow light]]. If your eyes are covered by a [[cream pie]] or [[blinding venom]], you can use a towel or [[Wipe|#wipe]] to clear it away.

====Neck====

Creatures with a head also have room on the neck for an [[amulet]].

===Body===

On your body you can wear a shirt ([[T-shirt]] or [[Hawaiian shirt]]), [[body armor]], and a [[cloak]], in that order. You must take them off in reverse order.

===Feet===

Your feet can wear a pair of [[boots]]. They are otherwise bare, so are subject to the same dangers as bare hands.

==Monster bodies==

The bodies of monsters are defined in some detail. Humanoid monsters generally have all of the above features, and hence can wear armor, wield weapons, and manipulate objects. Other monsters might lack hands or a head, or even a shape of any kind. The grouped body types are as follows:{{refsrc|polyself.c|1131}}
* [[Humanoid]]
* [[Jelly#Body parts|Jelly]]
* [[Animal]]
* [[Bird]]
* [[Pony#Body parts|Horse]]
* [[Sphere#Body parts|Sphere]]
* [[Fungus#Body parts|Fungus]]
* [[Vortex#Body parts|Vortex]]
* [[Snake#Body parts|Snake]]
* [[Fish]]

===Horns===

Some monsters have horns, and hence cannot wear hard [[helm]]s. [[Unicorn]]s and [[ki-rin]] have a single horn, while [[horned devil]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[balrog]]s, and [[Asmodeus]] have two.{{refsrc|mondata.c|304}}

===Eyes===
[[Floating eye]]s and the [[Cyclops]] have only one eye, while [[eyeless]] monsters naturally have none; all others have two.{{refsrc|mondata.h|41}}

The '''potion of restore ability''' restores lost [[attribute]]s and [[experience level]]s, back up to the previous maximums that the character had reached so far.

== Effects ==

A blessed potion restores all lost attributes and experience levels. An uncursed potion restores one random lost attribute to its former maximum and one lost experience level. A cursed potion has no effect.

If the potion hits a monster, the monster is restored to maximum hit points.

Breathing its [[vapors]] has the same effects as quaffing the potion.

==Messages==

{{message|"Wow!  This makes you feel great!"
|The potion was blessed}}
{{message|"Wow!  This makes you feel better!"
|The potion was blessed, but there are still other things wrong with you}}
{{message|"Wow!  This makes you feel good!"
|The potion was uncursed}}
{{message|"Ulch!  This makes you feel mediocre!"
|The potion was cursed}}
{{message|"<monster> looks sound and hale again."
|The potion hit <monster>, whose HP was restored}}
{{message|"Ulch!  That potion smells terrible!"
|You inhaled the vapors of the cursed potion}}
{{message|"Your eyes sting."
|You would have inhaled the vapors of the cursed potion, but are [[breathless]]}}

==Strategy==

This potion is completely safe to quaff, even if the [[BUC]] status is unknown.

This potion is by far the best method of restoring lost experience levels when multiple levels have been lost. The other options either have better uses than restoring levels, are hard to come by, or require tedious grinding. For this reason, it may be good to keep one or two blessed potions around if you are planning to face off against [[Vlad]] or other level-draining monsters without [[drain resistance]].  A blessed potion of restore ability is also useful for instantaneously restoring your levels after you deliberately [[experience level#Losing levels|drain them]] to donate to [[aligned priest]]s, re-allocate [[skill]] points, or reduce the difficulty of [[monster creation|generated monsters]].

The attribute-restoring effects of this potion are completely superseded by a [[unicorn horn]] or the {{spell of|restore ability}} spell. However, the potion is 100% reliable, whereas the spell can have a high failure rate, and a unicorn horn may take multiple attempts to work.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes. Alternatives include [[Potion of restore ability|potions of restore ability]], the [[Spellbook of restore ability|restore ability spell]], [[prayer]], or finding a way to exercise or increase that attribute again.}}

Surplus potions of restore ability are a prime candidate for [[dilution]].

== Variants ==
In general, this potion does not restore experience levels in variants based on [[3.4.3]], as that is a [[3.6.1]] addition.

In [[UnNetHack]], [[FIQHack]], [[dNetHack]], [[xNetHack]], [[DynaHack]], and [[EvilHack]], unicorn horns cannot be used to restore lost attribute points, making potions of restore ability much more important.

In [[Fourk]], unicorn horns do restore lost attribute points but are limited in the number of times they can be used, so this potion may be preferable in order to save the horn for more important things.

===SLASH'EM===
In SLASH'EM, the potion of restore ability has an important new use: magical polymorphing is usually temporary, and items and monsters will revert to their original form with time. If you dip a polymorphed item into a potion of restore ability, its new form will be "fixed" and become permanent.

==Identification==

This potion is very often identified for you when a monster quaffs it. It self-identifies only if you manage to observe yourself becoming invisible.

==Strategy==

See [[invisibility]] for details on being invisible.

A cursed potion of invisibility is useful for remotely waking up [[covetous]] monsters such as [[Asmodeus]], [[Baalzebub]], [[Orcus]], or your [[quest nemesis]]. Quaffing the cursed potion will awaken all monsters on the level, and covetous monsters, once awakened, will quickly warp to you so they can attack. This saves you the trouble of having to make your way across the level to fight them, and if quaffed while standing on the upstair, it can allow you to prevent them from escaping to the level above while you fight them.

Except for the use case above, this potion is a prime candidate for [[dilution]], as you rarely need many. It is best picked up to deny monsters its use.

&&%s&& %s Potion of levitation {148177 2022-09-18T04:34:47Z {4001483 Cathartes} account for the 1 extra turn separately {{potion|name=levitation|cost=200}}

The '''potion of levitation''' causes you to [[levitate]].

A blessed potion will make you levitate for {{rn1|50|250}} more turns, an uncursed potion will give you {{rn1|140|10}} more turns, and a cursed potion will give you 0 more turns. Regardless of potion beatitude, if you are not already levitating, you get 1 more turn of levitation.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|1033|nethack=3.6.6|comment=You get 1 extra turn if you were not already levitating.}}{{refsrc|src/potion.c|1067|nethack=3.6.6|comment=blessed}}{{refsrc|src/potion.c|1071|nethack=3.6.6|comment=uncursed}} These stack with any current levitation timeout you have; for example, quaffing four blessed potions of levitation in quick succession will provide 1001 to 1197 total turns.

In addition, upon quaffing a blessed potion, you become able to end your levitation at will with the {{kbd|>}} key (unless you have extrinsic levitation from some other source that would prevent this). This only lasts until the end of your current levitation - it is not a permanent benefit.

Quaffing a cursed potion also has additional effects. If you were already levitating and had the ability to land at will, you lose this ability. If you were not already levitating, you hit your head on the ceiling and suffer d10 points of damage (d6 damage if you are wearing any [[helm]]; d3 damage if the helm is metallic), unless you happen to be standing on an upstair. In that case, you will be treated as if you had entered the {{kbd|<}} command.

This potion is used in only one [[alchemy]] recipe: it can be mixed with the [[potion of enlightenment]] to sometimes produce the [[potion of gain level]].

==Messages==
Most of the potential messages produced by this potion are the same ones that any levitation source would produce. See [[Levitation#Messages]] for those.

{{message|"You have a peculiar feeling for a moment, then it passes."|The potion was cursed, and you were already levitating or on the Plane of Water.}}
{{message|"You have a normal feeling for a moment, then it passes."|The potion was cursed, you were already levitating or on the Plane of Water, and you are hallucinating.}}
{{message|"You hit your <head> on the <ceiling>."|The potion was cursed and you are neither on the Plane of Water nor on an upstair.}}

==Strategy==
This potion is useful in a few scenarios in which you have to cross terrain-based obstacles that can be crossed via levitation. Specific examples include:
* [[Medusa's Island]], if you prefer not to dig down and return from the other side
* The [[Plane of Air]], in which levitation allows you to control your movements
* The [[Plane of Fire]], with a lot of [[lava]] hazards
* [[Juiblex's swamp]]
