Strangely, in [[SLASH'EM]] there is also the distinct [[Count Dracula]] as a [[quest nemesis]]. So they are two monsters, derived from the same non-fictional Vlad [[wikipedia:Drăculea|Drăculea]]. Dracula's last words ("Mark my words, niggling! I shall return!") imply that they may be intended to be one and the same, though.

===dNetHack===

Vlad is adjusted in [[dNetHack]], adding a seductive gaze to the 3.4.3 version of his attacks. In addition, he now resides at the top of the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Windowless Tower|Windowless Tower]] with his 3 consorts. However, none of them are particularly threatening by the time one reaches his level, assuming one has acquired an [[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack Items#Random appearances with special properties|engagement ring]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the Birgau region of the Carpathian Mountains, in what is now Romania.  In Romanian history he is best known for two things. One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom. He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.

The '''giant''', {{monsym|giant}}, is a [[monster]] that formerly appeared in ''[[NetHack]]''. It serves as the "base" monster for the [[corpse]] left by killing a [[giant zombie]] or [[giant mummy]]. Its stats are identical to those of the [[stone giant]].

==Generation==
The 'base' giant is [[Normal mechanism|not generated normally]]. Zapping a [[wand of undead turning]] at a giant corpse that is left by a [[giant mummy|mummy]] or [[giant zombie|zombie]] will revive that mummy or zombie instead. You can [[wish]] for a [[figurine]] of a giant to create one by applying, or wish for a corpse that can be revived to create one; you can also [[reverse genocide]] to create several generic giants.

==History==
The giant was introduced in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

[[NetHack 3.0.0]] adds and differentiates most of the distinct giant types (minus the [[storm giant]]) while also introducing their close relative, the titan; the "base" giant remains in the game's data, since the giant zombie and giant mummy are among the newly-differentiated undead introduced in the same version.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]], it is possible to encounter living "plain" giants in the [[Giant Caverns]].

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], "plain" giants are among the court room members that can appear in retooled [[Special room (dNetHack)|throne rooms]] if the room's ruler is a titan.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|Giants have always walked the earth, though they are rare in these times.  They range in size from little over nine feet to a towering twenty feet or more.  The larger ones use huge boulders as weapons, hurling them over large distances.  All types of giants share a love for men - roasted, boiled, or fried.  Their table manners are legendary.

The '''stone giant''', {{monsym|stone giant}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is among the weakest of the [[giant]]s in terms of [[difficulty level]], but its base [[AC]] of 0 is the best among giants and second best among {{mcsl|H}} (after the [[titan]]).

As with all giants, they can pick up and throw [[boulder]]s, and eating their corpse has a 50% chance to increase your [[strength]].

==Generation==
{{main|Giant#Generation}}
Like other giants, stone giants can appear in [[groups]]. They have a 50% chance of being [[Monster starting inventory|created with]] a boulder, and are often generated with a small assortment of gems.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|183|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|706|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Stone giants may be generated in [[throne room]]s as early as dungeon level 13, and may appear when a [[throne]] at this depth or lower is [[loot]]ed.{{reffunc|mkroom.c|courtmon}} Stone giants are also eligible to appear in the [[Valkyrie quest]] and [[Caveman quest]], which have {{monclass|H}} as the second quest class.

A single stone giant appears in the secret passage of [[Fort Ludios]], and five stone giants are generated once the player reaches the [[Plane of Earth]].

==Strategy==
{{main|Giant#Strategy}}
Though usually considered the weakest of the giants, stone giants' low natural AC can make them troublesome to dispatch, especially if they have attack [[wand]]s on hand. However, they completely lack [[monster magic resistance]] and are also the slowest among giants, which makes them much easier to handle, especially with wands and spells.

==History==
The stone giant is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]] along with all the other giants (minus the [[storm giant]]), which were differentiated from the standard giant that appeared from [[NetHack 1.3d]] to [[NetHack 2.3e]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], two stone giants can be found in the halls of [[Grund's Stronghold]].

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], stone giants appear along with other giants in the court of [[titan]]-ruled [[Special room (dNetHack)|throne rooms]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|Giants have always walked the earth, though they are rare in these times.  They range in size from little over nine feet to a towering twenty feet or more.

Life draining / level draining in NetHack is relatively complex. The [[spellbook of drain life|spellbook]]/[[wand of draining|wand]], the artifact weapons, and [[drain life (monster attack)|monsters]] all provide apparently-similar life draining, and every source has the same effect if used on the player, but each does a different amount of damage to monsters. In addition both NetHack itself and the NetHack community use inconsistent naming, making any combination of the words "level"/"life" and "drain" interchangeable.
In addition, the level drain monster attack is affected by magic cancellation.

}}
The '''gelatinous cube''', {{monsym|gelatinous cube}}, is an [[amoeboid]] [[monster]] in [[NetHack]]. Unlike the [[Dungeons & Dragons]] creature from which it is derived, it has no means to [[engulf]] the [[player]]; however, it still possesses the means to [[paralyze]] the unwary. The gelatinous cube possesses two different kinds of paralysis attacks: the paralyzing touch is a melee attack that can be protected against with high [[magic cancellation]], while the other one is a [[passive attack]] that can be prevented by wearing a [[ring of free action]] or not engaging in melee combat. 

Their corpses are acidic, but may also provide fire, cold, shock, or sleep resistance. Like all [[blob]]s, gelatinous cube corpses are considered [[vegan]] and can be eaten without breaking the conduct.

Gelatinous cubes are noteworthy in that, as they move, they will eat [[organic]] items they pass over and engulf most other items (exceptions being [[boulder]]s or a punished player's [[iron ball]] and [[chain]]). The engulfed items are placed into the cube's inventory, making them useful for cleaning useless items out of a level. This also makes them the bane of [[stash]]es - if a cube eats a container, the container will be destroyed, though the items are recovered when the cube is slain.

Monster cubes will respect and not eat a [[scroll of scare monster]], but you can eat one while polymorphed into a cube. Eating a scroll of scare monster, a [[scroll of mail]], a scroll labeled YUM YUM, or any other paper item gives [[YAFM|special messages]], but no additional effect.

==Messages==
{{message|You hear a slurping sound.}}

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Despite its popularity (or perhaps because of it), the gelatinous cube is also widely known as one of the sillier role-playing monsters.  It is something of a commentary on the ubiquity of treasure-laden dungeons in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, as the cube is a creature specifically adapted to a dungeon ecosystem.  10 feet to the side, it travels through standard 10-foot by 10-foot dungeon corridors, cleaning up debris and redistributing treasure by excreting indigestible metal items.

The '''wand of teleportation''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

== Generation ==
Monsters may be generated carrying a wand of teleportation as a [[defensive item]].

== Effects ==
[[Zap]]ping this wand in a direction will [[teleport]] all monsters and items in the path of the wand;  you can teleport other monsters away even on [[no-teleport]] levels. Zapping a [[peaceful]] monster with this wand will anger it. Zapping the wand at yourself will teleport you and all items on your square.

When fleeing, monsters may zap themselves with this wand to escape. If they have the Amulet of Yendor, they may zap you instead, though this happens extremely rarely, and due to a bug, will usually not work.{{refsrc|muse.c|447|comment=Monsters with the amulet can choose to use their teleport wands on you.}}{{refsrc|muse.c|599|comment=Here the function mbhit is called when a monster wants to use a wand of teleportation on you. Note that mbhitm is passed in as an argument.}}{{reffunc|muse.c|mbhit|comment=Note the comment above the function: "Unlike buzz(), bhit() doesn't take into account the possibility of a monster zapping you, so we need a special function for it."}}{{refsrc|muse.c|1209|comment=Here's where mbhitm is called to zap you with the wand.}} On a no-teleport level, a monster will zap you with a wand of teleportation just once, wasting a charge, and will not try to teleport you again.{{refsrc|muse.c|605|comment=Monsters only bother trying to teleport you on a no teleport level once. Then they learn it doesn't work.}}

Teleporting the [[Riders]] has a 12/13 chance of teleporting them to a square as close as possible to you; attempting to teleport away the Riders' corpses will cause them to immediately revive, but will not teleport them.{{refsrc|teleport.c|1169}}

[[Engraving]] with a wand of teleportation will make any previous engraving vanish; unlike the [[wand of cancellation]] and [[wand of make invisible|make invisible]], however, you can find the engraving elsewhere on the level.

[[Apply]]ing a wand of teleportation to break it will create a damaging magical explosion that also teleports everything in a 3&times;3 area around you. See [[breaking wands]] for details.

== Strategy ==
The wand of teleportation is a versatile escape item. The only enemies that can resist its beam are [[aligned priests]] in their [[temple]]s or [[Riders]]. You can also use them to get out of engulfing monsters such as [[air elemental]]s by zapping yourself; on no-teleport levels, however, you can zap the engulfer from the inside instead (which teleports you and the monster together in any other case). Breaking the wand can also work for tight spots where you are surrounded or else need to clear some room to maneuver.

If you engrave-ID a "vanishing" wand, you can test it by zapping a monster or item; it is a wand of teleportation if the item disappears, or the monster disappears and cannot be found by [[searching]] or moving into it.

In areas like [[Moloch's Sanctum]] or the [[Astral Plane]], it's often faster to teleport enemies out of the way rather than killing them. Teleporting one of the Riders is generally a [[Bad Idea]], but if you are already in an unfavorable position you may wish to gamble upon that 1/13 chance by zapping an already adjacent rider or breaking a wand of teleportation.

An '''umber hulk''' is a [[monster]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' and the sole member of the {{white|U}} '''umber hulk''' [[monster class]]. It is one of the few monsters that can [[tunnel]] naturally (without a tool) through rock, a trait it shares with [[rock mole]]s and [[woodchuck]]s. It also has a unique, non-[[reflection|reflectable]] [[gaze]] attack that can confuse anything they glare at, including itself if a [[mirror]] is [[applied]] towards it.

Umber hulks are carnivorous, but also gain nutrition when tunneling; they are not [[metallivore]]s like rock moles, though.

==Generation==
In addition to normal generation, umber hulks can be created by the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]]. An umber hulk is guaranteed to appear on the [[Plane of Earth]].

==Strategy==
Umber hulks are the strongest tunneling monster encountered in the main dungeon, and move twice as fast as rock moles, though they are still much slower than even an unhasted player. [[Blind]]ing yourself will protect you completely from the gaze of a hostile umber hulk; confusing it by applying a mirror also makes it somewhat less likely to turn that gaze on you. However, it can still hit decently hard.

Umber hulks are generally utilized as pets or polyforms for their natural tunneling ability; tame umber hulks combined with a [[magic whistle]] can easily eat a path through large maze levels such as [[Gehennom]] without requiring additional resources, such as the high power cost of a [[spell of dig]], the valuable charges of a [[wand of digging]], or bearing the weight of a [[pick-axe]] or [[dwarvish mattock]]. Hostile umber hulks can also be useful for tunneling purposes, but care must be taken to avoid becoming confused or killing them.

==Messages==
{{message|Huh? That doesn't look like you!|You applied a mirror to yourself while polymorphed into an umber hulk.}}

==Origin==
An umber hulk is an insectoid monster originating from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. It has mandibles, exoskeleton and antennae like a beetle, but two limbs like a primate, and walks in a semi-erect manner similar to a gorilla. It has four eyes (two small and two large) and uses them to confuse unfortunate creatures that see all four at once.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose iron-like claws allow them to burrow through solid stone in search of prey.  They are tremendously strong; muscles bulge beneath their thick, scaly hides and their powerful arms and legs all end in great claws.

}}
The '''acid blob''', {{monsym|acid blob}}, is an [[amoeboid]] [[monster]] in [[NetHack]]. It is the first [[acidic]] monster most players will encounter, and also likely the first [[amorphous]] monster as well. Acid blobs do no damage on their own, but have an acid-splashing [[passive attack]] that can [[corrode]] [[weapons]] and [[armor]].

Acid blob [[corpse]]s are unique in that they are always fit for sacrifice,{{refsrc|src/pray.c|1370|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} and do not become [[tainted]] from aging similar to [[lichen]] and [[lizard]] corpses, though they will still rot away.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1616|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Eating an acid blob corpse will do 1d15 damage unless you are [[acid resistant]]; a [[tin]] of acid blob will not do any damage. Acid blob corpses are considered [[vegan]]-friendly.

==Generation==
Acid blobs may be generated peaceful for [[neutral]] characters. Reading any [[scroll of create monster]] while [[confused]] will create at least 13 acid blobs.

==Strategy==
Acid blobs will act the same as any other hostile monster, but are ultimately harmless; however, attacking them poses a threat to an inexperienced and/or low-level player, and their amorphous forms allow them to ooze under doors and block a player's path.

For some early characters, it is best to dispatch them at a distance with disposable projectiles like [[rocks]], or non-[[iron]] projectiles such as [[elven dagger]]s. Wands and spells can work, but are better saved for more direct threats. If you have enough HP to survive a few splashes of acid, then use a disposable/non-iron weapon, attack bare-handed, or simply [[kick]] them; the acid splash may still affect any [[corrosion|corrodible]] armor.

Past this point, acid blobs are little more than a nuisance that can occasionally erode weapons and armor if a player is careless in dispatching them, and proper erode-proofing mitigates even that annoyance. However, acid blob corpses have value both as long-lasting sacrifice fodder and a means of curing [[stoning]] - acid blob tins can cure it without dealing acid damage, but may take too long to safely open unless [[blessed]].

Later in the game, players may employ confused readings of scrolls of create monster to fill up a dungeon level with acid blobs and prevent other monsters from approaching; this is also occasionally employed to stop the [[Riders]] on the [[Astral Plane]] from reviving.

The '''gremlin''', {{monsym|gremlin}}, is a monster that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Its corpse is poisonous to eat, but has a 33% chance of conveying [[poison resistance]]. The [[Gremlin (monster class)|gremlin (or gargoyle)]] [[monster class]], {{mcsl|g}}, is named after them.

==Generation==
In addition to random generation, a gremlin always appears within the entrance hall in the second variant of [[Medusa's Island]]. More gremlins can be created via [[division]] if they make contact with water (explained in detail below).

Gremlins may be generated peaceful towards [[chaotic]] players.

==Description==
Gremlins are small humanoid creatures that have several unique traits among ''NetHack'' monsters:

===Gremlins and water===
A gremlin that makes any contact with water - e.g., a [[fountain]], [[moat]] or even a [[potion of water]] hitting them - will divide into two gremlins with half the maximum HP of the original. Gremlins can swim, and will actively seek out [[moat]]s and [[fountain]]s for this purpose, which may dry up said fountains. Gremlins cannot divide if their max HP is too low for them to do so (i.e., if their max HP is 1). This division does not respect [[extinction]].

===Intrinsic theft===
At [[night]] (22:00 - 05:59 server/client time), gremlins have the ability to steal [[intrinsic]]s with their claw attack. Each successful hit with the attack during this period has a 1/10 chance of removing an intrinsic from the following list:{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|1526|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Intrinsic-stealing}}{{refsrc|src/sit.c|400|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Possible stolen intrinsics}}

* [[Fire resistance]]
* [[Teleportitis]]
* [[Poison resistance]]
* [[Telepathy]]
* [[Cold resistance]]
* [[Invisibility]]
* [[See invisible]]
* [[Speed]]
* [[Stealth]]
* [[Protection]]
* [[Aggravate monster]]

A property is chosen from the list at random, without reference to your current intrinsics. If you don't have the one selected, the game steps down the list until it finds one you do have, or steps off the end of the list, in which case you don't lose any intrinsic.

The game tracks intrinsics (from corpses, altar work, potions, wands, experience levels) and extrinsics (from jewelry, armor, artifacts) separately: e.g., if a gremlin steals poison resistance from a hero in an [[alchemy smock]], the hero will still resist poison as long as they do not remove the smock. In vanilla, the only other method of intrinsic loss that follows this ruleset is to eat the corpse of a [[disenchanter]].  Note that innate intrinsics (from your role or race) can also be stolen;{{refsrc|include/prop.h|136|nethack=3.6.7}} in addition to the normal methods of gaining intrinsics, lost innate intrinsics can be regained by [[experience level#Losing levels|level draining]] below the level they are gained, followed by regaining the level (except for starting intrinsics, since draining below level 1 is [[instadeath]]).

The attack is ''not'' affected by [[magic cancellation]], though it can still be prevented by [[canceling]] the monster. A player polymorphed into a [[clay golem]] that is hit by this attack will revert to their original form, even if they have [[unchanging]]. When successfully used against other monsters, the special attack cancels them instead; clay golems are instantly destroyed as with other cancellation attacks.

===Gremlins and light===
Gremlins are harmed by bursts of light, as well as light-based weaponry.

* Zapping a [[wand of light]], reading a [[scroll of light]], or casting the {{spell of|light}} spell will do d5 damage to gremlins in the light radius.
* Breaking a wand of light will do (1 + charges)d4 damage to gremlins in the blast radius.
* Flashing an [[expensive camera]] will do d4 damage to gremlins caught in the flash.{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|3145|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Gremlins take damage from light}}
* A lit [[Sunsword]] does an extra d8 damage to gremlins (on top of the weapon's regular damage).{{refsrc|src/weapon.c|328|nethack=3.6.7}}

==Strategy==
If you find any gremlins around a significant amount of water, kill them quickly before they can flood the level. This is especially bad for chaotics, who may have gremlins generate as peaceful - killing them yourself may seriously lower [[alignment record]]. Pets with multiple attacks like [[vrock]]s are preferable as they have the most chance to land even one attack and kill the gremlin before it can retaliate; a [[magic whistle]] is also ideal for levels like [[Medusa's Island]] and [[Juiblex's Swamp]]. [[Conflict]] can also be a useful way to mop up a crowd of peaceful gremlins if there are far stronger monsters around them&mdash;beware if the gremlins manage to score any kills, as this increases their hit point maximum and allows them to divide again.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1831|nethack=3.6.7|comment=hit points gained after killing another monster}}

After splitting multiple times, individual gremlins will usually have a small number of hit points, perhaps as low as 1 hp.  Gremlins that have split like this can be easily killed en masse using a scroll, wand, or spell of light.  However, be careful if they are peaceful: light does not anger them before killing them, so you may be subject to multiple [[Luck]] penalties, on top of the alignment penalties.

Gremlins are generally unremarkable as pets outside of their ability to cancel other monsters. However, their division can be put to potentially good use in the case of both tame and non-tame gremlins.

===Farming===
{{Main|Farming}}
If you find yourself with a tame gremlin, but don't particularly want one and have a means of [[polymorph]]ing handy (e.g., a [[polymorph trap]]), consider allowing it to split a few times so you can polymorph the resulting gremlins into more powerful pets. If you let them divide as much as possible, you will end up with a legion of 1 HP pets that die once anything lands a damaging hit on them - however, there will be more than enough left over to ensure that you can turn at least some of them into useful allies.

While gremlins normally stop dividing once their maximum HP falls to 1, they can divide almost indefinitely if made to kill something via conflict; as mentioned above, this increases their max HP enough to divide further. Provided that non-tame gremlins are given enough time to heal and divide, they can be farmed somewhat like puddings. While cloned monsters do not leave [[death drop]]s at all and give diminishing [[experience]] returns, gremlin corpses can still be used for sacrifice;{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2432|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/exper.c|137|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} it is also worth noting that gremlins are [[followers]], and can thus be brought to levels with water via [[level teleport]] or [[branchport]]. See [[Farming#Gremlin farming|the farming section on gremlins]] for additional information.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Gremlin}}
{{wikipedia|Gremlins}}
Originally, gremlins were mischievous creatures blamed for mechanical failures in aircraft in the RAF in the 1920s; they were popularized by children's author Roald Dahl and a related Disney animated short. The concept of gremlins that multiply in water and have a vulnerability to light comes from the 1984 movie ''[[Wikipedia:Gremlins|Gremlins]]''.

==Variants==
In games and variants with the [[Lethe patch]] applied, gremlins multiply normally in [[lethe water]].

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], a chaotic character that is XL 3 or lower may receive a gremlin as a [[sacrifice gift|gifted]] [[minion]] from their god. The [[galltrit]], a [[deferred]] monster, is a type of gremlin that has a similar intrinsic-stealing attack.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], gremlins can always steal intrinsics, regardless of the time of day; instead of simply removing the intrinsic from your character, they also acquire the intrinsic for themselves.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The gremlin is a highly intelligent and completely evil
creature.  It lives to torment other creatures and will go
to great lengths to inflict pain or cause injury.
 
Suddenly, Wilson thought about war, about the newspaper
stories which recounted the alleged existence of creatures in
the sky who plagued the Allied pilots in their duties.  They
called them gremlins, he remembered.  Were there, actually,
such beings?  Did they, truly, exist up here, never falling,
riding on the wind, apparently of bulk and weight, yet
impervious to gravity?
He was thinking that when the man appeared again.

The '''blue jelly''', {{blue|j}}, is a [[monster]] in [[NetHack]]. It is [[blind]], [[sessile]] and cannot attack directly, but possesses a [[passive attack]] that deals [[cold]] damage.

If you attack a blue jelly in melee without killing it, and you do not have [[cold resistance]], it will gain HP equal to half the damage it inflicts on you.{{refsrc|uhitm.c|2447|nethack=3.6.0}} Attacking it, even if you miss, may cause the blue jelly to [[division|divide in two]]. ''(“The blue jelly multiplies from your heat!”)''.{{refsrc|potion.c|2217|nethack=3.6.0}}

Blue jelly [[corpse]]s are considered [[vegan]], and eating them may convey cold resistance or [[poison resistance]].

==Strategy==
Avoid attacking a blue jelly in melee unless you have cold resistance, as blue jellies are much tougher than might be expected, and their cold passive attack can be deadly to inexperienced [[player]]s. At their base level, they do (4+1)d6 damage, which gives a range of 5&ndash;30, and they can be generated at much higher levels.

Ranged attacks are preferable, but make sure you have enough ranged weapons to finish the job&mdash;you won't be able to retrieve that lovely stack of [[dagger]]s until the jelly is dead. The [[aklys]] is a solid option that likely should be used first - at worst, the aklys has a 1% chance that it will fail to return, but you will most likely do enough damage that you can kill the jelly with your remaining projectiles, preserving valuable [[darts]], [[wand]] charges and/or other items.

Blue jellies are frequently employed for [[boulder fort]]s, [[stash]]es, and the like since they are completely immobile.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
I'd planned how to prevent the lock from sealing behind me; it required a temporary sacrifice, not cleverness.  I used the door itself to help me cut off a portion of my body, after shunting all memory from the piece to be abandoned.  The piece, looking inexpressibly dear and forlorn for a bit of blue jelly, would force open the outer door until I returned and rejoined it.

&&%s&& %s Passive attack {146369 2022-06-28T23:21:43Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Electricity */ Some monsters possess a '''passive attack''' - it is used automatically in retaliation to a [[melee]] attack against the monster.  They can be avoided by use of [[ranged weapon]]s, [[pounding]] with a [[polearm]] or [[lance]], or being resistant to the attack. Passive attacks are ''not'' affected by [[magic cancellation]].

The most infamous example of such a passive attack is the [[floating eye]]'s [[paralysis]] gaze - hitting a floating eye normally paralyses the player for a period of time, during which they are vulnerable to outside attack - a cause of numerous [[YASD]]s.  Other well-known examples include the various [[jelly|jellies]], [[pudding]]s, [[mold]]s and [[acid blob]]s.

A passive attack is denoted by '''AT_NONE''' in the source code{{refsrc|Monattk.h|12}}.

==List of passive attacks==
Passive attacks against the player are handled in <code>[[Source:Uhitm.c#passivemm|uhitm.c:passive()]]</code>.  Monsters have at most 1 passive attack, which is defined separately from any other attacks they might have.

===Acid===
{{monsymlink|acid blob}}, {{monsymlink|spotted jelly}}, {{monsymlink|ochre jelly}}, {{monsymlink|green mold}}
* 50% chance of an [[acid]] damage.  If this succeeds, there's a 1/30 chance that your armor is subject to [[corrosion]]
* 1/6 chance, independent of the above, that whatever you attacked with (boot, weapon, etc) is subject to erosion
* Your [[strength]] is [[abuse]]d

===Stoning===
{{monsymlink|chickatrice}}, {{monsymlink|cockatrice}}
* If you hit with a bare appendage, you [[Stoning|turn to stone]] and die instantly (unless stoning resistant)

===Rust===
{{monsymlink|rust monster}}
* If the monster is [[cancellation|cancel]]led, nothing happens
* If you kicked it, your boots suffer the effects of a [[Trap#.5E_Rust_trap|rust trap]]
* Otherwise, 1/6 chance that your weapon/gloves are subject to [[rust]]

===Corrosion===
{{monsymlink|black pudding}}
* Exactly like the rust attack above, but with the more-powerful corrosion effect

===Magic missile===
{{monsymlink|Oracle}} (the source code comment is "wrath of gods for attacking Oracle"){{refsrc|uhitm.c|2222}}
* If you have magic resistance, no effect
* Else, you are hit with a magic missile attack

===Drain enchantment===
{{monsymlink|disenchanter}}
* If the monster is canceled, nothing happens
* If you attacked with an enchanted weapon/boots/gloves, they lose 1 enchantment.  [[Artifact]] weapons resist the drain 90% of the time, and ordinary equipment resists 10% of the time.

===Paralysis===
{{monsymlink|gelatinous cube}}, {{monsymlink|floating eye}}
* If the monster is canceled or dies from the blow, nothing happens
* If you have [[free action]], "You momentarily stiffen"
* If it is a floating eye and you have [[reflection]], you cannot see it, or it is [[blind]], nothing happens
* Else, there is a 2/3 chance that you will be paralyzed
* Being frozen by a gelatinous cube abuses [[dexterity]]

===Cold===
{{monsymlink|blue jelly}}, {{monsymlink|brown mold}}
* If the monster is canceled or dies from the blow, or if you are cold resistant, nothing happens
* Else, there is a 2/3 chance that you suffer a [[cold]] attack
* The monster gains half its attack damage in HP, possibly increasing its max HP
* If the monster's max HP is now high enough, it reproduces
The self-healing makes [[Blue jelly|blue jellies]] especially deadly to lower-level characters who can't reliably hit hard enough to offset the healing.

===Stunning===
{{monsymlink|yellow mold}}
* If the monster is canceled or dies from the blow, nothing happens
* 2/3 chance that you become [[stun]]ned

===Fire===
{{monsymlink|fire vortex}}, {{monsymlink|fire elemental}}, {{monsymlink|red mold}}
* If the monster is canceled or dies from the blow, or if you are fire resistant nothing happens
* 2/3 chance of [[fire]] damage
* If you are polymorphed into an [[iron golem]], you heal by the damage amount, instead

===Electricity===
{{monsymlink|energy vortex}}
* If the monster is canceled or dies from the blow, or if you are shock resistant nothing happens
* 2/3 chance of [[shock]] damage
* If you are polymorphed into a [[flesh golem]], you heal by 1/6 of the damage amount

===Sticky===
{{monsymlink|large mimic}}, {{monsymlink|giant mimic}}
* If you walk into the mimic without knowing that there is a monster there, you are affected by their [[sticking attack]], and cannot move away.

===Slime===
* Although the [[green slime]] has a passive [[slime]] attack defined, there is no code to handle it.

The '''quivering blob''', {{monsym|quivering_blob}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[NetHack]]. It is one of the few [[amoeboid]] monsters without a damaging passive attack.

Like all blobs, quivering blob corpses are considered [[vegan]]; they provide 100 [[nutrition]], with a 33% chance of conferring [[poison resistance]].

== Strategy ==
Quivering blobs are extremely [[slow]], and cause only minor damage with their infrequent touch attacks; between this and their lack of passive attack, they are generally considered to be no threat and are easily dispatched, making them a fairly low-risk source of poison resistance. 

==Trivia==
*Perhaps unusually as monsters go, there are no special cases in the source code with respect to quivering blobs; all the information about them is given by their status as a blob, and their stats.

A '''war hammer''' is a type of one-handed [[weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is the [[base item]] for the [[artifact weapon]]s [[Mjollnir]] and [[Ogresmasher]].

==Generation==
War hammers make up about 1.5% of randomly generated weapons (on the floor, as [[death drop]]s, or in [[shop]]s). 

[[Player monster]] [[Valkyrie (player monster)|valkyrie]]s on the [[Astral Plane]] have a 50% chance for their initial weapon to be changed to a war hammer - this warhammer has a 50% chance of being made into either Mjollnir or Ogresmasher if either weapon has not yet been generated.{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|239|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|270|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Hammer skill==
{{hammer skill table}}

The war hammer is the only weapon to use the '''hammer''' [[skill]] in vanilla ''[[NetHack]]''. (The [[Polearm#Lucern hammer|lucern hammer]] is a type of [[polearm]], not a hammer.)

==Strategy==
The war hammer is generally an unremarkable weapon, with lower damage than the [[mace]] and the [[long sword]]. As a weapon skill, it is most relevant for those who find or receive Ogresmasher and Mjollnir.

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from weapon skills, [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

==History==
The war hammer first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.3]].

The [[lucern hammer]], which existed since [[NetHack 1.3d]], was erroneously classified as using the hammer skill rather than [[polearm]] skill - a mistake that was carried over from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. In [[NetHack 3.0.0]], this led to [[Thunderfist]] (the predecessor of Mjollnir) and Ogresmasher having the base item of a lucern hammer instead; the war hammer was introduced in part to correct this mistake a few versions later.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|War hammer}}
[[File:Polish_Horseman's_picks_from_XVII_century.jpg|150px|thumb|A horseman's pick, an example of a real-world type of war hammer]]
The war hammer is a weapon that was formerly used in warfare, dating back to as far as the 2nd century BCE; its hit die are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

Real-world war hammers were quite versatile weapons and, much like [[mace]]s, were important for facing heavily-armored opponents. The blunt hammerhead would deliver concussive force through thick armor - including most chain mail and even plate mail - and the pick end on the opposite face could be used to punch holes, whether through a piece of armor or the odd skull. They could also be used in grappling.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] adds a [[heavy hammer]], a weapon that uses the hammer skill and is the new base item for Mjollnir.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], war hammers are made into a two-handed weapon that deals 2d6 damage to small creatures and 2d8 to large creatures.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black.  On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight.  The waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer stove in the dragon and the chest behind it.  When Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies scrambled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor.

&&%s&& %s Gray stone {146955 2022-07-23T14:04:23Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  In ''[[NetHack]]'', a '''gray stone''' is the appearance given for these four items:
* [[flint stone]]
* [[loadstone]]
* [[touchstone]]
* [[luckstone]]

Touchstones and luckstones are usually beneficial, and loadstones are usually harmful; flint stones are mundane. Distinguishing the four types is not hard, but to do so requires some tricks.

All gray stones except [[curse]]d loadstones can be thrown or slung. Flint stones may break when you do this (like [[arrow]]s and some other [[projectile]]s), but luckstones, touchstones, and loadstones can be thrown as many times as you want.

==Identification==

=== Loadstone ===

If an unidentified gray stone is in a container, use [[Tip|#tip]] rather than [[Loot|#loot]] to remove the stone. With some rare exceptions described below, the [[loadstone]] can then be distinguished by attempting to kick it; the loadstone will not move and produce a "Thump!" instead. Don't worry about losing the stone&mdash;only flint projectiles can disappear.

If the stone is greased, on ice, or in air (on the [[Plane of Air]]), and you are strong enough, it may move slightly. In that case, kick any non-fragile, light object (e.g. scroll, dart, arrow), and check if it moves further than the gray stone.

If your strength is 3, and you are neither Samurai nor Monk nor wearing kicking boots, all objects will produce "Thump!", so this method doesn't work.  Wait till your strength becomes at least 4.

If your strength is 22 or more, the loadstone may move in some circumstances, but not more than 2 squares, while any other gray stone will move at least 10 squares.  Alternatively, remove items providing excessive strength (gauntlets of power, rings of strength) before kicking.

All loadstones out of containers, and 10/11 of loadstones in containers, are generated cursed. If, however, you are a Priest and can see a gray stone is not cursed, it is safe to pick it up, as loadstones autocurse when dropped.  Similarly, it is safe to pick up a loadstone if it was cancelled.

=== Other stones ===

Rubbing an iron item on a touchstone produces its signature "[[scritch, scritch]]", which indirectly identifies it. If you rub a gem on a blessed touchstone, both the gem and the touchstone will automatically be identified. Gray stones count as gems in this context.

If you can kick the gray stone and it does not produce the message "scritch, scritch" when an iron item is rubbed on it, you have either a flintstone or a luckstone. The two can be separated by [[price identification]]; flint's base price is 1zm, and a luckstone's is 60zm. You can also use [[enlightenment]] to determine whether you are carrying a luckstone ("You have &lt;extra/reduced&gt; luck").

If a monster picks it up and isn't carrying a sling, it very likely is not flint, since most monsters only like magic objects.

Once you have distinguished one of the gray stones, you can type-[[name]] it to distinguish subsequent gray stones.
