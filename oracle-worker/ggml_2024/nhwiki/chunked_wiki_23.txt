Before Mjollnir was introduced, an [[artifact]] [[lucern hammer]] named [[Thunderfist]] was present in [[NetHack 3.0.0]]; in [[3.0.3]], Mjollnir was introduced as a replacement, apparently because the lucern hammer was a [[polearm]] mistaken for a "standard" hammer weapon.

The throwing requirements and special behavior for Valkyries first appeared in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Mjölnir}}
Mjölnir (from Old Norse Mjǫllnir) is the hammer of the thunder god Thor in Norse mythology, used both as a devastating weapon and as a divine instrument to provide blessings. Thor and his hammer appear depicted on a variety of objects from archaeological record, including the runic [[wikipedia:Kvinneby amulet|Kvinneby amulet]] from the 11th century, and in numerous sources including the ''[[wikipedia:Poetic Edda|Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[wikipedia:Prose Edda|Prose Edda]]'' of the the 13th century. One book of the ''Prose Edda'', ''Gylfaginning'' describes the god Thor and his "three special possessions", including Mjölnir and a pair of iron gloves called "[[wikipedia:Járngreipr|Járngreipr]] that he must wear with his hammer; this is likely the basis for the strength requirement to throw the artifact weapon in ''[[NetHack]]'', which can only be typically achieved via gauntlets of power.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
Mjollnir's weak base damage is somewhat ameliorated in [[SLASH'EM]], where it is instead a [[heavy hammer]] with base damage of 1d6 against both small and large foes; the new base item is also made of [[metal]], making it inherently rustproof. In addition, changes to artifact weapon bonuses mean that Mjollnir is far more formidable, with +5 to-hit and +24 damage bonuses; artifact weapons can also be [[twoweapon]]ed in the off-hand, making Mjollnir a very powerful artifact overall and an especially enticing off-hand candidate.

[[Gauntlets of power]] also behave differently, however, setting strength to 18/** when worn and augmenting it further based on enchantment - while obtaining 25 strength to throw Mjollnir using these gloves is ''generally'' more difficult, Valkyries can safely enchant gauntlets of power to +7.

====Average damage calculation====
The damage calculation below assumes a player with Expert skill in hammer, which gives a +2 damage bonus. A blessed weapon deals 1d4 extra damage against [[demon]]s and [[undead]]. The worst case scenario is against a [[shock resistant]], non-undead, non-demon monster. The best case scenario is against a non-shock resistant, undead/demon monster.

|}

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Mjollnir's base item is instead the [[heavy war hammer]], which deals d8 to small monsters and d10 to large monsters. Priests of all alignmnets that are [[crowned]] will receive Mjollnir as their crowning gift, which is done in a manner akin to [[Excalibur]]: if you are a Priest wielding a heavy war hammer and Mjollnir has not yet been generated at the time of crowning, the hammer will be transformed into Mjollnir.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], all heavy war hammers including Mjollnir are [[two-handed]], so it can no longer be twoweaponed or wielded with a [[shield]]. This decreases its utility for some neutral playstyles that rely on twoweapon or access to the shield slot (e.g. for a [[shield of reflection]]), but the artifact remains a powerful source of damage.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]] and [[SpliceHack-Rewrite]], Mjollnir can be [[invoke]]d to fire a thunderbolt similar to the [[wand of lightning]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Forged by the dwarves Eitri and Brokk, in response to Loki's challenge, Mjollnir is an indestructible war hammer.  It has two magical properties:  when thrown it always returned to Thor's hand; and it could be made to shrink in size until it could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of "vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births, weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's governance over the entire cycle of life - fertility, birth, destruction, and resurrection.

'''Magicbane''' is an [[artifact weapon|artifact]] [[athame]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[neutral]] and is the guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Wizard]]s.

==Generation==
[[Arch-liches]] have a minuscule chance (1/1170, or approximately 0.085%) of being generated with Magicbane.

==Description==
Magicbane has a +d3 to-hit bonus, and hitting a monster with it has a 40% chance of inflicting a magical effect and dealing +1d4 damage to the victim in that order, subject to [[Magic resistance (monster)|monster MR]] or player-style magic resistance. When thrown, Magicbane will do the same to a monster it hits, though this is obviously impractical.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|961|nethack=3.6.6|comment=function <code>Mb_hit()</code>|name=Mb_hit}} The probability of each applicable magical effect is determined by Magicbane's [[enchantment]] - Magicbane will react as follows when enchanted to certain thresholds:

{{message|Your right hand itches!|Magicbane's has been enchanted to +0 or +1.}}
{{message|Your right hand flinches.|Magicbane has been enchanted to +2 or above.}}

Magicbane also grants [[magic resistance]] while wielded, and will also absorb and negate 95% of of curses directed at its wielder. As its [[base item]] type is an athame, Magicbane can engrave a semi-permanent [[Elbereth]] in one turn without dulling like other athames (unless it is cursed).

===Magical effects===
There are four "bonus" effects that Magicbane can produce upon hitting, with details listed below:

{| class="prettytable striped"
!Effect!!Details!!Notes
|-
|[[Probe]] monster||Reveals the monster's HP, [[AC]] and inventory as if zapped with a [[wand of probing]]||'Replaces' other effects as enchantment increases
|-
|[[Stun]] monster||Stuns the attacked monster.||Odds drop significantly once Magicbane is enchanted
|-
|[[Scare]] monster||Scares the attacked monster.||Odds drop significantly once enchanted past +2
|-
|[[Cancel]] monster||Cancels the attacked monster as if zapped with the [[spellbook of cancellation|spell]] or [[wand of cancellation]]. If the cancelled monster is a [[monster spell|spellcaster]], you will also absorb [[energy]] and increase your current and maximum energy by 1.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1051|nethack=3.6.6}}||Odds drop significantly once enchanted past +2<br/>Absorption occurs regardless of if the target is already canceled
|}

==Strategy==
===Enchanting===
The chance of stunning drops progressively from +0, scaring and cancellation drop progressively after +2, and cancellation is eliminated after +5; probing takes their place. However, the average damage it inflicts increases with each level of enchantment, which is typically desirable for dealing maximum damage as a primary weapon.<ref>http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/art2-343.html</ref>

Increasing Magicbane's enchantment from +6 to +7 is typically not worth the effort. As with other weapons, you need to lower it to +5 to safely attempt to enchant to +7, but lowering Magicbane's enchantment can be very difficult: because it's an [[athame]], engraving with it will not dull it, and because it's an [[artifact]], it will resist most attempts at disenchantment from a cursed [[scroll of enchant weapon]]. {{spell of|Drain life}} can work, but typically takes many attempts. Hitting a [[disenchanter]] with Magicbane can also work, though the disenchanter may be able to disenchant your armor if you stand around hitting it for too long (the attack is subject to [[magic cancellation]], so this is rarely a major issue by the time you're worried about enchanting Magicbane to +7).

If you have copious amounts amounts of {{of|potion|holy water|and=1|unholy water}} on hand, it is also possible to lower Magicbane's enchantment by cursing it with unholy water and engraving a single letter with it. Remember to re-bless it afterward.

===Damage===
[[Strength]], [[skill]] and [[blessed]] damage bonuses are also added.

Note the progressive drop of stun from +0, the progressive drop of scare and cancel after +2, and cancel is eliminated after +5 while average damage keeps increasing.

===Exact mechanics===
The base damage is 1d4 to small monsters and 1d3 to large monsters.  If the monster fails a [[Magic_resistance_(monster)|magic resistance]] check, an additional 1d4 damage is added to the base damage and the further special attacks are more likely.  This magic resistance check is, however, an unusual one, because it doesn't consider level bonuses.  There is an 8 / 20 (40%) chance of an additional +1d4 damage and possibly more.  Given there is additional damage:
* There is a chance of an additional +1d4 stun damage.
** If the monster failed the previous magic resistance check, the probability of this stun damage is <math>\frac{10 - \max(\mathrm{enchantment}, 0)}{11}</math>.
** If the monster passed the magic resistance check, the probability of this stun damage is <math>\frac{6 - \max(\mathrm{enchantment}, 0)}{7}</math>.
* There is a chance of an additional +1d4 scare damage or +2d4 scare & cancellation damage.
** The roll for scare or cancellation damage is scaled by <math>z = 2^{\max(\mathrm{enchantment}, 0) \; \mathrm{div} \;3}</math>, where <math>\mathrm{div}</math> is integer division.  The base roll for scare damage is <math>R_{\mathrm{scare}} = 4 \; \mathrm{div} \; z</math> and the base roll for cancellation damage is <math>R_{\mathrm{cancel}} = 2 \; \mathrm{div} \; z</math>.  <ref>(The rolls are out of 20, but require at least an 8 out of 20, which is why 8 is used as the denominator below).</ref>
*** If the monster failed the previous magic resistance check, the probability of scare damage is simply <math>p_{\mathrm{scare}} = \frac{R_{\mathrm{scare}}}{8}</math> and the probability of cancellation damage is simply <math>p_{\mathrm{cancel}} = \frac{R_{\mathrm{cancel}}}{8}</math>.
*** If the monster passed the previous magic resistance check, the probability of scare damage is <math>p_{\mathrm{scare}} = \frac{\max(R_{\mathrm{scare}} - 1, 0)}{8}</math> and the probability of cancellation damage is <math>p_{\mathrm{cancel}} = \frac{\max(R_{\mathrm{cancel}} - 1, 0)}{8}</math>.
** Exactly one of the following occurs:
*** The probability of +1d4 [[scare]] damage is <math>p_{\mathrm{scare}} - p_{\mathrm{cancel}}</math>.
*** The probability of +2d4 [[scare]] & [[cancellation]] damage is <math>p_{\mathrm{cancel}}</math>.  (Note that this means there is a <math>p_{\mathrm{scare}}</math> probability of +1d4 scare and a <math>p_{\mathrm{cancel}}</math> probability of +1d4 cancellation, which is used in the table below.) 
*** The probability of no [[scare]] or [[cancellation]] damage is <math>1 - p_{\mathrm{scare}} - p_{\mathrm{cancel}}</math>.
**** If there is also no stun damage, the attack [[probe]]s. The probe has a 1 in (abs(enchantment) * 3) of being insightful and actually probing the monster, otherwise nothing happens. The +0 magicbane will always successfully probe the target. 
* Finally, there is a 1-in-12 chance of confusing the target with any magical attack. This chance is not affected by enchantment.
The monster can resist the [[scare]] and [[cancellation]] effects using a [[Magic resistance (monster)]] check (if you are attacked, you resist if you have [[Magic resistance]] instead), but the extra damage of these effects is dealt even in that case.  The monster cannot resist the [[stun]], [[probe]], or [[confuse]] effects.<ref name="Mb_hit" />

Magicbane is introduced in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

In [[SLASH'EM]], as with other SLASH'EM artifacts, a target that fails a magic resistance check takes a flat bonus of +4 damage, rather than +1d4;<ref>[[Source:SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/artifact.c]].</ref> this adds 1.5 to the mean damage for such attacks. Additionally, Magicbane can hit through [[Need +x weapon to hit|enchantment resistance]] (requiring an enchanted weapon to hit) and is technically the only such weapon that can do so - [[lightsaber]]s are also capable of this, though they are considered [[tool]]s by the game.

SLASH'EM also gives the option of wielding artifacts in the offhand while [[twoweaponing]] - however, Magicbane will not convey its curse or magic resistance unless it is wielded as a primary weapon.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], the base item for Magicbane is a [[quarterstaff]],<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/865c9091803e844b66255e122877ae6c70950e51/libnethack/include/artilist.h#L126</ref> improving Magicbane's base damage but making it a two-handed weapon. All staves, including Magicbane, enhance spellcasting in the same way [[robe]]s do.<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/865c9091803e844b66255e122877ae6c70950e51/libnethack/src/spell.c#L2272</ref> Besides these traits, Magicbane retains its usual effects - magic resistance, special attacks, and curse protection.

===dNetHack===

In [[dNetHack]] Magicbane is more powerful vs. monsters that resist magic (it requires powerful magic to resist magic, and Magicbane is effective against such magic). Each magical effect that triggers deals an additional 6d6 (6-36) damage to targets that have player-style MR or that have passed their monster MR check. Magicbane also receives a +10% bonus to the chances of the probing, scare monster, and cancellation effects occurring vs. such targets. Wizards in dNetHack are therefore advised to leave Magicbane unenchanted to maximize the chances of the additional magical effects occurring when fighting magic-resistant foes.

===EvilHack===

In [[EvilHack]], the base item for Magicbane is a quarterstaff, and it can be [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forged]] together with [[Secespita]] to create [[EvilHack#Forged Artifacts|The Staff of the Archmagi]], an artifact quarterstaff. Additionally, placing magicbane into a [[bag of holding]] has a 1 in 3 chance to cancel the bag and explode it, much like a [[wand of cancellation]].

&&%s&& %s Source diving {141525 2021-07-05T00:38:54Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Message sources */ Trim? '''Source diving''' is the action of examining the [[source code]] of [[NetHack]]. A person who practices source diving is called a '''source diver'''. The source code is freely available for anyone, unlike in most commercial programs.

Source diving is usually done when someone wants to know how something really works in the game. Source divers may also program their own [[patch]]es to the game. Some people may just want to look for easter eggs or interesting [[comments]] in the source.

[[Grep]], [[GEMA]], [[AWK]], and [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html Doxygen] are useful tools when source diving.

==Tips==
===Function definitions===
Most function declarations are in [[Source:NetHack_3.6.1/include/extern.h|extern.h]], sorted by the .c file they're defined in. If you're looking for a function's definition, you can search for the function name in extern.h, then scroll up to the comment giving the file name. Note that some things that look like functions, such as <code>resists_fire(mon)</code>, are actually preprocessor macros; most of those are defined in other header files such as [[Source:NetHack_3.6.1/include/youprop.h|youprop.h]] or [[Source:NetHack_3.6.1/include/mondata.h|mondata.h]].
===Message sources===
You can look up printed messages in the code to get an idea of what governs certain output. However, many messages are constructed using macros and/or string substitution. For example, when trying to [[riding|mount]] your steed, you may get the message: {{message|You are unable to swing your leg over.}}
You won't find this exact message anywhere in the source code, because the line that produces it reads: <code>You("are unable to swing your %s over.", body_part(LEG))</code>. The macro <code>You()</code> prints a message beginning with the word "You"; there are similar macros for messages starting with "Your", "You hear", and "You feel". The "%s" in the message is replaced with the result of the next argument, <code>body_part(LEG)</code>, which resolves to a string describing the leg-analogue of your current [[polyself]], if any. In this case, one way to search for the message would be "unable to swing your %s over". In general, if any word or words in a message can vary, replace them with %s in a search; if a number varies, replace it with %ld. (Alternatively, trim to "unable to swing your", if your search mechanism may not cooperate with %s or %ld as part of a search.)

A '''potion of fruit juice''' is a type of potion that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
[[Delicatessen]]s will sometimes sell fruit juice.

Fruit juice can also be created from other potions in the following ways:
* Dipping an [[amethyst]] into a [[potion of booze]].
* Dipping a [[unicorn horn]] into a [[potion of sickness]].
* [[Cancel]]ling a potion of sickness or {{! of|see invisible}}.

==Description==
The potion is simply juice made from the [[slime mold|nameable fruit]], and raises your [[nutrition]] when [[quaff]]ed. It adds only 10 nutrition if cursed, 20 if uncursed, and 30 if blessed. The amount of nutrition is halved if the potion is [[diluted]].{{refsrc|src/potion.c|768|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Potions of fruit juice have the same [[weight]] as [[food ration]]s, but offer a lot less nutrition per unit a weight than rations and some other [[comestible]]s; most players will be fine [[polypiling]] potions of fruit juice that they come across, diluting them into {{! of|water}} or else simply drinking them immediately. [[Foodless]] players are a major exception for obvious reasons, and also benefit in particular from alchemizing diluted fruit juice into booze.

In a game where the [[smoky potion]] is fruit juice, players may consider going for [[wish]]es by collecting potions of {{potion of|sickness|or=1|see invisible}} to turn into fruit juice via [[cancellation]].

===Identification===
The [[potion of see invisible]] uses the same [[#Messages|messages]] as fruit juice when quaffed, making it somewhat difficult to tell them apart. Some ways reliably identify fruit juice include:

* Fruit juice is the only one of the pair sold in a delicatessen; delicatessens will also only buy the fruit juice if you drop either potion on any of the shop's squares.
* Dipping a unicorn horn into a potion of sickness turns it into fruit juice.
* Fruit juice is unaffected by cancellation.
* If you have become hungry within the last few turns and that status disappears upon quaffing a potion that gives these messages, it was fruit juice.
* Fruit juice can be generated by a [[horn of plenty]].
* Dipping an amethyst into a [[potion of booze]] turns it into fruit juice; however, this typically requires you to have identified the [[gem]] first.

==Messages==
These messages use whatever the [[Options#fruit|user-specified name]] for the fruit is, which is "slime mold" by default.

{{message|This tastes like <slime mold> juice.|The potion was blessed or uncursed.}}
{{message|Yecch! This tastes rotten.|The potion was cursed.}}
{{message|This tastes like reconstituted <slime mold> juice.|The potion was diluted.}}
{{message|This tastes like 10% real <slime mold> juice all-natural beverage.|You quaffed the potion while [[hallucinating]].}}
{{message|This tastes like 10% real reconstituted <slime mold> juice all-natural beverage.|As above, and the potion was diluted.}}

A '''potion of see invisible''' is a type of [[potion]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
===Alchemy===
Potions of see invisible may be obtained through [[alchemy]], by mixing {{! of|fruit juice}} with either {{! of| gain level}} or {{! of|gain energy}}.

==Description==
{{main|See invisible}}
Quaffing a potion of see invisible confers the [[see invisible]] intrinsic, which lets you see [[invisible]] monsters, with its effects dependent on [[beatitude]]: a cursed or uncursed potions gives you the intrinsic for 750-849 turns, while a blessed one gives you the intrinsic permanently.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|778|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Non-cursed potions also cure [[blindness]].{{refsrc|src/potion.c|772|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} 

[[Cancel]]ling a potion of see invisible will turn it into a potion of fruit juice.

==Strategy==
After you have permanently obtained intrinsic see invisible (typically from a blessed potion), these potions are a prime candidate for [[dilution]]. [[Foodless]] players may want to cancel these potions to gain nutrition from the resulting fruit juice.

===Identification===
The potions of see invisible and fruit juice share [[Potion of fruit juice#Messages|exactly the same messages]] (a reference to the game [[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]). This makes them quite difficult to tell apart by random [[quaff]]ing; it is recommended to type-[[name]] both potions so that you can rename them later if one is identified. Some ways to identify a potion of see invisible include quaffing them while blind, with see invisible curing the blindness, and looking for previously invisible monsters that suddenly become visible. [[Enlightenment]] after quaffing a suspected potion will reveal if you have the intrinsic.

==Messages==
Aside from the messages shared with the potion of fruit juice, there are other messages relevant to the potion of see invisible.
{{message|You can see through yourself, but you are visible!|You quaffed the potion while invisible.}}
{{message|Gee! All of a sudden, you can see right through yourself.|You became invisible after you obtained the see invisible intrinsic.}}

&&%s&& %s Potion of oil {146777 2022-07-21T02:44:57Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Description */ {{potion|name=oil|cost=250}}

A '''potion of oil''' is a type of [[potion]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
Characters that start the game with an oil lamp will have potions of oil already identified in the discoveries section.

The lighting [[shop]] found in [[Minetown]] will occasionally have a potion of oil among its wares.

==Description==
The potion of oil has a surprisingly wide number of applications, but is primarily intended to be fuel for [[oil lamp]]s. This is done by [[dip]]ping the lamp into the potion of oil, which uses it up - if the lamp is lit and the potion is not, the potion will explode instead. [[Magic lamp]]s and oil lamps behave the same when dipped in potions of oil.

Doing anything with a [[cursed]] potion of oil may cause the oil to spill and make your fingers [[slippery fingers|slippery]].

===Dipping other objects===
Dipping a [[unicorn horn]] into a potion of oil gives the horn an "oily sheen", which identifies and uses up the potion, but has no further effects. Dipping anything into a lit potion of oil uses up the potion and will burn the dipped item(s) if possible. 

===Lighting oil===
You can light a potion of oil by [[apply]]ing it, and snuff it out by applying it again; this also auto-identifies the potion. A lit potion of oil can be [[throw]]n as an [[Explosion#Fiery explosion|explosive]] projectile, dealing 4d4 fire damage to anything caught in the explosion.

===Quaffing===
[[Quaff]]ing an unlit potion of oil only [[exercise|abuses]] your [[Wisdom]] and identifies the potion; quaffing a lit potion additionally deals 3d4 fire damage (1d4 if [[fire resistant]]). However, if you are polymorphed into a monster that likes fire (e.g., fiery monsters such as [[fire vortex|fire vortices]] and [[salamander]]s), you instead exercise wisdom and take no damage.

===Repairing weapons ===
Oil can also be used to fix [[erosion|damaged]] iron weapons; dipping a rusty or corroded weapon into a non-cursed potion of oil removes one degree of damage.

===Squeaky boards===
A potion of oil can be used to untrap a [[squeaky board]], similar to a [[can of grease]].

==Strategy==
Identifying a potion of oil is fairly easy, as it is the only potion that you can [[apply]], and randomly testing potions using this method is generally safe - however, doing this with a potion owned by a shop will result in you being charged a [[Yendorian Fuel Tax]] along with the price for that potion.

The [[scroll of fire]], [[spellbook of fireball]] and other [[fireproof]]ed items can potentially be identified by dipping into a lit potion of oil, but this method is ultimately a waste of a potion (as well as likely wasting whatever you tested with it) and is not recommended. 

A lit potion of oil can be used to cure [[sliming]] if thrown upward; quaffing a lit potion of oil does '''not''' cure sliming.

Potions of oil are useful for repairing weapons, since eroded weapons can only otherwise be repaired by reading a [[scroll of enchant weapon]] while [[confused]], or else a [[favor]] from your god.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], it was possible to indirectly identify the potion without actually applying it (and therefore avoiding payment in shops) by dropping everything else that could be applied, then hitting {{kbd|a}}. If the potion was a potion of oil, the player was asked what they wanted to apply; otherwise, they would be told they have nothing that can be applied. As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the applying prompt always appears as long as the player has at least one potion in their inventory, regardless of whether it can be applied or not.

==Messages==
{{message|Ahh, a refreshing drink.|You drank a lit potion of oil, and you are polymorphed into a monster that likes fire.}}
{{message|That was smooth!|You drank a non-cursed potion of oil.}}
{{message|This tastes like castor oil.|You drank a cursed potion of oil.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], it is possible to disarm a fire trap with a non-cursed [[potion of water]], similar to using a potion of oil on a squeaky board; this will also generate 1&ndash;4 potions of oil based on your [[Luck]]. Since oil can then be diluted back to water, the large number of fire traps in Gehennom offer an effective way of multiplying one's water potions.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], intelligent monsters can light potions of oil to throw at you.

&&%s&& %s Conduct {150129 2023-03-07T14:30:21Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} cap In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''conducts''' are various limitations that players may set on themselves to make a given game more challenging. The game keeps track of your conducts during play, and shows them at the end of a game; you may see them at any time by using the [[extended command]] '''#conduct'''. The [[Guidebook]] goes into detail on conducts in its eighth chapter.

Conducts only apply to actions taken in-game - i.e. a [[Priest]] "should" believe in a god but does not automatically lose atheist conduct, and classes that begin the game with learned [[spell]]s can play illiterate.

==Official conducts==
The "official" conducts are the conducts that the game tracks.

When you start the game, the list of conducts looks as follows:

 Voluntary challenges:
 
 You have gone without food.
 You have been an atheist.
 You have never hit with a wielded weapon.
 You have been a pacifist.
 You have been illiterate.
 You have never genocided any monsters.
 You have never polymorphed an object.
 You have never changed form.
 You have used no wishes.

If you have configured your [[options]] to attempt the zen or nudist conducts, the following additional lines appear at the top of the list:

 You have been blind from birth.
 You have been faithfully nudist.

Certain conducts (vegan, vegetarian, and artifact wishless) must be fulfilled if you have followed other conducts (for example, being foodless implies that you have been vegetarian). The game does not show these conducts as long as you are still following the stricter version.

===Foodless===

{{main|Foodless}}

[[Foodless]] means not eating anything at all. This includes sucking brains when polymorphed into a [[mind flayer]], or digesting monsters when polymorphed into a monster with a digest attack.

===Vegan===

Vegans refrain from eating anything which comes from an animal. Vegans may eat:

* food rations, cram rations, K-rations, C-rations and lembas wafers
* melons, oranges, carrots, pears, apples, bananas, kelp, eucalyptus, garlic, wolfsbane, and user-defined fruit
* corpses and tins of any monster represented by {{mcsl|b}}, {{mcsl|j}}, or {{mcsl|F}}
* tins of spinach

The ''only'' corpses from which a vegan may gain an intrinsic resistance (% chance when eaten) are:
* {{monsymlink|gelatinous cube}} (fire 10%, cold 10%, shock 10%, sleep 10%)
* {{monsymlink|quivering blob}} (poison 33%)
* {{monsymlink|blue jelly}} (cold 13%, poison 13%)
* {{monsymlink|shrieker}} (poison 20%)
* {{monsymlink|red mold}} (fire 3%, poison 3%)
* {{monsymlink|brown mold}} (cold 3%, poison 3%)
* With caution: {{monsymlink|violet fungus}} (poison 20%)&mdash;but causes [[hallucination]]
* With extreme caution: {{monsymlink|yellow mold}} (poison 7%)&mdash;but is [[poison]]ous to eat and causes [[hallucination]]

When [[polyself|polymorphed]] into something with a [[digest]] attack, vegans may consume monsters that leave vegan corpses, as well as [[corpseless]] monsters such as ghosts and yellow lights, which are hardly even food. Additionally, polymorphed vegans may [[eating jewelry|eat jewelry]] and other normally inedible metallic (as a [[metallivore]]) and organic (as a [[gelatinous cube]]) items, with the exception of [[leather]] items which would break both vegan and vegetarian conducts.

===Vegetarian===

Vegetarians may, on top of vegan foods, eat:

* [[egg]]s, [[pancake]]s, [[fortune cookie]]s, [[candy bar]]s, [[royal jelly]] and [[cream pie]]s
* wax [[candle]]s (but not tallow candles)
* [[glob]]s of [[gray ooze]], [[brown pudding]], and [[green slime]] (but note that green slime causes [[sliming]])

All other comestibles break the conduct.

All of the food restriction conducts make it much harder to gain [[intrinsic]]s, as the main source of intrinsics is eating [[corpses]]. When paired with other conducts such as polyselfless and/or atheist, it can make gaining some intrinsics impossible.

===Atheist===

{{main|Atheist}}

An atheist hero is not involved with [[religion]] in most ways.

===Pacifist===

{{main|Pacifist}}

A pacifist is a player who does not directly kill any monster. A pacifist may, however, use a wielded weapon if they take care not to kill the victim.

===Never hit with a wielded weapon===

{{main|Never hit with a wielded weapon}}

This is mostly self-explanatory. Throwing weapons, [[firing]] missiles and using wands is allowed. Hitting with other objects than weapons does not break this conduct. Thus you may very well use a [[cockatrice]] corpse as a weapon should you acquire one. [[Pick-axe]]s, [[unicorn horn]]s, and [[grappling hook]]s, however, do count as weapons, even though they are shown in the tool-category. Applying a [[bullwhip]] only breaks conduct if the target is not wielding a weapon. When trying to maintain a weaponless conduct, one should be very careful when wielding a pick-axe for digging.

===Illiterate===

{{main|Illiterate}}

Being illiterate means that you do not read or write anything - this includes [[scroll]]s, [[spellbook]]s and even [[fortune cookie]] messages and [[t-shirt]]s. Using a [[magic marker]] to write a scroll or spellbook, or engraving anything but an ''X'' or ''x'', also breaks this conduct. A [[scroll of mail]] (e.g. from users viewing your game on [[public server]]s) will warn you before you read it if the conduct is intact. Reading random engravings you may encounter on the floor does not break this conduct.

===Never polymorph an object===

"Polyless" conduct means never causing an object to be polymorphed via spell, wand, or potion of polymorph. Polymorphing monsters does not break this conduct. You don't need to worry about polymorphing previously carried items dropped by the monster as a result of polymorphing; they will not be polymorphed.{{refsrc|zap.c|1799|nethack=3.6.1}} However, there may be objects on the floor below the monster which you cannot see.

This conduct is comparatively easy: 42.3% of all winning accounts on [[NAO]] have a polypile-less ascension.

===Never change form===

"Polyselfless" conduct means never changing into another monster, including from [[lycanthropy]]. Turning into a pile of gold/orange by eating a [[mimic]] corpse also counts as of [[NetHack 3.6.0]] or later. Becoming a new man/woman/orc/etc does not count as changing.  (In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], eating a mimic corpse did not break this conduct.)

This conduct is easy to break inadvertently by wandering into an unknown polytrap.  Nevertheless, it is relatively easy: 73.5% of all winning accounts on [[NAO]] achieve it.

===Genocideless===
Genocideless conduct is pretty obvious; refrain from causing [[genocide]]. Reverse genocide does not break this conduct. (You may not kill a [[mail daemon]], either.)

Fully 33.1% of all winning accounts on [[NAO]] achieve this conduct at least once.

===Wishless, artifact wishless===
{{anchor|Wishless}}

{{main|Wishless}}

Two [[wish]]ing-related conducts are tracked: wishing for anything and wishing for [[artifact]]s. If you wish for, say, a [[silver dragon scale mail]], you still have the artifact-wishless conduct. However, if you wish for any artifact, you lose both conducts, regardless of whether you actually receive the artifact.

===Zen===
{{main|Zen}}

The zen conduct is being [[blind]] throughout the entire game. It is one of the most difficult conducts, and only a [[Zen#Notable_ascensions|handful of people]] are known to have ascended zen games. In order for this conduct to be tracked in your game, you must edit your [[configuration file]] to enable the [[Options#blind|blind option]].

The difficulty in zen comes in that it is like a mixture of other conducts with additional twists to make it even harder. Reading is impossible (though there are ways to make scrolls readable, and the [[Book of the Dead]] can be read when blind). You cannot use [[altar]]s to find the [[beatitude]] of objects because you cannot see any flash. You also do not see what your objects look like by their material or color, so all potions are only shown as "a potion", wands as "a wand" and so on.

===Nudist===
Nudism means not wearing any armor throughout the game. Accessories like rings, amulets, lenses and blindfolds are permitted. Beginning the game with armor will automatically break the conduct, so in order to prevent this, turn on the [[Options#nudist|nudist option]] in your configuration file.

Some success stories: [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/eb4092c6699658e6/067ff8f3846db66b#067ff8f3846db66b Solidsnail], [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/944241c8699561d9/336aca80d29b6db1#336aca80d29b6db1 Ron Copeland].

==Unofficial conducts==
{{main|Unofficial conduct}}
Unofficial conducts are conducts that are not tracked by the vanilla version of the game. They are enforced by the players themselves only.

==History==

The [[Options#blind|blind option]] and [[Options#nudist|nudist option]] were added in [[NetHack 3.6.0]]. Prior to 3.6.0, the zen and nudist conducts were unofficial but supported by certain variants.

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], eating a mimic corpse did not break the "polyselfless" conduct.

===Candle considerations===
When playing versions prior to [[3.6.0]], it is theoretically possible to explore the entire dungeon, and not come across seven [[candle]]s.  [[Izchak]]'s lighting shop is guaranteed, but it is not guaranteed to have enough of them.  If you have explored all branches of the dungeon and still not enough have been generated, you will have to obtain the remainder through one of the following means:

* Wishing for them: violates wishless conduct
* Polymorphing tools: violates polypileless conduct
* [[Death drop]]s: violates pacifist conduct

In effect, a lack of candles can make a game [[unwinnable]] without violating one of these three conducts.

This problem is solved by several variants. [[AceHack]] and [[NetHack 4]] allow for [[gnome]]s to death-drop candles even if killed using a pet (and thus, spare candles are obtainable without breaking pacifist conduct); likewise, [[wax golem]]s drop candles no matter how they die, in the variants in which they exist. [[GruntHack]] guarantees at least seven candles in the lighting shop. [[UnNetHack]] includes wax golems and sometimes generates gnomes with candles in their inventory. 

[[NetHack 3.6.0]] guarantees at least 8 candles at [[Vlad's Tower]].  [[Gnome (monster class)|Gnomes]] have a small chance of being generated with a candle, as well.

&&%s&& %s Telepathy {149524 2022-12-22T17:15:53Z {4001479 Hexcoder} /* Sources */ the the -> the [[Image:Telepathy vs warning.png|300px|right|thumb|The range of unblind extrinsic telepathy is indicated by flags. In comparison, the range of [[warning]] is slightly greater, and is indicated by question marks.]]

'''Telepathy''' is a passive ability that allows [[player]]s and [[monster]]s to detect non-[[mindless]] creatures, regardless of whether or not they can be seen visually. Telepathy comes in two types: the less powerful '''intrinsic telepathy''' and the more powerful '''extrinsic telepathy'''.

[[Intrinsic]] telepathy only works when you are [[blind]], and detects all non-[[mindless]] creatures on the level. [[Extrinsic]] telepathy does the same thing as intrinsic telepathy, but additionally works to a lesser degree while unblind, to a maximum range of 8 squares.{{refsrc|display.h|33}}{{refsrc|hack.h|21}} Because intrinsic telepathy is typically acquired before extrinsic telepathy, some players mistakenly think extrinsic telepathy does not show the whole level while blind.

== Sources ==
Intrinsic telepathy can be acquired through the following methods:

* Eating the corpse of a [[floating eye]] (100% chance) or a [[mind flayer|(master) mind flayer]] (50%)
* [[Eating jewelry|Eating]] an [[amulet of ESP]]
* [[Polymorph]]ing into a monster with telepathy (i.e. a floating eye or mind flayer)
* [[Praying]] to your god under certain circumstances

Intrinsic telepathy can be lost through the [[gremlin]]'s intrinsic-stealing attack at night, or else by committing [[murder]] as a [[lawful]] or [[neutral]] character.

Extrinsic telepathy can be acquired by:

* Wearing an amulet of ESP, including [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]], or a [[helm of telepathy]]
* Carrying any of the following [[artifact]]s:
** [[The Longbow of Diana]]
** [[The Orb of Detection]]
** [[The Magic Mirror of Merlin]]
** [[The Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]

It is possible to have both intrinsic and extrinsic telepathy simultaneously; in this case, the more powerful extrinsic telepathy takes priority.

==Strategy==
Intrinsic telepathy can be a useful substitute for other methods of [[monster detection]], although it cannot be used to spot mindless monsters; over-reliance on intrinsic telepathy to detect danger while blind may result in something such as a [[golem]] sneaking up on an unsuspecting player. Using a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]] to blind and unblind yourself at will, as well as using an item such as a [[unicorn horn]] to cure any other sight impairments (e.g., exploding [[yellow light]]s) can mitigate the worst of this.

Possessing telepathy allows [[mind flayer]]s to detect your location and hit you with a long-distance psionic attack for d15 damage. You can counteract this by temporarily removing or stashing your source of telepathy if it is extrinsic, but the damage is usually negligible outside of some early scenarios, possibly involving [[minesflayer]]s; in any case, be prepared to deal with the mind flayer in question (see their article for more information).

==Messages==
{{message|You feel a strange mental acuity.|You gained intrinsic telepathy from eating a corpse.}}
{{message|You feel in touch with the cosmos.|As above while [[hallucinating]].}}

The '''watchman''' and '''watch captain''' are monsters that appear in ''[[NetHack]]'', and are most commonly seen as the peace-keeping [[Minetown]] '''watch'''. If you #[[chat]] with a peaceful watchman, they will complain about their jobs.

==Generation==
{{main|Mercenaries}}
Watchmen and watch captains are not randomly generated, instead appearing in set locations. Several watchmen and at least one watch captain will be generated in any version of Minetown, with the exception of Orcish Town (where only their corpses will be found); the Bustling Town variant will have two watch captains. Two watchmen will also be generated in the anterooms of the [[Archaeologist quest]] home level; two watchmen also sit outside the gates of the [[Tourist quest]] home level, and a third watchman can be found in the goal level. A watchman can [[grow up]] into a watch captain.

The watch is always generated peaceful. As they are considered [[mercenaries]], they follow the special rules for [[monster starting inventory]] detailed in that article.

==Angering the watch==
While watchmen are always generated peaceful, they can become hostile through a number of [[player]] actions. All watchmen and watch captains on the current level will become hostile and try to kill you if you perform any of the following actions: 

* Directly attacking a peaceful watchman, unless the attack kills them in a single hit.
* Directly attacking a peaceful [[shopkeeper]] or stealing from [[shop]]s.
* Attacking any peaceful monster in sight of the watchman.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2725|NetHack=3.6.1}}
* Attacking the [[aligned priest|priest]].
* Cutting down or kicking [[tree]]s.
* Destroying or drying up [[fountain]]s.
* [[Dig]]ging through [[wall]]s and razing [[door]]s with a [[wand of digging|wand]] or [[spell of dig]]ging.
* Kicking down doors.
* Improvising with a [[bugle]]; as watchmen are mercenaries, this will anger them and any other soldiers present on the level.

The following actions will be interrupted if a watchman sees you, and will result in a warning (with some exceptions), followed by them turning hostile if you continue:

* Digging through walls or doors with a [[pick-axe]].
* Dipping into or quaffing from a fountain; this is also signaled by the fountain's flow "reducing to a trickle", even if a watchman is not in sight.
** However, if you dip for [[Excalibur]] and successfully receive it, the fountain will dry up without warning, and the watch will become hostile whether or not they are in sight.
* Spending multiple turns locking or unlocking doors; however, the watch will not object if the action takes one turn, which is more likely to happen with a skeleton key for non-Rogues. Getting warned will also cause the door to become trapped.
** This is because NetHack stores the data "the player has been warned about this door" and "this door is booby trapped" in the same piece of memory; the developers made some notes in the code regarding the problem.{{refsrc|include/rm.h|352|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}{{refsrc|include/rm.h|320|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}
** Note that attempting to unlock the door again ''immediately'' after will cause them to turn hostile, and unlocking a trapped door will give no warning. However, attempting to #[[untrap]] the door instead will not turn the watch hostile even if your attempt sets it off and destroys the door; the watchmen will only check for immediate attempts to pick the lock. 

Breaking doors, chopping down trees, and digging through non-shop walls will not anger a watchman if they do not directly witness the act; drying up fountains and attacking priests and shopkeepers will still anger the watch, regardless of whether they are in sight.

==Strategy==
While antagonizing the watch is neither necessary nor recommended, there are cases where a player may want to prevent accidentally angering them, or else find a way to snag any desirable items they hold without risking their alignment. Avoiding conflict with the watch can also be difficult while fighting other monsters - a misaimed [[dagger]], stray [[wand]] shot, or being [[stunned]] by a [[gnomish wizard]] can easily land you in serious hot water.

===Getting the watch out of your way===
If the watchmen are constantly getting in your way, or else simply stand between you and something you plan to try, there are several relatively safe means to get them out of your hair:

* Buy a key from a Minetown shop (if you don't already have one) and use it to lock the watchmen inside some of the empty rooms. They won't see you locking it from inside the door, so as long as there are no other watchmen in sight, this is fairly safe.
* Lure the watchmen to other levels by having them follow you to an up or down stair. If they are adjacent to you when you use the stairs, they will follow you to the next level, where you can shake them off and return to Minetown.
* Get a pet to kill them. A [[large cat]] or [[large dog]] can kill watchmen fairly easily, and a [[horse]] or warhorse even more so. Watch captains are more dangerous, but can still be beaten if you assist the pet with healing spells.

===Pacifying the watch===
If you anger a watchman, you can use a [[scroll of taming]] or [[spell of charm monster]], which will pacify watchmen reliably due to their low [[monster magic resistance]]; this is especially useful if multiple watchmen are after you. As a low-level character, you are probably best off running and coming back later once you can fight them or have a means of pacifying them. Be mindful that [[bribing]] watchmen will always fail to pacify them.

If you can manage it, stealing any (preferably inexpensive) item from a shop and then pacifying the shopkeeper will also pacify any watchmen, regardless of your original offenses.

===Fighting watchmen===
Watchmen and watch captains are slightly slower than an unburdened player at normal speed, and share similar movement patterns between each other. Watch captains have a higher base level, hit roughly three times as hard, and generally have much better AC, armor and weapons than a standard watchman. The rank-and-file watchmen are relatively easy to kill unless you are low-level, and their inventory is likely to have good filler items such as [[gloves]] to complete a set of armor. The watch captains are much harder to kill, and have a 50% chance each of carrying a [[silver saber]] or a [[long sword]].

As previously mentioned, if playing a low-level character that has angered the watch, the best thing to do is to run away from Minetown and come back later. If you are fighting off a group of watchmen, the stairs can be used to your advantage - they will pursue you if adjacent, which can be used to isolate them from the others and deal with them one by one. It is also wise to avoid doing anything that will anger all the watchmen and have them surround you.

Pets will often go after the watchmen upon gaining enough levels, and can be used to dispatch them without risking any penalties; however, the watch captain is likely to take out even a high-leveled domestic pet unless they are healed regularly or else [[polymorph]]ed into a better form (e.g., any [[major demon]] or [[dragon]]). A [[leash]] and/or [[magic whistle]] is recommended if you wish to stop your lower-leveled pet from constantly attacking watchmen and risking their life. Alternately, said pets can also be used to kill off the watchmen and procure their armor and weapons without any risk to yourself or your alignment/[[Luck]].

===Sacrifice===
Directly killing watchmen to sacrifice them is not recommended, even if you are a chaotic non-human - angering and killing them results in a huge alignment hit, independent of any additional penalties for [[murder]]. Early in the game, when you typically reach Minetown, your [[alignment record]] cap is low; even without murder penalties, your alignment will take enough of a hit that recovery can be long and tedious at absolute best. It is best to let your pet (particularly a non-carnivorous one) handle the job in these cases; if you are chaotic and lack a pet, but are still intent on sacrificing watchmen, it is wise to follow those up with other sacrifices to ensure your alignment is positive afterward, and confirm it through means such as a [[stethoscope]].

==History==
Watchmen were introduced in [[NetHack 3.1.0]], along with the branches of the dungeon they appear in.

==Messages==
{{message|"My feet hurt, I've been on them all day!"<br>"The food's not fit for Orcs!"<br>"What lousy pay we're getting here!"|You chatted to a peaceful watchman or watch captain.}}
{{message|"Hey, stop picking that lock!"|A watchman saw you taking more than one turn to pick a lock and interrupted you with a warning.}}
{{message|"Halt! You are under arrest!"|You have angered one or more watchmen, and they have turned hostile.}}

==Variants==
===Convict patch===
In the [[Convict]] role patch and variants that incorporate, watchmen will immediately turn hostile and attack a player Convict on sight.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the [[Mall]] has four watchmen and three watch captains in the area.

The home level of the [[Yeoman]] [[Yeoman quest|quest branch]] also has three watch captains and four watchmen, as well as a watchman corpse named [[wikipedia:Thomas Blood#Theft of the Crown Jewels|Talbot Edwards]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], the [[Town]] branch also has its own watch patrolling the area.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the watch is now composed of various [[racial monster]]s, as with all mercenaries.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], the watch captain will always have a key, allowing them to open any locked door.

&&%s&& %s Cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor {131791 2020-02-02T20:39:15Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{amulet

}}
The '''cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor''' ('''CPIoAoY''') is an [[amulet]] that exists in ''[[NetHack]]''. It appears as the "Amulet of Yendor" when unidentified.

==Generation==
It has a 50% chance of being generated on the [[Rogue level]]{{refsrc|extralev.c|362|nethack=3.6.2}} (this one will be pre-identified as a fake) and a 50% chance of being in the inventory of a [[Double Trouble|double-troubled]] [[Wizard of Yendor]] when you don't have the amulet (with a 0% chance when you do).{{refsrc|wizard.c|499|nethack=3.6.2}} Player monsters on the [[Astral Plane]] all carry one,{{refsrc|mplayer.c|149|nethack=3.6.2}} which is presumably why they're stuck there.

Wishing for the Amulet of Yendor gives you a plastic imitation instead (unless you are in [[wizard mode]]). If the real Amulet is left in a [[bones]] file, it gets converted to a [[cursed]] fake amulet.{{refsrc|bones.c|163|nethack=3.6.2}}

==Effects==
It has no effect when worn, and exists solely to be confused with the real [[Amulet of Yendor]]. Offering one of these on a [[high altar]] carries a penalty of -1 [[luck]]. However, if the amulet was ''identified'' as a fake, the penalty is instead -3 luck, -1 [[Alignment record|alignment]] and your god getting [[Anger|angry]] by 3.{{refsrc|pray.c|1560|nethack=3.6.2}}

==Strategy==
It can be considered one of the most useless items, next to [[iron chain]]s. However, it ''can'' be [[polymorph]]ed into a more useful amulet.

===Identification===
Every plastic imitation besides the one on the [[Rogue level]] must be individually [[Identify|identified]] to distinguish it from the real Amulet of Yendor; the cheap plastic imitation can also be distinguished from the real Amulet of Yendor by trying to put it into a [[container]], as the real Amulet will resist.
