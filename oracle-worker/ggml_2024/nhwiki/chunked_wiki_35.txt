Most artifacts have an alignment. If the artifact is not intelligent, then you have only a {{frac|4}} chance of being [[Artifact blast|blasted]] if you have a different alignment from the artifact or have a negative alignment record, or are in the form of something the artifact specially attacks; damage is 4d4 (2d4 if you have magic resistance). If you have enough [[HP]] to survive the blast, you will be able to use the artifact.

[[Intelligent artifact]]s can emit much stronger blasts; they might also "evade your grasp", meaning that you are unable to use them.

==Dungeon alignment==

[[Branch]]es of the dungeon can be aligned in the sense that monster generation in that branch is biased toward monsters of that alignment due to adjusted [[monster frequency]].{{refsrc|dat/dungeon.def|17|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

*[[Gnomish Mines]]: lawful
*[[Oracle]]: neutral
*[[Sokoban]]: neutral
*[[Medusa's Island]]: chaotic
*[[Vlad's Tower]]: chaotic
*All other levels: unaligned (no particular alignment bias)

==Origin==

The three alignments of ''[[NetHack]]'' probably originate from the first edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. ''D&D'' gods have a specific alignment, and their worshipers are also of that alignment. Later ''D&D'' editions include a second axis of alignment: good, neutral, or evil. This results in nine combinations, such as "chaotic good" or "true neutral".

Before ''D&D'' introduced the good&ndash;evil axis, some players had equated "lawful" with "good" and "chaotic" with "evil"; games like ''[[ADOM]]'' follow this idea. Perhaps this is why ''D&D'' added the second axis. Many computer games, like ''NetHack'', did not include this complication.

Unlike ''D&D'', which has numerous plots, ''NetHack'' always follows the same story of taking that [[Amulet of Yendor]] from Moloch. Thus, in ''NetHack'', alignments can be compared by how they relate to that story.

For a lawful character, think ''law and order''. Perhaps the surface world has evil Knights and Samurai supporting tyrannical empires, but it is hard to believe that our [[Knight]] or [[Samurai]] seeking the Amulet is anything but good. They avoid murder and shoplifting, the Knight keeps a code of conduct, and the Samurai maintains honor. Perhaps other lawful roles need not act so good.

A neutral character does not much care about alignment. Most of the special effects of alignment are for lawful or chaotic characters. The neutral character just wants to obtain the best artifacts and win [[immortality]]. He or she might be planning from the start to take a [[helm of opposite alignment]] to the [[Astral Plane]] and just [[offer]] the Amulet to the closest high altar.

A chaotic character aims for convenience and cares not for order. In contrast to the lawful characters' like of social settings and orderly group activity, chaotic characters prefer individual action and are perhaps most suited to a one-player game like ''NetHack''. Chaotic characters can keep [[pet]]s as well as lawful and neutral characters can, before they take out [[Stormbringer]].

Every [[elf (starting race)|elf]] is chaotic. ''NetHack''&#39;s elves may be the size of humans, but they are not of Tolkien. Of elves, the [https://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.spod-central.org/%257Epsmith/nh/rgrn-FAQ.txt rec.games.roguelike.nethack FAQ] says that "there's hundreds of years of tradition of the land of Faerie being one where human concepts of law simply do not apply." This quote makes elves worshipping human gods even more absurd than it already was.

[[Demon]]s would seem to be a special case. They are evil almost by definition, and yet both lawful and chaotic (but not neutral) variants exist. If you polymorph into a demon, no matter what its alignment, you will be damaged by holy water and healed by unholy water, and be unable to pray to any but a chaotic god. It appears that for demons, "lawful" is equivalent to the ''D&D'' alignment "lawful evil", and "chaotic" to "chaotic evil", instead of the good&ndash;evil axis that describes players and other monsters. ''D&D'' divides its fiends into lawful evil "devils" and chaotic evil "demons", but ''NetHack'' makes no such distinction.

"Unaligned" implies that Moloch and his followers subscribe to some alien morality completely removed from the lawful-neutral-chaotic trichotomy. However, a reference in the source (unused in vanilla NetHack) lists the guiding principle of unaligned as "evil"{{refsrc|src/role.c|765|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}. If taken as canon, this means that chaotic and evil are indeed distinct from each other. This would explain why actions such as abusing [[Elbereth]] and killing your [[pet]] are frowned upon by even chaotic gods.

==SLASH'EM==

In [[SLASH'EM]], lawful characters get much more powerful minions than others, and they can get minions by praying with low HP as well as sacrifice. However, lawful characters will anger their god if they drink a [[potion of vampire blood]].

Elves are always lawful or neutral. There are also five new races in SLASH'EM; their alignments are as follows:
*Drow: chaotic
*Doppelganger: neutral or chaotic
*Hobbit: lawful or neutral
*Lycanthrope: chaotic
*Vampire: chaotic

There are also many more special levels and dungeon branches in SLASH'EM. Their alignments are as follows:

*Gnomish Mines: lawful
*Mall: lawful
*Oracle: neutral
*Sokoban: neutral
*Grund's Stronghold: chaotic
*Lawful Quest: lawful
*Neutral Quest: neutral
*Chaotic Quest: chaotic
*Wyrm Caves: chaotic
*Black Market: chaotic
*Lost Tomb: chaotic
*Spider Caves: chaotic
*Sunless Sea: chaotic
*Temple of Moloch: chaotic
*Giant Caverns: chaotic
*Medusa: chaotic
*Vlad's Tower: chaotic
*Frankenstein's Lab: chaotic
*All others: unaligned

'''Baalzebub''', {{monsym|baalzebub}}, is a [[demon prince]] who appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. He is guaranteed to appear in [[Gehennom]], and is generally encountered after [[Asmodeus]].

==Generation==
Under normal circumstances, Baalzebub will be encountered [[Baalzebub's Lair|in his lair]], situated in a passage at the very back next to the stairs. The lair is eligible to leave [[bones]].

==Strategy==
As with Asmodeus before him, Baalzebub will appear before you once you attract his attention; if you were not wielding [[Excalibur]] upon entering the lair, he will start out peaceful and demand a portion of your visible [[gold]] as [[Bribe|payment for safe passage]]. If you were wielding Excalibur at the time of level creation, refuse the bribe when he asks, or else he fails to see where you are, Baalzebub will become hostile.{{refsrc|monmove.c|384}}{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|469|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1329|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/minion.c|230|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Giving Baalzebub the desired gold will cause him to disappear from the level, allowing you to continue forward; this is the ideal strategy if you are [[Speed ascension|in a hurry]] or else want to conserve resources. As always, unwield Excalibur or Demonbane before walking down to his lair if you plan to pay him off.

Baalzebub is quite easy to defeat, especially compared to Asmodeus; while he is almost as [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic-resistant]], Baalzebub's primary methods of attack are his poisonous sting and stunning [[gaze attack]], which can be easily countered. [[Blindfold]]ing yourself protects from his somewhat annoying gaze, and most players will have poison resistance by the time they encounter him, or else have other ways to render [[strength]] loss a non-issue. Fighting him on the up staircase with your best weapons is usually enough.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|[[Demonbane]] will now have the same effect as Excalibur on Baalzebub and other princes when wielded.}}

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Beelzebub}}
Like the other demon rulers, Baalzebub is adapted from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which uses the spelling '''Baalzebul''' and is in turn inspired by Christian demonology.

Beelzebub was originally the name of a Philistine god formerly worshipped in Ekron, whose name was associated with the Canaanite god Baal; he was later adopted by some Abrahamic religions as a major demon. Baalzebub is known in Christian demonology as one of the seven princes of Hell; in some predominantly-Christian theological sources, Beelzebub is another name for Satan. The Dictionnaire Infernal describes Beelzebub as a being capable of [[flying]], known as the "Lord of the Flyers", or the "Lord of the Flies". This is considered to be the result of mistranslating of the Hebrew ''Ba'alzevuv'' (Greek ''Beelzebub''), and as the encyclopedia entry hints, the name may have been mis-transliterated in turn.

In ''Dungeons & Dragons'', Baalzebul appears as a giant slug-like creature which trails feces and garbage wherever he goes. Flies crawl over his body at all times, and his arms are tiny and malformed. He also has a dark-skinned humanoid form with compound insect eyes, which is said to be his initial form prior to being transformed as a punishment by Asmodeus. Other media generally depicts Beelzebub as a demonic fly; in ''NetHack'', this is reflected by both his default tile as well as the fly-like shape of his lair. The encyclopedia entry comes from the novel ''[[wikipedia:Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Flies]]'', named for Baalzebub.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
The "lord of the flies" is a translation of the Hebrew Ba'alzevuv (Beelzebub in Greek).  It has been suggested that it was a mistranslation of a mistransliterated word which gave us this pungent and suggestive name of the Devil, a devil whose name suggests that he is devoted to decay, destruction, demoralization, hysteria and panic...

'''Dispater''', {{monsym|dispater}}, is one of the many [[demon prince]]s that can appear in ''[[NetHack]]''. Like all demon princes and lords, he is [[covetous]] and capable of [[flying]], and will attempt to steal the [[Amulet of Yendor]] if you possess it.

Dispater is one of three demon princes without his own lair in [[Gehennom]], with the other two being [[Geryon]] and [[Demogorgon]]. He has the fourth-highest [[monster difficulty]] and [[experience point]] yield in the game behind [[Baalzebub]].

==Generation==
Under normal circumstances, Dispater will only appear if summoned via the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]] being cast in Gehennom, or being gated in by another demon prince (e.g., [[Asmodeus]], [[Baalzebub]] or Geryon). It is also possible for him to appear in a [[bones]] file.

Dispater is [[Monster starting inventory|always generated with]] a [[wand of striking]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|499|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Like other [[lawful]] demon princes, Dispater can be [[bribe]]d for safe passage with a portion of your visible [[gold]]. If you were wielding [[Excalibur]] at the time of his appearance, refuse when he asks, or else he fails to see where you are, Dispater will become hostile.{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|469|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1329|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/minion.c|230|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Dispater is a rather dangerous spellcaster in spite of his relatively poor [[AC]] (surpassed by [[water demon]]s and [[horned devil]]s). He has a lot of [[hit point]]s, great [[magic resistance (monster)|monster magic resistance]], and can move almost as quickly as a [[fast]] player. In addition to the standard demon prince traits of [[fire resistance|fire]] and [[poison resistance]], he has a decently strong weapon attack and powerful mage spells—up to and including [[curse items]], summon nasties, and the [[touch of death]]. However, he will always use his wand of striking first, which should be no danger to any player at that point.

With that in mind, even if you possess [[magic resistance]], it is still best to kill Dispater as quickly as possible if he appears—his magic is far more annoying to contend with once his wand is spent; beware using shock damage against him, as it may prematurely destroy his wand. Players going for [[speed ascension]]s should bribe Asmodeus and Baalzebub or else deal with them quickly before he can be gated, although it is still possible for the [[Wizard of Yendor]] to summon him if he gets a chance.

Some [[extinctionist]] players may want to have a hasted Asmodeus or Baalzebub gate him in if they plan to eradicate all unique monsters.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Per [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/2288452278ecc1ba7a12fe66f775cd4d7b759f34 this commit] monsters will remember players resistances and reflection and adjust their attacks accordingly - thus, if Dispater sees that his wand of striking is rendered ineffective by your magic resistance, he will stop using it and become a nuisance far quicker than he would otherwise.}}

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Dīs Pater}}
The ''NetHack'' incarnation of Dispater is based on his portrayal in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' source books, where he is a unique archdevil—this is in turn based on Dīs Pater, a Roman god of the underworld later subsumed by Pluto or the Greek Hades. Originally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land, and underground mineral wealth, he was later commonly equated with the Roman underworld deities Pluto and [[Orcus]].

In ''Dungeons & Dragons'', Dispater's appearance is that of a handsome human about 2 meters (ca. 7 feet) tall, with two small horns, a tail and a cloven left hoof—Dispater's portrayal and [[tileset|default tile]] in ''NetHack'' draws from this, although it retains only the former trait.{{refsrc|monst.c|2708|comment=Dispater has size <code>MZ_HUMAN</code>}}{{reffunc|mondata.c|num_horns}}{{reffunc|polyself.c|mbodypart|comment=Dispater does not have a hoof}} He is also known to carry a powerful rod that symbolizes his authority, and also acts as a staff of striking—which is why he always generates with a wand of striking.

The "City of Dis" mentioned in the encyclopedia entry is derived from Dispater's appearance in the ''Inferno'', where the infernal city under his rule made up the entire sixth circle of Hell. Some [[variant]]s of ''NetHack'' add a lair inspired by the City.

==History==
Dispater was introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
Many [[variant]]s give Dispater his own lair in Gehennom.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], all [[demon prince]]s have lairs. [[Dispater's lair (SLASH'EM)|Dispater's lair]] is located between levels 10 and 15 of [[Gehennom]], and Dispater himself waits near the center of the long winding hallway contained within the maze. Since wands in SLASH'EM start with more charges, it will take him longer to exhaust his wand of striking, giving the player more time to kill him before he starts casting spells.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Dispater occupies a [[throne]] in the center of the citadel of Dis, and is a far tougher opponent with a much higher AC that favors the curse items and [[stoning|turn to stone]] monster spells while being immune to stoning himself. He also possess a corrosive touch attack and an armor-rusting passive, and his [[artifact weapon]], [[the Rod of Dis]], adds +1d8 damage to his attacks and can [[stun]] the player.

Dispater should not be confronted without several lizard corpses in open inventory, as characters that  begin to stiffen have only a few turns to eat one before becoming a statue—[[free action]] can buy players an additional 3 turns to act.

===Lethe patch===
In the [[Lethe patch]], Dispater has his own lair, and sits on a throne at the eastern end of the level, past a river of Lethe water.

==Encyclopaedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The Roman ruler of the underworld and fortune, similar to the Greek Hades.  Every hundred years, the Ludi Tarentini were celebrated in his honor.  The Gauls regarded Dis Pater as their ancestor.  The name is a contraction of the Latin Dives, "the wealthy", Dives Pater, "the wealthy father", or "Fater Wealth".  It refers to the wealth of precious stone below the earth.

The term '''[[foo]]cubus''' refers to an '''incubus''' or a '''succubus''', especially one of the opposite sex of the character. Foocubi are [[demon]]s that appear in ''[[NetHack]]'', and have a special '''seduction attack'''<ref>{{function|mhitu.c|doseduce}}</ref> which can be used by high-[[intelligence]] and high-[[charisma]] players for its beneficial effects, although it is not without its risks.

In the vanilla game, all foocubi are heterosexual; an incubus will never try to seduce a male character, and a succubus will never seduce a female. If you chat to a foocubus of the same sex as you, it will "cajole" you, which has no effects. Trying to use a [[saddle]] on a foocubus results in [[YAFM]] ("Shame on you!"), as well as [[abuse|abusing]] your [[wisdom]]. 

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|"Amorous demon" is the official gender-neutral name.  Succubi and incubi are no longer distinct monster types, just different genders of the amorous demon type.}}

==Generation==
In addition to the usual methods of monster generation, foocubi can be summoned by kicking a [[sink]] or sacrificing a creature of your own race as a [[chaotic]] character. As a major demon, other major demons can [[gate]] them in, but they cannot summon other demons; they share this trait with another major demon, the [[balrog]], though they may read a [[scroll of create monster]] should one be available. They also cannot be summoned by a cursed [[scroll of genocide]]. 

== Seduction ==
The foocubus may begin the encounter of its own volition if it is hostile, or the player may begin the encounter with the #[[chat]] command.

The foocubus will attempt to remove all armor; with a probability of {{frac|CHA|20}} they will ask your permission, and otherwise will just remove the item. This process repeats for each item of armor you are wearing; the foocubus can only remove your [[suit]] if you have not kept your [[cloak]] on, and can only remove your [[shirt]] if you have not kept your [[cloak]] or [[suit]] on. A foocubus will never attempt to remove an [[amulet]] or [[blindfold]], and will only affect rings if you have a [[ring of adornment]]; see below for details. If you are [[riding]] a mount, the foocubus might steal the saddle off the mount, dismounting you.

If, at this point, you are still wearing [[body armor]] or a cloak, the foocubus will leave you alone and try to teleport away ("'''You're such a <sweet lady|nice guy>; I wish...'''"); otherwise, they will initiate an encounter. ("'''Time stands still while you and <the foocubus> lie in each other's arms...'''") This does not increment the turn counter.

At the end of the encounter, you will experience either a positive or a negative effect; the likelihood of a positive outcome depends on the sum of your [[intelligence]] and [[charisma]] stats. The probability of a positive effect is (IN+CH+1)/35. For this purpose, the sum of IN and CH is capped at 32, giving a minimum 5.7% chance of a negative effect, no matter how high your attributes are.

After the encounter, whether positive or negative, the foocubus may try to take some gold from you as a payment and teleport away. The attempt will fail with a probability equal to your [[charisma]] out of 20 (or always, if you are polymorphed into a [[leprechaun]]). The amount taken usually consists of a 500zm flat fee, plus a random percentage of your current gold outside of any container.{{refsrc|mhitu.c|2484|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=rnd(gold+10) + 500}} However, if you have more than 32757zm, the foocubus's percentage will not take into account any gold beyond that amount. If you have no gold in your main inventory, the foocubus will instead simply teleport away unpaid, with no change beyond an alternate message. ("'''It's on the house!'''") Furthermore, a peaceful foocubus will charge only 1/5 of the usual price—rounded down, but always at least 1zm; a tame foocubus will never charge you.

If you got a positive effect, the foocubus will complain of having a headache and will do you no more favors for 1-100 turns. If you got a negative effect, the foocubus will be ready to go again immediately. However, in either case, there is a 1 in 25 chance that the foocubus will complain of a ''severe'' headache; this means that it has been cancelled, as if struck by the [[wand of cancellation|wand]], and will never be able to seduce you again.
 
=== Positive effects ===
If the sum of your [[intelligence]] and [[charisma]] stats plus one is no less than a random number chosen between 1 and 35, you "'''seem to have enjoyed it more than <the foocubus>...'''" and experience one of the following positive effects with equal probability:

{| class=wikitable
! Effect !! Message
|-
|[[Constitution]] increases by 1 and is exercised.
|'''You feel good enough to do it again.'''
|-
|[[Wisdom]] increases by 1 and is exercised.
|'''You will always remember <the foocubus>...'''
|-
|Heals all [[hit points]] and exercises [[strength]].
|'''You feel restored to health!'''
|-
|Restores all [[power]] and increases maximum by 1-5; exercises [[constitution]].
|'''You feel raised to your full potential.'''
|-
|Raises your level by 1 and exercises [[wisdom]]. This increases your hit points and power, even if you are already level 30.
|'''That was a very educational experience.'''
|}

These last two positive effects are the main reasons to deliberately consort with foocubi (see [[#Strategy|strategy]] below), as they provide a very efficient way to gain [[XL]], [[HP]] and [[power]].

=== Negative effects ===
If, instead, the sum of your [[intelligence]] and [[charisma]] stats plus one is less than the random number chosen between 1 and 35, the foocubus "'''seems to have enjoyed it more than you...'''" and you experience one of the following negative effects with equal probability:

{| class=wikitable
! Effect !! Message
|-
|[[Constitution]] reduces by 1 and is abused.
|'''You are down in the dumps.'''
|-
|[[Wisdom]] reduces by 1 and is abused.
|'''Your senses are dulled.'''
|-
|[[Strength]] is abused and you take 10-16 hit points of damage.
|'''You feel exhausted.'''
|-
|All your [[power]] is lost, your maximum [[energy]] is reduced by 1-10 and your [[constitution]] is abused.
|'''You feel drained of energy.'''
|-
|You lose 1 level unless you have [[drain resistance]].
|'''You feel out of shape.''' (if you lost a level); '''You have a curious feeling...''' (if drain resistant)
|}

== Strategy ==
Foocubi do very little melee damage, and are easy to kill even at low levels. [[#Dealing with negative effects|As discussed further below]], most of their negative seduction effects are also easy to cure. Their true danger lies in what seems like a humorous side effect of seduction: the player is left at least partly disrobed in the presence of any other monsters that happened to be in the room. Players who rely on armor items for [[reflection]] or [[MR]] can find themselves suddenly annihilated by attacks they would usually shrug off. It is therefore a good idea to make absolutely sure that the immediate area is clear and that most monsters cannot close in on you after your encounter.  Foocubi will follow you up or down stairs or when [[branchport|branchporting]] or [[level teleport|levelporting]].  It's possible to collect multiple foocubi on a level where it's safer to be naked.

The probability of a beneficial effect from the encounter is ([[intelligence|INT]]+[[charisma|CHA]]+1)/35. It is therefore a good idea to maximize charisma before consorting with foocubi. Intelligence also helps, but intelligence is the most difficult score to raise. For this reason, wizards are excellent for using foocubi and can often do so well from the beginning of the game. Maximizing charisma, however, is another matter.

A [[ring of adornment]] can raise (or lower) charisma, but foocubi take an interest in them. An incubus may put it on your finger; a succubus may ask you for it, or just take it. The probability of asking, rather than just doing, is in both cases CHA/20 (where CHA is your charisma ''before'' donning or doffing the ring). A female character has a small advantage here, as she can keep a positively enchanted ring on and it will boost her chance of a positive effect. On the other hand, male characters need not ever worry about ''negatively'' enchanted or cursed rings of adornment, nor having a [[ring of levitation]] replaced by a ring of adornment and possibly dropping him into water or lava. A tame succubus will eventually drop any stolen ring.

[[Magic trap]]s have an effect that causes you to gain a point of charisma and tame any monsters in the vicinity if they are tameable, resulting in some unusual [[pets]] (with the message "You feel charismatic!"). However, repeatedly stepping on a magic trap is most likely to have negative results, such as surrounding you with monsters after [[blind]]ing and [[deaf]]ening you, or creating a tower of flame, as from a [[fire trap]]. Having [[fire resistance]], a means of mitigating blindness (e.g. [[telepathy]]), and the ability to handle the summoned monsters is recommended; see the article on magic traps for more detailed information on how to handle such effects.

Meanwhile, [[magic fountain]]s have a 7 in 10 chance of increasing a random attribute by 1, or increasing all your attributes by 1 with a natural Luck of at least 4. However, there is no way to tell if a fountain is magical before quaffing, and the negative effects that quaffing from non-magical fountains can produce are much worse to deal with compared to magic traps, such as cursing your inventory; placing your items in a [[bag]] beforehand is a good idea, as is being prepared to deal with [[water moccasins]] or even a [[water demon]]. See the article on magic fountains for more detailed information. 

Beginning with [[NetHack 3.6.0]], a foocubus will not put on or remove a ring of adornment if you are wearing gloves. He or she will attempt to remove your gloves, with the usual probability CHA/20 of asking first, before putting on or removing a ring. This does not affect succubi stealing rings of adornment that are not worn, because gloves do not impede this act.

A [[helm of brilliance]] can raise (or lower) intelligence. As with all armor, the foocubus may try to take it off; with probability CHA/20, they will ask instead of just removing the helmet. Unlike rings of adornment, the foocubus will never keep the helmet; thus you can put it back on and still get the boost when you try again. Negative enchantments need not cause concern, as you can always give consent to take the helmet off.

===Dealing with negative effects===

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes. Alternatives include [[Potion of restore ability|potions of restore ability]], the [[Spellbook of restore ability|restore ability spell]], [[prayer]], or [[gain ability]].}}

Most negative effects of seduction can easily be dealt with. Loss of wisdom or constitution can be cured by applying a [[unicorn horn]]. Hit points will heal over time (but don't consort with foocubi when you're nearly dead). If you lose a level, go and kill a wimpy monster or eat a [[tripe ration]] to get it back before playing with the foocubus again. Thus, it is possible for a low-intelligence or charisma character to still benefit from dealing with a foocubus, though the process is likely to be tedious. There is no cure for loss of maximum magical energy, and [http://www.nethack.de/spoiler330/succubi.txt The NetHack Incubus and Succubus Spoiler] suggests that if you care about this, you should wait until your intelligence and charisma are high enough that on average you will gain more magical energy than you lose.

To minimize post-assignation vulnerability, you should never voluntarily allow a foocubus to remove anything other than your cloak and body armor; an exception is if you are trying to get a cursed item removed. It is also wise to only consort with foocubi in an area you have emptied of other enemies. You can keep the foocubus out of the way while you do this by luring it up or down a level, or by using [[Elbereth]] whenever it approaches. For further details and special cases, see the "Possible YASDs" section below. Finally, remember to get dressed again afterward! 

To prevent a foocubus from taking your gold, simply keep it in a [[container]]. In an emergency you can also drop it on the ground. A gentlemanly and/or ladylike player may wish to retain a small amount of gold in their inventory, so that the foocubus will receive at least a token payment for its services.  

After the foocubus develops a "severe headache", you can kill it and recover any gold it took from you; the only reasons for leaving it alive are strictly sentimental.

If you have [[Excalibur]], [[Stormbringer]] or the [[Staff of Aesculapius]], you can wield it for protection against the drain level effect.

===Taming foocubi===
As pets, foocubi are next to worthless in combat, but can still be #[[chat]]ted to. Because they are demons, a foocubus cannot be tamed unless you are polymorphed into a demon; however, a foocubus is a valid polymorph form, and thus it is possible to polymorph an existing pet into a foocubus of the opposite gender (or swap gender yourself with an amulet of change or by polymorphing into a foocubus of the opposite gender yourself). Lying with a tame foocubus is no different from with a hostile or peaceful one; all problems including armor removal and self-cancellation remain. The key is that a tame foocubus is much easier to control, as you can lead it to a safe location before engaging it. Additionally, if you possess a magic whistle or move to a non-teleport level, it will not be necessary to chase down the foocubus after each encounter. A tame foocubus will also not be attacked by your pets and can be easily led away from any hostile monsters it would foolishly attack. Once the foocubus becomes cancelled, it should be abandoned or polymorphed; note that polymorphing a cancelled foocubus will create a cancelled monster, so you cannot polymorph it back into a useful foocubus.

===Possible [[YASD]]s===
There are several ways a foocubus can kill you outright, but they are generally easy to avoid.

* Be cautious when using [[levitation boots]] or [[water walking boots]]; the foocubus may remove them, dropping you into [[water]] or [[lava]].
* If you are riding a flying [[steed]] (such as a [[dragon]]) over open [[water]] or [[lava]], a foocubus may seduce it and remove the saddle, causing you to drown. However, being seduced yourself is safe in such a situation, so if you aren't the same sex as your steed, an encounter with a foocubus of the appropriate gender can be undertaken without hazard. However, you usually don't know the sex of your steed, so it's better to stay away from all foocubi in such a situation.
* Females should be similarly cautious when using a [[ring of levitation]] on their left hand, wearing a second ring, and carrying a [[ring of adornment]]; an incubus may replace the ring of levitation with the ring of adornment.
* Avoid wielding [[footrice]] corpses around foocubi unless you have [[charisma]] of 20 or more; they may remove your gloves.
* Characters at [[experience level]] 1 should stay well away from foocubi, as one of the possible negative outcomes is a level drain. In practice, this means that low-level characters should not kick [[sink]]s.
* Be sure to put back all of your clothing ([[armor]]) once you and the foocubus are done.
* When entering [[Medusa]]'s chamber, having a foocubus immediately seduce you and remove your only source of reflection or blindness will likely prove fatal. For this reason, redundancy is always good.

===Removing cursed items===
Foocubi can remove any armor, including cursed armor; succubi can also remove cursed rings of adornment from male characters. Incubi can remove any cursed ring from female characters wearing two rings and carrying an additional ring of adornment. This provides an alternative to [[nymph]]s for ridding oneself of such items.

== History ==
Before [[NetHack 3.6.1]], the outcome calculation used uncapped attributes, making it possible to guarantee a positive result with a combined IN and CH of at least 34.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
The incubus and succubus are male and female versions of the same demon, one who lies with a human for its own purposes, usually to the detriment of the mortals who are unwise in their dealings with them.

&&%s&& %s Wish {147986 2022-08-27T20:34:28Z {4001605 NetSysFire} /* Variants */ - add evilhack section A '''wish''' is an opportunity to be granted an [[item]] of the player's choice.

== Methods ==
There are several ways to obtain a wish in ''NetHack'', including:

*[[Engraving]] with a [[wand of wishing]] or zapping it. A wand is the only guaranteed way, provided your [[Luck]] is 0 or greater. With negative Luck, the probability of a wish is {{sfrac|5 + Luck|5}}, down to zero if Luck&nbsp;≤&nbsp;&minus;5. Cursed wands can explode when zapped (1% chance), but not when engraved with. A newly generated [[wand of wishing]] has 1&ndash;3 charges before recharge, 3 more charges after recharge with a [[blessed]] [[scroll of charging]], and then you can [[wrest]] one last wish. Therefore, it grants a total of 5&ndash;7 wishes.
*Rubbing a [[magic lamp]], preferably [[blessed]], until a [[djinni]] appears. For a blessed magic lamp, you have an 80% chance of obtaining a wish (20% for an uncursed lamp, 5% for a cursed lamp). The worst outcome is a djinni which attacks you instead of granting a wish (5% chance for a blessed magic lamp). After a djinni appears, the magic lamp becomes an oil lamp. Therefore, a blessed magic lamp grants 0.8 wishes on average. In theory you can have more than 120 djinn from lamps,{{refsrc|apply.c|1186}} but not from smoky potions.
*Quaffing a [[smoky potion]], preferably blessed. There is a chance of {{sfrac|13 + 2''d''}} that a djinni appears (where ''d'' is the number of djinn created this game) and, for a blessed smoky potion, a {{frac|4|5}} further chance that he grants you a wish. The worst outcome is a djinni which attacks you (chance {{frac|20}} for each djinni from a blessed smoky potion). When a djinni appears from a smoky potion, you never get the effect of the potion itself. Therefore, a blessed smoky potion grants, on average, {{sfrac|4|65 + 10''d''}} wishes. After 120 djinn appear in the game, they become extinct and never appear anymore.
*Quaffing from (or dipping in) a [[fountain]] above dungeon level 20, unless you have the Amulet. There is a chance of {{frac|30}} that a [[water demon]] appears and a further {{sfrac|20 &minus; ''DL''|100}} chance that he grants a wish (where ''DL'' is the dungeon level); otherwise, he attacks you. The fountain has a {{frac|3}} chance of drying up. Therefore, each fountain grants on average about {{sfrac|20 &minus; ''DL''|1000}} wishes. Possible side effects are dangerous, including [[water moccasin|moccasins]] appearing around you ({{frac|30}} chance), creating a [[water nymph]] ({{frac|30}} chance), or a hostile water demon appearing ({{sfrac|80 + ''DL''|3000}} chance).
*Sitting on a [[throne]], chance {{frac|39}}. The throne has {{frac|3}} chance of vanishing "in a puff of logic", unless you are teleported away. Therefore, each throne grants about {{frac|13}} wishes.<ref>The exact number is {{frac|3|38}}. Chance of wish in one #sit: p1&nbsp;= {{sfrac|3}}&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;{{sfrac|13}}; chance not destroyed in one #sit: p2&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;&minus; chance destroyed = 1&nbsp;&minus; {{sfrac|3}}&nbsp;&times; (1&nbsp;&minus; {{sfrac|3}}&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;{{sfrac|13}}) = {{sfrac|79|117}}; wishes granted by each throne: p&nbsp;= p1&nbsp;+ p2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;p, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|38}}</ref> This may cause unpleasant alternate outcomes.
*Pressing ^W in [[wizard mode]]. This is intended to be used for debugging.

The [[castle]] always has a wand of wishing in a chest in one of the four corner rooms. Unless you are trying for wishless [[conduct]], you should be able to do some wishing before you enter [[Gehennom]].

A successful wish will increase your prayer timeout by 50 to 149 turns.{{refsrc|zap.c|4140}}

==Restrictions==
=== Forbidden items ===
These items can never be granted by a wish outside [[wizard mode]].

* wand of wishing (1:0) ''(10% chance)''
|}

=== Artifact wishing ===

If you wish for an artifact, your chance of receiving it depends on the number of artifacts (but not [[unique item]]s) that have already been generated:{{refsrc|objnam.c|2695}}

{|class="prettytable"
!Generated artifacts !! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! ''n''
|-
!Chance 1 wish
| (always) || (always) || 0.666 || 0.5 || 0.4 || 0.333 || 0.285 || {{sfrac|2|''n'' + 1}}
|-
!Chance 2 wishes
| (always) || (always) || 0.888 || 0.75 || 0.64 || 0.555 || 0.488 || 1 &minus; (1 &minus; {{sfrac|2|''n'' + 1}})<sup>2</sup>
|-
!Chance m wishes
|(always) || (always) || || || || || || 1 &minus; (1 &minus; {{sfrac|2|''n'' + 1}})<sup>''m''</sup>
|}

Otherwise, you receive nothing and the wish is wasted ("For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!"). Similarly, wishing for your own [[quest artifact]] will never succeed (same message). If you wish for an artifact which has already been generated in the game, you will receive its base item instead.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2694}}

If you wish for a [[quest artifact]], you might receive it, but find yourself unable to use it. (See [[intelligent artifact]]s for more details.)

Wishing for an artifact will break the artifact-wishless conduct, regardless of whether you actually receive it.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2688}}

Destroying artifacts will ''not'' increase the chance of successfully wishing for another, since the number ''generated'' is never decremented. Failed artifact wishes don't further decrease the chance of success, however.

== Customization ==

=== Quantity ===

You may wish for only one unstackable item. If you wish for more, you still get only one.

When wishing for a [[stackable]] item, you may wish for more than one. If the amount you wish for is less than the roll of a ''d6'', you get the desired amount; otherwise you get only one.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2472}}

{| class="prettytable"
! Quantity
! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6+
|-
! Success rate
| 1 || {{frac|2|3}}  || {{frac|2}} || {{frac|3}} || {{frac|6}} || 0
|-
! Average
| 1.00 || 1.67 || 2.00 || 2.00 || 1.67 || 1.00
|}

Exceptions to this rule are:{{refsrc|objnam.c|2091}}{{refsrc|objnam.c|2477}}
* [[Candle]]s – you may wish for up to 7
* [[Arrow]]s (all kinds), [[dart]]s, [[crossbow bolt]]s, [[shuriken]], [[boomerang]]s, and [[rock]]s – you may wish for up to 20
* [[Gold piece]]s – you may wish for up to 5000

For gold pieces, any quantity above 5000 is treated as 5000. For the other exceptions, any quantity above the one listed will not be honored at all, and you will receive only 1.

Ranged weapons aside from the ones listed, including [[javelin]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, [[knife|knives]], [[gray stone]]s, and [[gem]]s, follow the same rules as any ordinary [[stackable]] item.

If you wish for a plural of a stackable item, but don't specify a quantity (e.g. "blessed scrolls of charging"), the game treats it as if you wished for two, subject to the probability above. If you specify a quantity of a singular item ("2 blessed scroll of charging"), the parser ignores the singular and uses the quantity specified. Quantities of zero or less are ignored, and the singular or plural status will be used.

Most players wish for 2 or 3 items. Wishing for 3 gives more items when averaged over many wishes, but wishing for 2 is more likely to increase the effectiveness of the current wish.

=== Enchantment ===

When wishing for an item that can be [[enchantment|enchanted]], you may specify the enchantment. If the enchantment you wish for is less than or equal to the roll of a ''d5'', you get the desired enchantment; otherwise you get +0.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2491}}

You ''can'' wish for negatively-enchanted equipment, with the same chance of success as the equivalent positive enchantment. It's not clear why anyone would want to do this, however.

If your [[Luck]] is negative, any enchantment higher than +2 will automatically become negative.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2495}} This check takes place ''after'' the game decides whether it will grant you your specified enchantment, and it only applies for armor, weapons, and weapon tools. If you want to wish for a +6 wand of striking (a bad idea most likely) while your Luck is negative&mdash;assuming you get the wand at all&mdash;you will get a wand of striking with between 4 and 6 charges, just as if your Luck were positive.

{| class="prettytable"
! Enchantment
! +0 !! ±1 !! ±2 !! ±3 !! ±4 !! ±5 !! ±(6+)
|-
! Success rate
| 1 || 1 || {{frac|4|5}} || {{frac|3|5}} || {{frac|2|5}} || {{frac|5}} || 0
|-
! Average
| 0.0 || 1.0 || 1.6 || 1.8 || 1.6 || 1.0 || 0.0
|}

As with quantities, most players wish for +2 or +3 equipment. +3 gives the best average enchantment, but +2's slightly lower average is less chancy. (If you're intending to immediately enchant the item further, however, +2 is strictly better because a blessed scroll is more efficient on a +2 item than on a +3; after using a single blessed scroll on the newly created item, the average enchantment is 3.6 for the +2 case versus only 3.5 for +3.)<ref>Strictly speaking, this is a somewhat self-defeating argument: we say that +2 is better despite a lower average enchantment, and then we "prove" it with another average enchantment figure. A more accurate metric would be the average number of scrolls it takes to raise the item to +5 (for most armor) or +7 (for elven armor and weapons). Wishing for +2 as opposed to +3 does save ~0.030 and ~0.019 scrolls in the +5 and +7 cases, respectively, but this data may be a bit too in-depth for the article.</ref> +4 and +5 have lower averages than +3 ''and'' are more risky as well, so those are usually not used. +1 is certain to work, but its average enchantment is much lower than that of +2 or +3, so it's usually not a good choice unless you are [[illiterate]] and unable to enchant items yourself. The other possible enchantments are obviously not ever very useful, unless you actually want nonpositive enchantment for some bizarre reason.

When wishing for wands or chargeable tools, an enchantment written as "+x" will be interpreted as a wish for x charges. Conversely, a wish for a "dagger (y:x)" is a wish for a +x dagger (the first number has no effect). This occurs because charge and enchantment are the same variable in the structure for objects in ''NetHack'', hence there are no simultaneously enchantable and chargeable objects.

=== Beatitude ===

You can specify whether the item should be blessed, uncursed, or cursed. If your [[Luck]] is zero or greater, your preference will be respected.

If your Luck is negative, explicitly wishing for a "blessed" or "uncursed" item will yield a cursed one instead.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2605}} (Wishing for a "cursed" item still works.)

If you do not specify a beatitude, the item will have a random beatitude as if the item had been randomly generated (regardless of Luck).{{refsrc|objnam.c|2458}} Specifying a negative enchantment as part of the wish (even "-0") will implicitly specify "cursed" unless you specify a beatitude explicitly.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2625}}

You should almost always wish for blessed items, unless you have negative Luck, or specifically want a cursed [[potion]] or [[scroll]]. [[Magic marker]]s should be uncursed, so that cursed paper will produce cursed scrolls. If you desire both cursed and blessed copies of an item (such as [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]] or [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]]), consider wishing for cursed ones, since it is easier to bless items than it is to curse them.

=== Erosion-proofing ===

You can ask for an item to be "rustproof", "erodeproof", "corrodeproof", "[[fixed]]", "fireproof", or "rotproof". If your Luck is non-negative, and the item is subject to [[erosion]] (or is a [[crysknife]]), your preference will be respected.

''NetHack'' does not discriminate between the different types of erosion-proofing, so you may wish for "corrodeproof [[speed boots]]" or a "fireproof crysknife", and the game will substitute the appropriate type of protection.{{refsrc|objnam.c|1845}} Thus, some players recommend making it a habit to add "fixed" to ''every'' wish, to reduce the chance of forgetting to erosion-proof something.

You can also explicitly request an eroded item. If you wish for an item to be both eroded and erosion-proof, the item will ''not'' be erosion-proof.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2641}}

=== Monster type ===

When wishing for a [[tin]], [[corpse]], [[figurine]], [[egg]], or [[statue]], you can specify what type of monster it should be.

If you wish for a tin containing a monster that has been [[genocide]]d, you get an empty tin.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2547}} Wishing for a tin containing a unique monster, a monster that cannot leave a corpse, or a monster giving zero [[nutrition]] (such as a [[wraith]]) will instead produce a random tin.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2548}} You can also wish for tins of [[spinach]].{{refsrc|objnam.c|2238}}

You may not wish for the corpse of a unique monster, or a monster that cannot leave a corpse; doing so will produce a random corpse. Wishing for the corpse of a [[quest guardian]] will instead produce a corpse of the corresponding [[player monster]].{{refsrc|objnam.c|2554}} A partly eaten corpse is lighter than a non-eaten one, so many players prefer those when wishing.

If you wish for a figurine of a unique monster, any kind of human, or a [[mail daemon]], you will instead receive a random figurine.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2567}}

If you wish for an egg from a non-[[oviparous]] monster, you will get a random kind of egg. Wishing for a "[[Scorpius]] egg" will give you a [[scorpion]] egg. You ''can'' wish for an egg from a genocided species, but the egg will never hatch.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2576}}

You can wish for a statue of any monster, including unique and genocided ones. Bear in mind, however, that casting {{spell of|stone to flesh}} on a statue will not always produce that monster&mdash;for example, animating a statue of a unique monster or quest guardian will instead produce a [[doppelganger]] disguised as that monster.{{refsrc|trap.c|439}}

=== Charges ===
Although you can wish for a specific number of charges (e.g. "wand of death (0:7)"), in a normal game you will always receive the lesser of the number of charges you wish for or the number of charges you would otherwise receive, making this an undesirable option. The capability was designed for [[wizard mode]], where you always receive the number of charges you wish for.

You can also wish for charges by specifying an enchantment (so a wish for a "+7 wand of death" is equivalent to the above). Wishing for a "+10 magic marker" is a bad idea, because it will have at most 10 charges.

You cannot normally wish for negative charges.{{refsrc|objnam.c|1912|comment=This is supposed to skip the charge count and go to the <tt>)</tt> for further processing. As <tt>-</tt> is not a digit, the charge count is not actually skipped.}}{{refsrc|objnam.c|1914|comment=This does not find the expected <tt>)</tt> and thus sets <tt>spe = 0</tt>.}} However, it is possible to wish for a negative enchantment instead, which means the same internally. Outside [[wizard mode]], wishing for negative charges on a wand will give you a canceled wand (with -1 charges);{{refsrc|objnam.c|2498}} wishing for negative charges on a tool will give you 0 charges.{{refsrc|objnam.c|2500}}

=== Other item properties ===

You can also specify the following properties:{{refsrc|objnam.c|1833}}

* "holy", "unholy" (sets BUC, even if not [[potion of water]])
* "lit", "burning", "unlit", "extinguished" (for [[lamp]]s, [[candle]]s, and [[potion of oil|potions of oil]])
* "unlabeled", "unlabelled", "blank" (for [[blank scroll|scrolls]] and [[blank spellbook|spellbooks]])
* "[[poison]]ed" (for poisonable weapons and comestibles, and for containers which can be trapped)
* "[[grease]]d" (any item)
* "partly eaten" (for [[comestible]]s)
* "historic" (for [[statue]]s)
* "diluted" (for potions other than water)
* "empty" (for [[tin]]s)
* A general item category, e.g. "scroll" or "spellbook"; this will produce a random item in the chosen category. Pressing enter on a blank line, or escaping out of the wish, will produce a random item. This is still subject to the restrictions on wishing, so wishing for a "lamp" will always produce an oil lamp.

Most of these are useless or worse, but "greased" can be a life-saver for [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, [[spellbook]]s, [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, and [[container]]s, "poisoned" can increase the effectiveness of weapons, and "partly eaten" can make wielded [[chickatrice]] corpses lighter. Some players recommend applying "greased fixed" to every wish, as "fixed" is harmless, and "greased" is only harmful for [[projectile]]s you intend to [[throw]].

You should especially grease all [[armor]], even pieces that can't be [[erosion|eroded]], as [[greased]] [[helm]]s, [[shirt]]s, [[cloak]]s, and [[body armor]] can protect you from [[grabbing]], [[drowning]], and [[mind flayer]]s.

=== Nothing ===

Sometimes, a player gets a wish prompt (for example from a throne or a smoky potion), but wants to keep the wishless conduct. In this case, the player can wish for "nothing", "none", or "nil" to avoid breaking the conduct.{{refsrc|objnam.c|1808}}

== Strategy ==
=== Common wishes ===

The best use of a wish depends heavily on your situation in the game. Here we give some general advice for early and late game situations. This advice is only a guideline and does not apply to all situations. In some cases, if you already have everything you need, the best thing to do with a wand of wishing or magic lamp is to save it for later. Experienced players are able to weigh the value of an unused available wish and compare it to the benefit that would be provided by the most valuable item in the game in that situation. For inexperienced players, there is no substitute for experience&mdash;play and learn!

The following general principles apply in almost all situations:

* If you encounter a wand of wishing, and you can't [[identify]] how many charges it has, then your first wish should be either 2 (or 3) "blessed [[scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]]", or an "uncursed [[magic marker]]", so you can write your own blessed(!) scrolls to recharge the wand.
** Writing your own scrolls will only work reliably if you have already identified scrolls of charging, you have found and named (or identified) all four kinds of 300zm scrolls, or you are a [[wizard]]; however, if you are willing to save some of your wishes for later, i.e. until after you have identified scrolls of charging, a magic marker is an overall more useful item (it can yield three scrolls of charging and still have enough ink to write several scrolls).
** Wands of wishing from bones levels might already have been recharged once.

The rest of this discussion assumes that you have a way to recharge your wand, if the wish is from a wand of wishing.

==== Early single wishes ====

The most common source of early wishes is a [[magic lamp]] (if you disregard slightly suicidal early level fountain quaffers). As a rule, the best item to wish for early in the game is either gray or silver [[dragon scale mail]], unless you are playing a [[Monk]]:

* "blessed greased +2 [[gray dragon scale mail]]" (or +3) provides [[magic resistance]], and
* "blessed greased +2 [[silver dragon scale mail]]" (or +3) provides [[reflection]].

Which one you should wish for is somewhat situational; if you already have one extrinsic, you should wish for the DSM which provides the other. For example, a [[Wizard]] starts with a [[cloak of magic resistance]], and would prefer SDSM. A character who gets the [[amulet of reflection]] from [[Sokoban]], on the other hand, would be better served by GDSM. If you have neither magic resistance nor reflection, the choice is somewhat more difficult; see [[GDSM versus SDSM]] for a more detailed discussion of the merits of each.

For a [[Monk]], the choice is drastically different, due to the large penalty for wearing body armor, which is especially problematic early in the game. Another class's quest artifact is a good choice for a [[lawful]] or [[neutral]] Monk (see {{sa|Quest artifacts|sectionsign=1}} below). However, due to the absence of [[chaotic]] quest artifacts that provide magic resistance, a chaotic Monk needing magic resistance should wish for a "blessed greased fireproof +2 [[cloak of magic resistance]]" (or +3). Alternatively, when magic resistance is not the highest priority, common and useful single wishes include [[speed boots]] or [[gauntlets of power]]. [[The Master Key of Thievery]] is another option for a chaotic Monk due to the extremely useful [[half physical damage]] property, but be wary of its [[artifact blast]].

==== Early wands of wishing ====

A somewhat rarer source of wishes early in the game is a [[wand of wishing]]. With a wand of wishing, you will usually want to wish for some or all of the following items, depending on what you already have: [[dragon scale mail]] (gray or silver), [[amulet of life saving]], some [[artifact weapon]] (unless you're planning to sacrifice for one), a [[bag of holding]] (if [[Sokoban]] doesn't provide one), and [[speed boots]]. All of the above should be blessed, and weapon and speed boots should be also fireproof. Some players wish for 2 blessed scrolls of charging, or a blessed magic marker, in order to access all the wishes immediately. You may also consider wishing for a quest artifact (see {{sa|Quest artifacts|sectionsign=1}}), but its [[artifact blast]] might kill you.

If you encounter a [[wand of wishing]] in a shop, it is easy to [[price identification|price identify]] because its base cost is 500, shared only with the [[wand of death]]. If you have a pet with you, [[Stealing from shops|stealing]] the wand is easy enough. Those who were already planning to use a powerful pet (e.g. [[pacifist]]s) might wish for a blessed [[figurine]] of an [[Archon]]; this carries a 10% chance of backfiring, and a 10% chance of being wasted. Do not wish for a pet unless you are prepared to [[Pet#Protect_your_pet|take care of it]]. Failing this, it is best to simply find 500zm worth of junk to sell to the shopkeeper and then buy the wand. If you're really not sure of your character's ability to survive long enough to do that, it's also possible to simply wish for 5000 [[zorkmid]]s, use some of them to pay the shopkeeper for the wand, and leave with a healthy monetary profit (and more to the point, a wand of wishing with only one charge spent). This is probably the lowest-risk strategy, but the potential rewards are lower too as gold is typically a waste of a wish. A more ostensibly "profitable" method is to wish for a [[wand of death]] and use it to kill the shopkeeper, though that entails the penalty for [[murder]].

==== Late game wishes ====

In the later stages of the game, wishes typically serve the role of completing an [[ascension kit]].

If you need lots of items to complete your ascension kit, consider wishing for a [[wand of polymorph]]. This wand is a very powerful item for players who are not averse to [[polypiling]]. In most cases, it is far more efficient to polypile for ascension kit items and then wish for the few remaining missing pieces, rather than wishing directly for all the items from the start.

An uncursed [[magic marker]] can be used to write cursed [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]], which when read will summon a monster of your choice. This technique is often more efficient than wishing directly for monster-derived items, since a single uncursed magic marker (which takes one wish) can usually write at least four scrolls of genocide with recharging. For example, if your character is reasonably strong, you can obtain dragon scale mail by [[reverse genocide|reverse genociding]] dragons instead of wishing directly for dragon scale mail. As another example, if you need a [[cockatrice]] corpse, it may be more efficient to reverse genocide cockatrices than to wish for a corpse directly. 

==== Quest artifacts ====

:''See {{sa|Artifact wishing|sectionsign=1}} for general information about artifact wishing.''

Generally speaking you should ''not'' wish for cross-aligned quest artifacts. They will “evade your grasp” and fall to the floor, and you will be unable to pick them up. Early-game characters should also avoid wishing even for coaligned quest artifacts, unless they have enough current [[HP]] to survive the inevitable [[artifact blast]]. It is technically possible to carry multiple artifacts of different alignments through careful use of alignment conversion or a [[helm of opposite alignment]], but this tactic is rarely employed. A helm of opposite alignment also cannot cause chaotic or lawful characters to become neutral, so the only way for such characters to use wished-for neutral artifacts is to permanently convert themselves at an [[altar]].

As detailed above, you cannot get your own [[quest artifact]] from wishes.

===== Lawful =====

For lawful characters, the main contenders are [[the Sceptre of Might]], [[the Orb of Detection]] and [[the Magic Mirror of Merlin]], which all offer magic resistance. The Sceptre offers ring-less [[conflict]] and deals double damage against cross-aligned (non-lawful) monsters. The Mirror and the Orb both offer extrinsic telepathy; the Orb also offers [[half spell damage]] and functions as a [[crystal ball]], but is much heavier than the Sceptre or Mirror. If you already have magic resistance, [[the Mitre of Holiness]] is worth considering for a spellcaster due to the energy boost it provides when invoked.

===== Neutral =====
If you are a [[neutral]] character and want a quest artifact, there are at least four good choices:
* "blessed rustproof [[Eye of the Aethiopica]]" (if you are ''not'' a [[Wizard]]) to obtain [[magic resistance]], fast [[power]] regeneration, [[telepathy]], and to #invoke for [[branchport]]ing
* "blessed fireproof [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]" (if you are ''not'' a [[Tourist]]) to obtain [[magic resistance]], [[telepathy]], and to #invoke for non-blessed [[charging]]
* "blessed [[Eyes of the Overworld]]" (if you are ''not'' a [[Monk]]) to obtain [[astral vision]] and [[magic resistance]], and to #invoke for [[enlightenment]]
* "blessed [[Orb of Fate]]" (if you are ''not'' a [[Valkyrie]]) to obtain [[half physical damage]] and [[half spell damage]], and to #invoke to [[level teleport]] (but you will need to obtain [[teleport control]] separately)

[[The Eye of the Aethiopica]] is an especially valuable item for neutral [[Monk]]s; due to armor [[to-hit]] penalty and weaponless [[martial arts]], they will most likely spend a wish on [[magic resistance]]. Comparing the [[cloak of magic resistance|cloak]] and the MR-granting quest artifacts, energy regeneration stands out as extremely useful, since Monks are decent [[spellcaster]]s and their starting spell (whatever it is) becomes vastly more powerful with energy regeneration. [[Branchport]] and [[telepathy]] are also big bonuses that are difficult or impossible for vegetarian Monks to get in any other way.

[[The Eyes of the Overworld]] might be considered a lower priority than some of the others listed, but the [[astral vision]] they provide is useful for making the exploration of [[Gehennom]] less tedious without having to stockpile scrolls of magic mapping. However, if you can cast the divination spells of {{spell of|magic mapping}}, {{spell of|detect treasure}}, and {{spell of|detect monsters}} at a Skilled level, then these combined also provide the key benefits of the Eyes, even revealing information about the entire map at once&mdash;though this of course requires obtaining the appropriate spellbooks and being able to cast them somewhat reliably.

===== Chaotic =====

For chaotic characters, [[the Master Key of Thievery]] is usually considered better than [[the Longbow of Diana]]. No chaotic artifact grants magic resistance, making them somewhat less desirable than artifacts of other alignments. However, the Key still grants the very useful [[half physical damage]] and [[teleport control]] properties, in addition to warning and its [[invoke]] effect.

==== Asking on IRC ====

If you want, you can just join #nethack on [[Libera]] and ask them to suggest what to wish for. It helps if you know what items and perhaps spells, discoveries you already have.

=== What not to wish for ===
The [http://nh.gmuf.com/wish.html NetHack Wishing Spoiler] has a list of good items to obtain without wishing. Here are a few more:

* [[unicorn horn]] &ndash; This is a very common item after you start finding unicorns, and you won't need one very often before then. Early in the game, if you have no unicorn horn but find a wish, you probably want dragon scale mail.
* [[food ration]] &ndash; You are fainting, cannot #[[pray]], and there is no food around? Prefer wishing for a [[horn of plenty]]. If you're not fainting yet but out of food regardless, wishing for a [[ring of slow digestion]] may be better&mdash;NetHack is usually plentiful enough on food that you can find a monster or food item soon enough with the decreased hunger.
* [[potion of holy water]] &ndash; If playing an [[atheist]], wish for two blessed [[scroll of remove curse|scrolls of remove curse]]. Obtain lots of uncursed water, name each one differently so they don't stack, and have nothing but the water and one of the scrolls in your inventory. Read the scroll while confused, un-name all the water, and #[[adjust]] them so they merge into three stacks. Figure out which is which by dipping a known-uncursed useless object (such as a rock) into them, checking for the cursed one with a pet, or [[price identification]] to find the uncursed one. If you only have two stacks, figure out those two and repeat with the other scroll.
** For illiterate atheist players, this is a reasonable wish. See also the [[Potion of holy water#Conduct considerations|complete list of conduct-proof methods]].
* [[dragon scale mail]] (in the ''mid to late game only'') &ndash; Once you have known-cursed paper and you know the [[scroll of genocide]] (or are a [[Wizard]] with high Luck), an uncursed [[magic marker]] is likely a better wish. If you cannot confidently write cursed scrolls of genocide, you may wish for them instead. [[Reverse genocide]] dragons, kill them, and write {{of|scroll|enchant armor}} to make mail from their scales. See the note on [[Dragon scale mail#Acquiring dragon scales|acquiring dragon scales]] for how to do this safely.

== Misspelled wish, non-existent item, and canceling at the prompt ==

If what you enter at the "For what do you wish?" prompt cannot be parsed as a ''NetHack'' item, you will be notified ("Nothing fitting that description exists in the game.") and asked again.{{refsrc|zap.c|4112}} "Cannot be parsed" is a quite loose definition, though; for example, "figuring" will successfully be (mis-)parsed as "ring". However, you have at most five tries; after failing five times you will be given a random object ("That's enough tries!").{{refsrc|zap.c|4115}}

Pressing {{kbd|Esc}} at the prompt will result in a random object being given to you. This breaks the [[wishless]] conduct.{{refsrc|zap.c|4103}} Pressing any of the arrow keys will have the same result as their representation contains an escape character.

[[NAO]]'s patched ''NetHack'' version only clears the input if you press escape; if the input line is already empty, pressing escape will have the same effect as in vanilla ''NetHack'', however.

== Messages ==

{{message|You may wish for an object.|You have been granted a wish.}}
{{message|Unfortunately, nothing happens.|You zapped or engraved with a wand of wishing which had no effect due to negative luck, wasting a charge.}}
{{message|Nothing happens.|Among other causes, this message appears when you zap a wand that has no charges, and may appear when rubbing any type of lamp.}}
{{message|Nothing fitting that description exists in the game.|You made a wish that couldn't be parsed or for an invalid object.}}
{{message|For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!|You wished for an artifact that was not granted, wasting the wish.}}
{{message|Oops! The [object] drops to the floor!|You could not carry the object you wished for, probably because you have no free inventory slots or it is too heavy.}}

== Variants ==
=== SLASH'EM ===
In [[SLASH'EM]], there are not only several new ways to obtain wishes, there are many new targets for wishes and many other chances and ways to get ascension kit items that would be good wish targets in vanilla. The following are some key points to bear in mind.

==== SLASH'EM wish sources ====
SLASH'EM has two additional wish sources: [[pill]]s and [[gypsy|gypsies]], of which the latter is the more important. A common mid- to late-game technique for a character who has a significant number of identified gemstones is to [[reverse genocide]] gypsies, which guarantees several wishes if the player has enough gems. Because this can be done repeatedly, it makes wishes less of a rarity than vanilla. By the time a SLASH'EM player reaches the castle, they rarely need the wand.

==== Common SLASH'EM wishes ====
SLASH'EM has many new artifacts and items which are well worth a wish. The following are some common wish targets:

'''Artifacts'''
*'''Lawful'''
**[[The Crown of Saint Edward]], the [[Yeoman]] quest artifact, is a [[helm of telepathy]] which also provides [[magic resistance]] and [[half spell damage]].
**[[Firewall]] is a lawful [[athame]] that provides fire resistance and does extra fire damage, both of which can be extremely helpful in the early game.
**[[Grayswandir]], the best artifact weapon in vanilla, is still arguably the best lawful artifact weapon in SLASH'EM; it's also harder to get via sacrifice, since there are so many other artifacts to compete with.
**[[Holy Spear of Light]] is a [[silver spear]] which can be invoked for to fry all undead around the player for significant damage.
**[[Reaper]] is a [[halberd]] which does +20 to damage, a great choice for [[riding]] characters such as [[Knight]]s; as it is the second guaranteed sacrifice gift for [[Yeoman|Yeomen]], it is probably not worth a wish for them.
**[[The Stake of Van Helsing]], the [[Undead Slayer]] quest artifact, is a [[wooden stake]] (dagger skill) that does a flat +12 to damage and provides magic resistance.
*'''Neutral'''
**[[Disrupter]] is a mace which deals +30 to damage to [[undead]].
**[[Mjollnir]] is not new in SLASH'EM, but does vastly more damage (flat +24 to non-shock resistant monsters) and is the preferred neutral weapon for most fighting roles.
*'''Chaotic'''
**[[Bat from Hell]] is the most coveted weapon in SLASH'EM, a [[baseball bat]] (club skill) doing a flat +20 damage to all foes.
**[[Deep Freeze]] is an [[athame]] that provides cold resistance and does extra cold damage.
**[[Doomblade]] is a [[short sword]] which does +10 to damage with occasional bonus damage of 5d4; it is the second most powerful chaotic weapon after the [[Bat from Hell]], and may be a good choice for roles that can get Skilled in short swords but are restricted in clubs.
**[[The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa]] is the [[Necromancer]] quest artifact; while less powerful as a weapon that many other chaotic artifacts, it provides magic resistance and can be #invoked to recharge energy (although non-Necromancers will be [[artifact blast|blasted]] for significant damage).
**[[Serpent's Tongue]] is not as powerful as the [[Bat from Hell]] or [[Doomblade]] at +0, but many roles that can't use either effectively can advance dagger to Expert.
*'''Unaligned'''
**[[Wallet of Perseus]] is a [[bag of holding]] which reduces the weight of its contents to {{frac|3}} when uncursed or {{frac|6}} when blessed.

'''Non-artifacts'''
*[[amulet of drain resistance]] &ndash; Provides [[drain resistance]], which is important against [[wand of draining|wands of draining]] and [[deep dragon]]s. It is most useful for players with no access to [[Excalibur]] or [[Stormbringer]].
*[[amulet of flying]] &ndash; Allows a character to fly, meaning they can avoid water, trapdoors, lava, etc. and still pick up items, go down stairs, etc.
*[[amulet versus stone]] &ndash; Like an [[amulet of life saving]] against [[stoning]] attacks, only is re-usable if re-blessed, similar to a [[scroll of scare monster]].
*[[boots of water walking]] &ndash; Only moderately useful in vanilla, some consider these more important than [[speed boots]] or [[jumping boots]] in SLASH'EM due to the new [[create pool]] spell that monsters will use against you.
*[[deep dragon scale mail]] &ndash; Provides [[drain resistance]], which is important against [[wand of draining|wands of draining]] and [[deep dragon]]s. It is most useful for players with no access to [[Excalibur]] or [[Stormbringer]].
*[[figurine]] of a [[solar]] &ndash; A powerful pet, much stronger than an [[Archon]].
*[[potion of gain level]] &ndash; Wishing for 2 or 3 potions of gain level (in the early game) will allow you to [[upgrading objects|upgrade]] mundane objects and obtain multiple [[ascension kit]] items with a single wish (such as a [[helm of brilliance]], [[helm of telepathy]], [[cloak of magic resistance]], [[magic whistle]], or [[bag of holding]], among others)
*[[ring of polymorph control]] &ndash; Already a wish target in vanilla, this becomes even more important in SLASH'EM and can be used to transform into a very powerful [[crystal golem]] or the nigh-invincible [[giant shoggoth]] in conjunction with a [[wand of polymorph]], [[ring of polymorph]], [[polymorph trap]], [[sink]], [[chameleon]] corpse, or [[genetic engineer]].
*[[robe of power]] &ndash; Provides the spellcasting bonus of a [[robe]] in vanilla. It is most useful for [[Monk]]s.
*[[scroll of genocide]] &ndash; If you haven't found a scroll of genocide yet and have some identified gems, it's well worth a wish for a cursed scroll of genocide to reverse-genocide [[gypsy|gypsies]] for multiple wishes (though to do this safely, [[magic resistance]] is required). After you've identified the scroll, you're better off going for a [[magic marker]] to write it yourself.

In general, SLASH'EM has an abundance of items compared to vanilla, given all the extra dungeon branches, not to mention the [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]]. If you happen to find an early [[wand of wishing]] or a mid-game [[magic lamp]], you may want to hold off on using the last wish or two until you have cleared out some of these areas. Additionally, some items which would be wish targets in vanilla can be created by the process of [[Upgrading objects|upgrading]] common items in SLASH'EM, including:

*[[bag of holding]] (from [[oilskin sack]], 100% chance, or [[sack]], 20% chance)
*[[cloak of magic resistance]] (from an [[elven cloak]] or [[oilskin cloak]], 25% chance)
*[[gauntlets of dexterity]] (from [[leather gloves]], 50% chance)
*[[helm of brilliance]] (from a [[dwarvish iron helm]], 50% chance)
*[[helm of telepathy]] (from a [[dwarvish iron helm]], 50% chance)
*[[magic whistle]] (from a [[tin whistle]], 100% chance)
*[[saddle]] (from [[leash]], 100% chance)
*[[tinning kit]] (from [[tin opener]], 100% chance)

Other upgradable objects whose base items are rare enough that they may still be worth wishing for include:
*[[fire horn]] (from a [[tooled horn]], 33% chance)
*[[frost horn]] (from a [[tooled horn]], 33% chance)
*[[magic flute]] (from a [[wooden flute]], 100% chance)
*[[magic marker]] (from a [[crystal ball]], 100% chance)
*[[magic harp]] (from a [[wooden harp]], 100% chance)
*[[horn of plenty]] (from a [[tooled horn]], 33% chance)

Some artifacts which are common wish targets in vanilla may be less useful in SLASH'EM:
*[[The Master Key of Thievery]]'s [[half physical damage]] is superseded by [[the Hand of Vecna]], which is available to all players; a better chaotic artifact wish may be [[the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa]]. Even better yet is the [[bat from hell]].
*[[The Orb of Fate]]'s [[half physical damage]] is also superseded by the Hand of Vecna; it is still useful for [[half spell damage]] and, to a lesser extent, [[warning]].
*[[The Sceptre of Might]] does +5 damage instead of double damage, though [[magic resistance]] and toggle-able [[conflict]] are still valuable.

Additionally, wishing for any of the six artifacts of the [[alignment quest]]s is forbidden ([[the Hand of Vecna]], [[the Eye of the Beholder]], [[Nighthorn]], and the three [[alignment key]]s).

Finally, [[polypiling]] is tougher in SLASH'EM because you need to dip an item in a [[potion of restore ability]] to make the change permanent; while this may not matter for items that can be used immediately such as potions, scrolls, and spellbooks, it has implications when polypiling for equipment like [[ring]]s or [[amulet]]s.

=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]], wands of wishing are [[Wand of wishing#UnNetHack|generated recharged once]] and therefore cannot be recharged. Thus, you may not want to use your first wish on [[Scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]] like in ''NetHack''.

Only wishes from a wand can grant wishes for [[magical item]]s or [[artifact]]s. All other sources can only wish for non-magical items (with the message "I'm sorry but I'm not able to provide you with magical items" occutring if you try); shields of reflection are now non-magical), and thrones do not give wishes at all. Any wish is allowed to specify modifiers like "blessed" and "+2".

[[Magic lamp]]s can now be wished for, since wishes from them can only grant non-magical items. Projectiles can be wished for in quantities up to 100. (Daggers are ''not'' considered projectiles.)

Since UnNetHack 5.1, wishing no longer increments prayer timeout. Since UnNetHack 6, the chance of receiving an artifact is not  depending on the number of artifacts that have already been generated.

[[Dragon scale mail#UnNetHack|Chromatic dragon scales and scale mail]] and [[Thiefbane]] cannot be wished for; unidentified [[dragon scale mail]] is replaced by a random one. Since UnNetHack 5.1, wishing for chromatic dragon eggs is no longer possible. Wishing for statues or figurines of chromatic dragons no longer work since UnNetHack 5.2.0. See [[Chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)]] for details.

Wishing for "reflecting/magic dragon scales (not mail)" is allowed only if you have identified it; alternatively, wishing for "guivre scales" or "leviathan scales" is fine, but you will need to observe these dragons in combat to know which property is held by which race. If you find a wand of wishing before meeting a dragon, and would like dragon scale mail, wish for glowing dragon scale mail, as at the very least you end up with a permanent light source and could end up with (one in five chance of) reflection or [[magic resistance]]. See [[Dragon#UnNetHack|Dragon § UnNetHack]] for changes to dragons in particular.

Good non-magical items include:
* [[shield of reflection]]
* [[stethoscope]]
* [[athame]]
* [[can of grease]]
* [[tinning kit]]
* [[oilskin sack]]
* 5000 [[gold piece]]s
* [[chickatrice]] corpse
* [[leather drum]]
* [[tin of spinach|tins of spinach]]
* [[silver saber]]
* [[silver spear]]
* 100 [[silver arrow]]s
* [[t-shirt]]
* [[oilskin cloak]]
* 3 [[dragon]] eggs
* [[crystal pick]]

=== GruntHack ===
GruntHack allows monsters to wish for items. This can be performed either by a smoky potion or a wand of wishing (monsters never use magic lamps). Monsters wish for a [[scroll of charging]] if performed with a non-recharged wands of wishing. Otherwise, they wish for one of the following items, chosen randomly:

* blessed greased fixed +3 silver dragon scale mail
* blessed greased fixed +3 gray dragon scale mail
* blessed greased fixed +3 cloak of magic resistance
* blessed greased fixed amulet of reflection
* blessed greased fixed shield of reflection
* blessed greased fixed +3 speed boots
* blessed greased fixed +3 gauntlets of power
* blessed greased fixed amulet of life saving
* blessed greased fixed wand of death
* blessed greased fixed partly eaten chickatrice corpse

Monsters will not wish for items granting properties they already have (for example, a strong monster will never wish for gauntlets of power and an Angel will never wish for a cloak of magic resistance). Additionally, they will never wish for things they cannot use (for example an Archon will never wish for a cloak of magic resistance, and monsters who lack gloves and aren't stone resistant will never wish for a chickatrice corpse). If chickatrices are genocided, monsters will wish for a cockatrice corpse. If cockatrices are also genocided, they will try to wish for the corpse anyway and receive a random corpse.

=== xNetHack ===
In [[xNetHack]], wands of wishing always explode when recharged and will turn to dust when they reach 0 charges. xNetHack also allows you to wish for magic lamps, but unlike [[UnNetHack]], wishes from djinn are not restricted to non-magical items. Since you cannot get more than one wish from a magic lamp, the main use of this is for a permanent light source.

The probability of successfully wishing for an artifact is changed to {{sfrac|''n'' + 1}}, where ''n'' is the number of artifacts you have received by wishing. Artifacts generated in any other way are ''not'' taken into account. This means the first artifact wish is guaranteed, and subsequent ones have probabilities of {{frac|2}}, {{frac|3}}, {{frac|4}}, etc.

Although xNetHack implements [[object materials (xNetHack)|object materials]], the material of a wished-for item cannot be specified outside of [[wizard mode]]. An item received by wishing always has its base material.

=== dNethack ===

In dNethack, wands of wishing have been removed and replaced with rings of wishing and [[Candle_of_invocation|candles of invocation]]. A candle of invocation can be used once to summon either a djinn, pet, or demon and then is consumed; summoning a djinn grants one wish.

Rings of wishing can be used several times and must be worn and invoked to make a wish. A ring of wishing replaces the wand of wishing in the chest in the Castle.

Wishing for artifacts have been significantly reworked as well. Rather than counting the number of artifacts that already exist, the player starts with one artifact wish available and gains the ability to wish for another artifact based on two events:

*Sitting on the [[throne]] inside the [[Castle]]
*Giving an artifact to each of the five [[priest of an unknown god|priests of an unknown god]]

Each event allows the player to wish for one more artifact. Gifts or named artifacts have no direct effects on your artifact wish abilities. 

While there are [[DNetHack_artifacts|many additional artifacts in dNethack]], many of them are unwishable, including quest artifacts. However, there are several good candidates for wishing that should be considered:

*[[DNetHack_artifacts#Aegis|Aegis]], which grants reflection and half physical damage and can be invoked downward for an instant triple Gorgoneia ward
*The [[DNetHack_artifacts#Lance_of_Longinus|Lance of Longinus]], which when wielded, conveys half physical and spell damage, magic resistance, and reflection (though you could be in extreme peril if you lose the weapon or get disarmed)
*The [[DNetHack_artifacts#Premium_Heart|Premium Heart]], gauntlets of power that also improve dexterity, provide double damage, and have increased damage multipliers for various status ailments

===FIQHack===

In [[FIQHack]] you can wish for a magic lamp (and receive it).

===EvilHack===

In [[EvilHack]], one should make use of its [[EvilHack#Object materials|object materials]] and [[EvilHack#Object properties|properties]] whereever possible. Common wishes include:

* blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide hawaiian shirt of decay
** An excellent use of the shirt slot because there are no artifact shirts.
* blessed greased fixed +3 dragonhide speed boots
* For illithids: blessed greased fixed +3 bone gauntlets of power
** Depending on your personal preferences, you may want to use stone instead of bone.

A '''potion of enlightenment''' allows you to momentarily see your [[intrinsic]]s and other attributes.

== Effects ==

{{main|enlightenment}}

When [[quaff]]ed, both blessed and uncursed potions exercise wisdom and provide [[enlightenment]]: a brief indication of many of your normally hidden attributes.

If the potion is blessed, it has the added effect of increasing your [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]] by one point each.

A cursed potion will only abuse wisdom&mdash;not even providing enlightenment. You receive the message ''"You have an uneasy feeling..."'' and are prompted to name the potion.

== Strategy ==
{{main|Alchemy}}

Despite its good natural uses, the potion of enlightenment is usually saved for [[alchemy]] as it can be used in a recipe to create [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]].

As with all alchemy, there is a {{frac|10}} chance of an alchemic blast, where the mixture will explode. The blast will take 1 to 10 HP from you, and it will generate [[vapors]] from the potion being dipped. The blast will also [[abuse]] your [[strength]].{{refsrc|potion.c|1668}}

  |weight=2
  |conduct=vegetarian
}}

A '''lump of royal jelly''' is a special [[comestible]] that is usually only found in [[beehive]]s (it can also be created by a [[horn of plenty]]). 
Royal jelly is [[vegetarian]] but not [[vegan]].

==Effects==

Eating a blessed or uncursed lump of royal jelly will increase your [[strength]] (if not already maximized) by +1.{{refsrc|eat.c|1692}} If cursed, it will decrease your strength by one.

If your legs are [[wounded legs|injured]], they will be healed.

Your [[hit points]] are increased by 0-20 (or decreased if the jelly is cursed). If this would raise your HP above your max HP, there is a 6.25% chance (1 in 16) to increase your max HP by one.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Applying royal jelly to objects will smear it on them. Currently the only object affected by this is the [[egg]]. Cursed royal jelly will kill an egg; uncursed will rejuvenate it; and blessed will make the egg recognize you as its parent if it hatches in your inventory. This only works on monster eggs. Additionally, using royal jelly of any beatitude on a killer bee egg will turn it into a queen bee egg.}}

==Strategy==

Royal jelly is a popular comestible to store for the [[ascension run]], as it has a very good [[Nutrition/Weight|nutrition-to-weight ratio]] and can be eaten in one turn, both of which can be crucial concerns in the late game.

==Variants==
===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]] lumps of royal jelly can also be found in [[delicatessen]] shops.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"'Royal Jelly,'" he read aloud, "'must be a substance of
tremendous nourishing power, for on this diet alone, the
honey-bee larva increases in weight fifteen hundred times in
five days!'"

"How much?"

"Fifteen hundred times, Mabel.  And you know what that means
if you put it in terms of a human being?  It means," he said,
lowering his voice, leaning forward, fixing her with those
small pale eyes, "it means that in five days a baby weighing
seven and a half pounds to start off with would increase in
weight to five tons!"

&&%s&& %s Throne {149057 2022-11-19T11:24:32Z {375 Ion frigate} De-SLEX {{features}}
In ''[[NetHack]]'', a '''throne''', {{yellow|\}}, is a special [[dungeon feature]] that occurs in [[throne room]]s and in special areas such as the [[Castle]], [[Fort Ludios]], and [[Vlad's Tower]].

Half the [[quest]]s have one throne somewhere along the path. Those that have none are the [[Caveman quest]], the [[Monk quest]], the [[Priest quest]], the [[Rogue quest]], the [[Samurai quest]], and the [[Valkyrie quest]].

You have a nearly {{frac|3|40}} (7.5%) chance of obtaining at least one [[wish]] if you #[[sit]] on a throne until it gets destroyed.<ref>chance destroyed without wish in one #sit: p1 = ({{frac|2|3}}+{{frac|3}}×{{frac|11|13}})×{{frac|3}} = {{frac|37|117}} (nothing+(no wish, no teleport)); chance not destroyed and no wish in one #sit: p2 = ({{frac|2|3}}+{{frac|3}}×{{frac|11|13}})*{{frac|2|3}}+{{frac|3}}×{{frac|13}} = {{frac|77|117}} ((nothing+(no wish, no teleport))+teleport); total chance no wish until destroyed: p3 = p1+p2×p3, p3 = {{frac|37|40}}; so chance of at least one wish: p = 1&minus;p3 = {{frac|3|40}}</ref><ref>point 5. in the "General Wishing Guidelines" section of http://nh.gmuf.com/wish.html</ref>

==Sitting on a throne==
:''This section is based on [[thrn-343.txt]].''

The usual way to interact with a throne is to sit on it. As with all dungeon features, you cannot sit on a throne if you are [[riding|mounted]], [[levitation|levitating]], or [[engulfing|engulfed]], or if there are objects in the square.

When you sit on a throne, there is a {{frac|2|3}} chance that nothing happens.
*  ''"You feel somehow out of place..."''
* ''"You feel very comfortable here."'' (If you are polymorphed into a [[queen bee]], [[dwarf king]], [[gnome king]], [[ogre king]], or [[Elvenking]])

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Thrones will also give this message to a [[crowned]] player.}}

Otherwise, there is a {{frac|1|3}} chance of one of the following:
{|class="prettytable"
|1
|
If (natural [[Luck]] + d5 &minus; 1) is zero or positive, you get to make a [[wish]]. Natural Luck is your Luck without any bonuses from carrying a [[luckstone]]. Otherwise, your Luck is increased by one.
* ''"You feel your luck is changing."''
|-
|2
|
You get to [[genocide]] one species, as for an uncursed [[scroll of genocide]].
* ''"A voice echoes: "By thy Imperious order, &lt;Sire/Dame&gt;...""''
|-
|3
|
You can [[identify]] items from your inventory, as with a blessed [[scroll of identify]].{{refsrc|sit.c|256}} However, you do not lose illiterate conduct, and positive Luck does not increase one item to two. It will identify 1, 2, 3, 4, or all items; each of these has an equal 20% probability.
* ''"You are granted an insight."''
|-
|4
|
If you are within 5 hit points of maximum, your max HP is increased by 4. Your hit points are then restored to maximum whether increased or not. Also cures all blindness, all sickness, and wounded legs.
* ''"You feel much, much better!"''
|-
|5
|
If your Luck is non-negative and you don't already have intrinsic [[see invisible]], you acquire that intrinsic.
* ''"Your vision becomes clear."''
Otherwise, if the level can be magic-mapped, it is.
* ''"An image forms in your mind."''
Or, if the level cannot be mapped, you are [[confusion|confused]] for d30 (more) turns.
* ''"A terrible drone fills your head!"''
|-
|6
|
You add 1 point to a random attribute.
* ''&lt;Usual attribute-gain message&gt;''
|-
|7
|
You lose d4+2 points from a random attribute, and d10 hit points.
* ''&lt;Usual attribute-loss message&gt;''
|-
|8
|
If [[shock resistance|shock resistant]], you lose d6 hit points.
* ''"An electric shock shoots through your body!"''
Otherwise, you lose d30 hit points.
* ''"A massive electric shock shoots through your body!"''
In both cases, your constitution is abused. Items in inventory are not at risk of explosion.{{refsrc|sit.c|173}}
|-
|9
|
If you have any gold in your main inventory, it all disappears.
* ''"You notice you have no gold!"''
Otherwise, no effect.
