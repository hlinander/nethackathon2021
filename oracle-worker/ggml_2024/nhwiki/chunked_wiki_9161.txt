| Proper names may be incorrectly preceeded by "the" when hallucinating.
| Some of the capitalized entries in bogusmons should (and do) get the article ("The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal", "the Klingon", etc.), which is all very well, but others very clearly should not and yet currently do ("The Totoro", "The Barney the Dinosaur", "The Morgoth", "The Godzilla", "The Smokey the bear", "The King Kong").  The code needs a way to distinguish these two cases -- either two separate lists, or some kind of flag to indicate which ones that should not use "the". Allegedly fixed by Grunt; fix ported with fixups by Sean Hunt. Still not sure if it catches all cases.

| When an unseen monster forces a polymorphed hero out of hiding, feedback is insufficient.
| May refer to the fact that the message when you fall from the ceiling (when polyselfed into a piercer) goes straight into the old messages without passing go or collecting two hundred dollars.  You can, however, see it with ^p. As best I can figure, this happens because you don't get a chance to move (which is probably by design; hostile piercers don't get a chance to move after falling either).
