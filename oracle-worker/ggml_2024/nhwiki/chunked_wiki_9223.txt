Only one '''garo master''' will be generated. It carries [[shuriken]]s and two [[curse]]d [[stiletto]]s. When it dies, it divulges a single [[major consultation]], then explodes for 4d8 damage. This major consultation does not interfere with XP gains from consulting with the [[Oracle]]. It is guaranteed to leave behind a garo master mask after death.

In the last few months of 2015 he slowed down considerably, but he still reached #1 on the multi-variant Z-score ladder. Apart from quantity, his other feats include long rows of non-vanilla ascensions, including an 11-game [[dNetHack]] streak and a 4-game [[DynaHack]] Elberethless streak (where the games were his first four DynaHack games). He has by far the most [[dNetHack]] wins. Moreover, starting in March 2018 he played several games of [[SLASH'EM Extended]] 2.1.7 and 2.2.2 on the hardfought.org server and ascended all of them on the first try, currently holding a 4-ascension streak with a 100% win rate. In Junethack 2018, Tariru ascended all 13 available variants, thereby getting the King of the World trophy; notably, he had no losses during the tournament at all, ascending each of the variants on the first try, some of which he had never played before.

The '''uvuudaum''' is a dangerous monster added in [[dNetHack]], as part of the {{white|U}} "unknown abomination" [[monster class]].

Until the player becomes a demigod (by killing the [[Wizard of Yendor]]), uvuudaums will peacefully float around the level, meditating. Even if provoked from their meditation, they will soon return to being peaceful. However, they will cease their meditation once the player is on the ascension run, and will be hostile.

One should always wear a helmet when fighting an uvuudaum, for fear of their headspike attack otherwise being able to instakill the player.

Uvuudaums have intrinsic [[life saving]], though it can activate no more than once every 34 turns. They also heal 25 HP per turn and have 10 intrinsic damage-reduction

Uvuudaums cast the following spells with a base damage of 19d6:
*Psi bolt: Direct damage (capped at 50)
*Spacewarp: Direct damage (capped at 100) 
*Stun: Causes [[stun]]ning
*Paralyze: Causes [[paralysis]]
*Time stop: Allows hastened recovery (50&ndash;125 HP)
*Temporal duplicate: Creates a clone with timed life
*Nail to the sky: Applies cursed [[levitation]]
*Prismatic spray: Multiple large elemental explosions (6d6 each)

Uvuudaums receive +20 to hit, and deal an extra 3d7 damage to curse-sensitive enemies (primarily Angels) and an extra 4d9 damage to holy-hating enemies (primarily demons and undead).

{{encyclopedia|
Strange creatures with long, claw-tipped tentacles in place
of heads, Uvuudaums hail from a far realm beyond the known
planes. It is said that they are the lords of those realms,
although evidence for this is thin at best. As with all
supposed facts about that place, that claim is more likely
a gross anthropomorphism, if not an outright falsehood.
The merest glimpse of their form drives men mad, and they 
are capable of crushing a man's head with a single flick 
of their headspikes. Even if the victim escapes this fate,
their long spikes run with strange venoms.}}

'''Dread seraphs''' are monsters in [[dNetHack]]. They are found sealed in sepulchers in the [[Dungeons of Doom]].  Approximately {{frac|8}} of dungeon levels below level 13 will contain a sepulcher. Sepulchers are 5x5 rooms with double-thick walls, leaving one square in the center for the seraph itself. The walls are undiggable, and the inner set are unphaseable as well. 

<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
1={{magenta|Z}}

||1||

</replacecharsblock></div>
For most of the game, dread seraphs will lie dormant in their sepulchers, though their presence on a level causes corpses to rise from the dead as zombies or skeletons. Once the player kills the [[Wizard of Yendor]] or picks up the [[Amulet of Yendor]] for the first time, the dread seraphs will wake up. When the player next visits a level containing a dread seraph in a sepulcher, an earthquake will occur and a chasm will open, freeing the seraph.  

[[File:awakedreadseraph.png|thumb|The chasm formed when a dread seraph awakens.]]

Most of the interesting properties of dread seraphs come from their songs; they use one of them every several turns:
* All creatures on the level are affected by a kind of death magic. Players who resist take 1d(m_lev) damage.
* Revives all corpses on the level.
* Confuses, stuns, and berserks all monsters on the level. Players hallucinate and are confused and stunned.
* Causes an earthquake, creating pits which contain newly generated monsters.
* Locks all doors and containers on the level, and creates new locked doors in doorways.

If a dread seraph drops below {{frac|4}} of his maximum HP or becomes crazed, it will begin to pray. After 5 moves, it will be restored to full health and cured of any status ailments. At the same time, it will apply a [[studied]] debuff to you, equal to its monster level (typically 54). Unlike players, the seraph is not invulnerable while praying.

Dread seraphs have significant health pools (1500+) and take {{frac|4}} damage from weapon attacks, so it is usually a better idea to leave the level than to try to kill one.

Players killed by a dread seraph appear as [[skeleton]]s in [[bones]] files.

The '''maid''' is a [[Human (monster attribute)|human]] monster that appears in [[dNetHack]]. Their statline is partially based on that of the [[nurse]].

Maids will 'tidy up' the dungeon by picking up any and all loose items. A maid that picks up a [[cursed]] item has an 80% chance of uncursing it - the remainder of the time, she will banish it to hell by drawing a semi-permanent [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Pentagram|pentagram]] [[Ward (dNetHack)|ward]] in ink; the items can be found on the same level as the [[vibrating square]].

==Generation==
Maids are [[Monster starting inventory|guaranteed to get]] four daggers, with a 1% chance of an additional [[silver dagger]]. They have different additional armor and weapons based on what role you are playing when they are generated:

*For non-[[Samurai]] players, maids will be generated with a [[katana]] (70% chance) or a [[stiletto]] (30% chance), and have an independent 25% chance of getting either a stack of [[shuriken]] or [[dart]]s. 
*For Samurai, the maid has a 25% chance of getting a [[ninja-to]], a 20% chance of a katana, a 5% chance of a [[naginata]], and a 50% chance of a stiletto for their primary weapon slot.

==Strategy==
A player who does not yet know the pentagram can learn the ward by leaving cursed items near a peaceful or pacified maid.

==Origin==
The maid's starting equipment is an allusion to the "ninja maid" trope that appears in contemporary media.

Of note is that maid clothing such as the [[maid dress]], [[frilled apron]], and [[katyusha]] can be found in [[NetHack brass]], but maids themselves do not appear.

Many of the random humans will be [[quest guardian]]s from the roles from whose pantheons the lawful, neutral, and chaotic gods of your game are taken.  Depending on which pantheons those are, they may be more or less of a threat to you.  Some may have extra melee attacks ([[pirate brother]]s, [[roshi]], [[warrior]]s) or [[Monster spell|spellcasting]] abilities ([[abbot]]s, [[acolyte]]s, [[apprentice]]s, and [[guide]]s).

You arrive in the portal outside the walls of the library.  Your [[quest leader]], the [[strange corpse]] ([[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Roles/Binder/Dahlver-Nar|Dahlver-Nar]], the first Binder), will be found inside the library, at the point marked {{magenta|M}}.  Note that all of the doors to the library are actually empty doorways.

The library contains five cursed [[Scroll of scare monster|scrolls of scare monster]] embedded in the walls of [[solid rock]].  These can be dislodged with a [[wand of teleportation]], but because each one is cursed you will not be able to pick it up without it disintegrating.

Scattered throughout the level are sixteen peaceful [[shade]]s, which in the ASCII interface are easy to mistake for [[solid rock|rock]].  Although these are found on the home level and are peaceful, like [[quest guardian]]s, they are not really quest guardians - i.e., they will not give you messages when you #chat with them.

The entire level is considered a [[Crypt|morgue]].

===Upper filler level(s)===
These levels are open, with random outcroppings of [[solid rock]].  Each level has three random objects, four random traps, two hostile [[lich]]es, and six other random hostile monsters.

The locate level contains a hostile captain, lieutenant, two hostile sergeants, and six hostile soldiers, nine other monsters, and 16 peaceful [[peasant]]s.  The peasants are the real quest guardians and will reply with messages if you #chat with them.

The large building on the right is a randomly aligned [[Temple|shrine]].

The layout is mostly identical to the goal level of the [[Noble quest]], except that the shrine has a down [[staircase]] behind the altar.

===Lower filler level(s)===
This level is an ordinary room-and-corridor level, with six rooms, three of which are [[Crypt|morgue]]s filled with hostile undead.  The other three contain one [[wraith]] and one [[human zombie]].  Two of the morgues and two of the other rooms contain one random trap.

The downstair will be in one of the morgues.

Behind the secret door to the Tower of Woe is a long hall flanked by two pairs of [[barracks]], a decorative room with a [[fountain]], a prison (with eight peaceful [[prisoner]]s), and four [[shop]]s (a bookstore, scroll shop, food shop, and one random).  The secret rooms off the barracks on the left contain random blessed weapons; those on the right contain random wands.

The three smaller rooms in the center right are [[Temple|shrine]]s randomly assigned to the three alignments.  The altar in the larger room to the far right is unaligned.  

The [[quest nemesis]], Acererak, is not automatically generated, but appears when the unaligned altar is converted through [[sacrifice]].  This room, in turn, can only be accessed once all three of the altars in the shrines have been converted.  Since these are all temples, you will have to deal with the angered [[priest]]s.  The last altar is attended by a random {{white|L}} and three skeletons.

The upstair is located somewhere at the left end of the map.  Besides the undead and the humans generated with the special rooms, nine random monsters are scattered throughout the level.

==Messages==
===Transporter level===
On descending to the level where the transporter is located:
 You sense something reaching out to you...

===Entry===
First time:
 Suddenly, you stand before the ruins of an ancient building. All 
 around you, shadows flit and flicker below an indistinct sky. A
 cold breeze blows in aimless breaths, bearing the rumor of distant
 whispers.
 
 You know this place well; though you have been here but once before,
 and that in a dream. That night, as you stood over the strange, dry
 corpse that sprawls alone within the shell of this ruined library,
 the wind whispered to you with a thousand tounges, speaking the 
 names that still ring in your ears, the names that drove you
 into exile.
 
 You do not dream now. The wind is filled with a muted tension, 
 as of a scream just bellow the threshold of hearing, and dark
 creatures stalk the wastes around the lost library.

Next time:
 Once again, you stand before the lost library.  You know that the strange corpse
 still waits within.
If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you stand before
 the lost library.

===Quest guardians===
(Note that the quest guardians are the [[peasant]]s on the locating level, not the peaceful shades on the home level.)
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Why have you returned? The Order of Seropaenes is hunting you!"
 "Get out!"
 "Go away! These fanatics never bothered us, before you left!"
 "The baron is going to kill you, and all that have harbored you!"
 "The Order of Seropaenes will hunt you down."
If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Leave, now!"
 "Go."
 "This is no longer your home."
 "Run, or the baron will kill you!"
 ....
The [[prisoner]]s on the goal level will respond with the following if #chatted to:
 "All this, because of a dream?"
 "Why are they doing this?"
 "I thought these religions had nothing to do with each other!?"
 "Shouldn't these gods be enemies?"
 "To what Power are the Keter sworn?"
 "They said the world was cracked. They said it was our fault."
 "They said there is an Enemy in the Void."
 "They say the Enemy seeks to destroy the world, though she is not of it."
 "I heard them talking about a device to force open a path to the Void."
 "I saw them bring in a silver bell."
 "I heard a bell ring frantically, just a short while ago."

===Quest leader===
When you first meet your quest leader:
 For the second time in your life, you stand above the strange mumified 
 corpse that lies alone in the ruined library.
 
 You feel something reaching out to you, as though across an infinite
 distance.
When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 You stand again above the mumified corpse, and again you feel something
 reach for you within your mind.
This message is not currently used:
 You stand again above the mumified corpse, and again you feel something
 reach for you within your mind.
When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test seven times:
 You feel that you have left your path, and will never again stand in
 this place.
When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 The reacher falls back, in failure. Perhaps an Akousmatikoi could hear it.
When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 You feel that you have left your path, and must return to the Void.
When finally assigned the quest:
 You reach out as well, and together you bridge the distance.
 
 A bloody form now hangs before you, a form that may once have been
 a man, now savaged by great beasts. So violent was the attack that
 the beasts' teeth were torn from their sockets, and lodged in the
 man's skin. The shear variety of teeth bears mute witness to the
 number of assailants that dogged the man.
 
 The thousand wisperers speak as one: "Dahlver-Nar; Dahlver of the
 teeth; the first to listen, the first to speak. Dahlver-Nar, of
 the Gates of Teeth, who built the way through which we reach."
 
 The bloody form moans in pain and paws at it's ruined, 
 toothless mouth with its ruined, tooth-torn hands.
 
 "Another now seeks to close those Gates. A mortal man, who died
 and yet walked on, who moulderd to dust, and yet thought on.
 Acererak the Devourer, Acererak the skull; who lives and stands
 and thinks now on both sides of the Gates, who has but to bite
 down, to cut off the breeze through which we talk, to sever 
 the way on which you walk."

===Encouragement===
Subsequently #chatting to the strange corpse will not give any significant messages.

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 This place, too, you know well, for it is the village of your waking
 life, the village of your birth.
 
 In your youth, the world was a simple place. You could see your whole
 life, mapped out in the lives of your ancestors. You knew the one 
 that you would wed, the church where you would marry, the land that 
 you would work, and the place that you would lay until the world
 was remade.
 
 But all that was swept away in a single night, by the dream that
 led to your exile.
 
 Some strange magic is at work, for your village is not located near
 the Lost Library. At least, you don't think it is, you never were
 a traveler. You resolve to pass quickly through the village. You 
 know of a passage to the woods outside town, through the church
 catacombs.
When returning:
 You stand again in the waking world, in the village of your birth.
When first entering the goal level:
 You have come upon a tower in the woods outside your village. You are
 certain that this wasn't here when your exile began. You feel that 
 Acererak is within.
When returning:
 You stand again before the tower.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So, you are the one who dreamt of the Gate. All your false sinner
 spirits will not avail you against me. I shall slay you, then return
 beyond the Gate, to close the path your kind have opened into the world."
Upon further meetings:
 "I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."
And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "Once, I was lost, aimless, but now I serve the one true God!"
When you have the Pen of the Void, but Acererak has not been destroyed:
 "Give me the Pen of the Void."

====Discouragement====
Acererak will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "This is your final night!"
 "Your sinner spirits will not save you from me!"
 "In God's Name!"
 "You shall never pass the Gate!"
 "You have reached the end of your path."
 "Your gnostic nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
 "Come, Binder.  I shall kill you, then live forever."
 "Once you are dead, there will be none to contest my 
 hold over the Teeth."
 "Fight, Binder, or are you afraid of the mighty Acererak?"
 "You have failed, Binder.  Now, my victory is complete."

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you pick up the Pen of the Void, you feel the power of it
 flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more worlds
 at once, even though you are holding it.
(Note that if you received [[the Pen of the Void]] earlier as a [[sacrifice gift]], you will get this message when you first pick it up, rather than here.)

When destroying the nemesis:
 Acererak falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.
 
 You fool! You have killed me, and all you love.
 There is an Enemy in the Void. She comes from outside
 the world, to drown it all in waves of Chaos!
 
 His golden skull shatters to jewelled fragments when it hits.
 The whispers on the wind grow more distinct, and the fragments
 are drawn together by the breeze. You can here them clearly now.
 It is Acererak's name they repeat.
When returning to your quest leader:
 Dahlver-Nar is still dead
When subsequently throwing the Pen of the Void to the strange corpse:
 You pick the Pen of the Void back up.

===Post-Quest===
Talking to the strange corpse after the quest or after getting the [[the Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]] will not produce any messages.

The '''strange corpse''' is the [[quest leader]] for the [[Binder]] role, added in [[dNetHack]] and [[SlashTHEM]].

In dNetHack, #chatting with the corpse when ready for the Quest reveals that it belonged to [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Roles/Binder/Dahlver-Nar|Dahlver-Nar]], the first Binder, who became a binding spirit himself. Talking to the corpse not only allows you to use the down [[staircase]], but automatically binds his spirit and teaches you his seal. There is no message indicating that his spirit has been bound, so Binders may be surprised later when they check their [[base attributes]] and learn that they have teeth beneath their skin.

As a quest leader, the corpse does not seem to be so much a mentor who provides the player with instructions and encouragement, as a mere mouthpiece through which [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Roles/Binder/Numina|an unnamed entity or collection of entities]] informs you about [[Acererak]]. After you are accepted for the quest, it does not say anything else&mdash;not even if you return victorious from defeating the quest nemesis, or stop by to visit it with the [[Amulet of Yendor]].

The strange corpse has a single melee attack, but its speed of 0 makes it effectively [[sessile]] and unable to defend itself.  However, its very low natural [[AC]] and high [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] make it difficult to fight.

==Encyclopedia entry==
There is no encyclopedia entry for the strange corpse, but there is one for [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Roles/Binder/Dahlver-Nar|Dahlver-Nar]].

'''Acererak''', {{yellow|L}}, is a monster that appears in [[dNetHack]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. He is a powerful [[lich]] that serves as the [[Binder]] [[quest nemesis]] in all of his appearances, and guards the [[Bell of Opening]] alongside the Binder [[quest artifact]].

==Generation==
In dNetHack, it is possible to have the quest artifact, [[The Pen of the Void]], well before you encounter Acererak; this is because the Pen is also the Binder's first [[sacrifice gift]]. Regardless of how it is first obtained and when, defeating Acererak restores the Pen to its [[The Pen of the Void#Dual Blade Form|double-bladed form]], making it a [[double damage]] weapon and increasing the effects of spirits bound into it. Defeating Acererak also teaches you [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Roles/Binder/Acererak|his seal]], so you can bind him as a spirit.

==Strategy==
{{todo|Fill out this section}}

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Acererak}}
Acererak the Devourer is a character that originates from the Greyhawk setting of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. He was a cambion, a demonic offspring of a powerful summoned balor named Tarnhem and a human woman. Ten years after his conception, she is killed by a torch-wielding mob, and the young half-demon is rescued by [[Vecna]]; the Whispered One kills his advisors when they urge him to kill the child, and instead takes on Acererak as an apprentice. The ten-year-old Acererak loathed life and looked forward to becoming undead like his master; during Vecna's siege of Fleeth, the lich is severely wounded and rescued by Acererak, earning him a promotion.

At some point, Acererak moves to the Vast Swamp where he constructs a lair for himself, best known as the infamous [[wikipedia:Tomb of Horrors|Tomb of Horrors]]; Acererak also builts a subterranean temple complex in the name of [[Orcus]], burying its architect and all of its workers within. He then fully succumbs to the lure of lichcraft and has himself buried in the labyrinthine tomb, where he achieves demilichdom and leaves his body behind for the planes beyond. The sequel module ''Return to the Tomb of Horrors'' retcons this, instead portraying the Tomb as an anetchamber to Acererak's true dwelling - a lost city on the Negative Energy Plane's border, where he plotted to fuse his essence with the plane and gain multiversal control over all undead.

Acererak is thwarted by the player adventurers and destroyed; in the 3rd edition of ''D&D'', he lingers on after his passing as a vestige that can be summoned and bound by Binders, the basis for his role as the Binder quest nemesis.

[[Binder (dNetHack role)|Binder]]s will return as broken shadows in [[bones file]]s.

The '''exile''' is the [[player monster]] equivalent of the [[Binder (role in dNethack)|Binder]] role in [[dNetHack]].  It is also the lowest [[Binder (role in dNethack)#Rank titles|rank title]] for a Binder.

Like other player monsters, exiles are never randomly generated and are thus rarely seen.  No exiles are normally found outside the [[Astral Plane]], where they may appear among the hostile player monsters generated there.<ref>{{function|mplayer.c|create_mplayers}}</ref>

Reading a cursed [[scroll of genocide]] as a Binder while [[confused]] will summon a number of exiles, although they won't have their usual equipment.  Using [[undead turning]] on the corpse or [[stone to flesh]] on the statue of a dead exile left on a [[bones level]] will revive the corpse or statue as a player monster. Exile corpses may be found in the [[Valley of the Dead]],{{refsrc|gehennom.des|65}} and a statue of an exile may appear on [[Medusa's Island]].{{refsrc|sp_lev.c|1004|comment=the code is very cryptic but fortunately has comments}}

Most exiles encountered in the main dungeon will turn out to be [[doppelganger]]s, which may temporarily assume the form of an exile.

== Equipment ==

An exile on the Astral Plane will get a [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Scythe|scythe]] as a [[weapon]].  Its [[enchantment]] will be random between  +4 and +8, and it will be either [[erodeproof]] or [[greased]] (but not both) with 33.3% probability each.  There is a 50% chance that it will be made into an [[artifact]], if possible.  The exile will also have an [[elven mithril-coat]] and a [[leather cloak]] for armor.

Like other player monsters on the Astral Plane, exiles will also be equipped with [[d notation|1d3]] random [[offensive item]]s, 1d3 random [[defensive item]]s, 1d3 random [[miscellaneous item]]s, some [[gold]], and a [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]].<ref>{{function|mplayer.c|mk_mplayer}}</ref><ref>[http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pgp/nh/moninvent-343.txt Monsters' Equipment Spoiler] by Boudewijn Waijers, Topi Linkala and Philip Potter</ref>

The '''ancient of ice''' is a slow but powerful [[demon]] in [[dNetHack]]. It has a more powerful variant in the [[ancient of death]].

In addition to a high-damage weapon attack, it uses cold-themed [[monster spell]]s and a [[gaze attack]] that deals [[cold]] damage. When destroyed, it explodes in a freezing blast. Unlike most other demons, ancients of ice will [[Demon#Demon_summoning|summon]] groups of [[nupperibo]]s instead of additional major demons.

Ancients of ice breathe in heat and breathe out cold. If a non-fire-resistant target is within 4 squares of an ancient of ice, the ancient will suck some heat out of it, dealing level/3 d8 damage (i.e., between 5d8 and 10d8). After inhaling heat, if one or more non-cold-resistant targets are within 8 squares and lined up with the ancient, it will exhale a blast of cold breath towards a chosen target. Hostile ancients will target the player character with high priority, unless the character is immune to cold. If the character is not a valid target, the ancient will choose the closest valid target instead.

Tame ancients of ice make powerful pets, in large part due to the rarity of targets able to resist both fire and cold. Additionally, ancients of ice are humanoid (though of large size) and therefore can use all types of equipment. Ancients can reach a maximum of 30th level.

At most 8 ancients of ice will appear per game.
