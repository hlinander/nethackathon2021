The '''Web of the Chosen''' is the [[Drow (starting race)|Drow]] [[Noble]] [[quest artifact]] in [[dNetHack]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Drow Noble quest]], and is [[chaotic]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its [[base item]] is a [[silver]]ed [[droven cloak]].

==Generation==
Unlike most other quest artifacts in dNetHack, the Web is not guarded by the [[quest nemesis]], an [[elder brain]]; it is instead within the hands of the [[mindless]] [[A'gone]], who is imprisoned in a cell on the edge of the goal level.

==Description==
When carried, the Web of the Chosen grants [[shock resistance]]; when worn, it additionally grants [[reflection]], [[half spell damage]], and [[acid resistance]], and doubles the normal AC bonus from its enchantment.

Mind flayers and master mindflayers are moved here from the [[Humanoid (monster class)|humanoid]] monster class ({{white|h}}) primarily to avert the [[YASD]] potential from using a blessed [[scroll of genocide]] on them as a [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarven]] player - this additionally solves the problem of "minesflayers".

The entire level is lit. The shop has a peaceful Barkeep. The {{white|h}} and {{white|H}} are [[statue]]s - only the {{white|H}} is [[historic]].

There are adventurers scattered across the level, who can each be any of the following monsters:

<div style="column-count:3;-moz-column-count:3;-webkit-column-count:3">
* [[apprentice]]
* [[warrior]]
* [[ninja]]
* [[thug]]

* [[acolyte]]

* [[neanderthal]]
* [[chieftain]]

* [[caveman (player monster)|cave dweller]]
* [[barbarian (player monster)|barbarian]]
* [[archeologist (player monster)|archeologist]]
* [[doppelganger]]
</div>

Fifteen of the adventurers are hostile, and ten are peaceful.

Eleven potions of booze are scattered around the level.

The following messages are [[engrave]]d on the floor of level <ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/dat/bar.lua</ref>:

* "Welcome to the bar of disgruntled adventurers!"
* "[[Rodney]] stinks!"
* "Drinking >>>> Questing!"

== Messages ==

{{message|The air is filled with the sound of the clanking of tankards and a raucous bar fight!|You have entered the Bar.}}

== Strategy ==

You will want [[reflection]] when you arrive, as the adventurers are likely to have dangerous wands in their possession.

The bar has a massive amount of potions and wands so it would be ideal to bring a [[bag of holding]]. If you can't manage a bag of holding, at least get a [[sack]] so that you can collect all the loot on the level without running out of inventory space.

The peaceful and hostile adventurers will fight and possibly kill each other. Observe the fights and you can pick up the gear of anyone who dies. To speed up the process and prevent the adventurers from using up their potions, try paralyzing the adventurers or putting them to sleep.

Be careful not to anger the peaceful adventurers or the Barkeep.

== Origin ==

The Bar is inspired by the [[Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers]] from [[SLASH'EM]], and some [[IRC]] discussions.<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/doc/changelog.md</ref>

Asmodeus {{msl|Asmodeus}} and various other monsters are in the positions marked above.

The areas marked "lmr" are lemure pits.

The small room with the [[ring of hunger]] additionally has three major demons and some cursed [[gem]]s:

* a diamond named The Tears of Koth
* a ruby named The Heart of Cassanova
* an emerald named The Eye of Hera

The 1x2 room containing the landmine also has a [[scroll of fire]] and [[scroll of earth]].

The square with the loadstone also has an amulet of strangulation. There is a cursed -2 [[helm of opposite alignment]] on the upstair.

The incubus is on a [[throne]]. In the room with the mimic, the demons in the north-west and south-east corners are standing on [[potion of invisibility|potions of invisibility]].

There are four random pieces of [[armor]], four random [[weapons]], two random [[potion]]s and two random [[scroll]]s scattered about the level.

The room with the [[scroll of elementalism]] has some squares with a single gold coin on them.

All walls are non-diggable.

== Strategy ==

Having a means of opening or demolishing the drawbridges may be useful.

With the possible exception of the helm of opposite alignment, most of the loot on this level is of limited use to a late-game character.

There are likely to be a lot of demons (and perhaps Asmodeus himself) crowded in the 3x4 hallway with the squeaky boards and fire traps. It's a good place to cast an area attack spell such as [[spellbook of psystrike|psystrike]] or [[spellbook of sonicboom|sonicboom]].

* three random [[F|{{gray|F}}]]
* a [[green slime]] named "Glurrz, emissary of [[Juiblex]]"
* two or three random [[P|{{gray|P}}]]

All of the walls are non-diggable. Most of the level is unlit except the area around the upstair.

== Strategy ==

In theory, one could get through the level without a means of crossing water, by walking carefully on the solid floor tiles and opening the drawbridge with a [[wand of opening]]. However that is not necessarily practical.

[[Malcanthet]] {{magenta|&}} stands on the downstair, guarded by a [[succubus]] named Touch, a succubus named Breath and an [[incubus]] named Taste. The building has some random [[nymph|{{white|n}}]] and [[major demon|{{white|&}}]] inside. There are also some random [[sea monster|{{white|;}}]] in the moat and under one of the [[drawbridge]]s.

Additionally, scattered across the level are a succubus, an incubus, five random [[n|{{white|n}}]], a [[baobhan-sith]], a [[wood nymph]], two [[vampire mage]]s, two random monsters, nine random [[object]]s and eight random [[trap]]s.

Outside of the building, [[floor]] tiles have a 20% chance of being replaced with a [[tree]], otherwise they are replaced with [[grass]].<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/dat/foogardens.lua</ref>

The building is unlit, however the rest of the level is lit.

== Strategy ==
It is likely that the vampire mages will summon monsters around you soon after you arrive. Be prepared to fight a crowd: a [[ring of conflict]] may be helpful.

Ranged weapons and spells will probably help you fight the vampire mages, nymphs and foocubi.

The moat is slightly too wide to cross using [[jumping boots]]. If a [[giant]] is generated, it might have a [[boulder]] that you can push into the moat. If not, you will need some other way of crossing the water.

== Map ==
The level is largely composed of [[water]]. Regions of [[ice]] move, disappear and reappear: these represent icebergs. The portal to the [[Plane of Fire]] also moves.

There are eleven [[ice elemental]]s, three [[plasma elemental]]s, one [[air elemental]], one [[water elemental]], two [[red dragon]]s, one [[silver dragon]], one [[white dragon]], two [[energy vortex|energy vortices]], and two [[ice vortex|ice vortices]]: all of them are guaranteed to be hostile. Additionally there are two [[kraken]]s, four random [[sea monster|{{white|;}}]], and twenty other random monsters.

The entire plane is lit. <ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/dat/ice.lua</ref>

== Strategy ==
[[Levitation]] or [[flying]] is best for crossing the water. It is also possible to [[jump]], which can sometimes be useful for escaping nearby monsters.

[[Throne Archon]]s and [[lich|liches]] can be generated on this Plane, see you from far away, and start summoning nasties around you.

'''The Rogue Gear-Spirits''' is the [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomish]] [[Ranger]] [[quest artifact]] in [[dNetHack]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Gnomish Ranger Quest]], and is [[neutral]]-aligned. Its [[base item]] type is a [[crossbow]].

When carried, The Rogue Gear-Spirits confers [[telepathy]], [[warning]] and [[fire resistance]]. When wielded, it grants +1d5 [[to-hit]] and double damage, both to each arrow fired and to any damage it does in melee - when using it as a melee weapon, it is treated as a double-damage [[pick-axe]] that deals piercing and blunt damage. Wielding the artifact additionally confers [[automatic searching]] and adds its enhancement as a bonus to manual [[search]] attempts.

[[Invoking]] The Rogue Gear-Spirits allows you to [[untrap]] an applicable square. [[Firing]] [[crossbow bolt]]s from The Rogue Gear-Spirits will always shoot at least 2 bolts instead of 1; if no ammo is quivered, it will automatically create and fire +0 crossbow bolts. [[Apply]]ing The Rogue Gear-Spirits allows you to dig as with a pick-axe, and each application will cause the artifact to supply a random [[rumor]]; the rumor will be true or false based on the artifact's [[beatitude]].

'''The Crossbow of Carl''' is the [[Gnome (starting race)|Gnomish]] [[Ranger]] [[quest artifact]] in [[EvilHack]]. It is the prize given for completing the [[Ranger quest]] in place of [[The Longbow of Diana]], and is [[chaotic]] for [[wishing]] purposes. Its [[base item]] type is a [[bow]].

The Crossbow of Carl has almost the exact same traits as the Longbow of Diana: when carried, it confers [[telepathy]]; when wielded, it confers [[reflection]] and grants a +d5 to-hit bonus and +d6 damage bonus to [[crossbow bolt]]s [[firing|fired]] from it; and [[invoking]] the Crossbow creates bolts with the same [[beatitude]] as the bow, with a small chance of producing [[poisoned]] bolts. As with the Longbow, beatitude also influences the amount of bolts created with each invoke, with a blessed Crossbow creating more bolts and a cursed Crossbow creating fewer.

The '''ichneumon larva''' and '''giant ichneumon''' are monsters in [[SpliceHack]].

The giant ichneumon has an attack that can inject you with larva that eventually burst out of your body.

When the larva burst out, they will initially do 1d5 damage, plus damage equal to half your current HP. If the 1d5 damage kills you, your epitaph will explain that you were "eaten alive from the inside by insects".<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/src/timeout.c#L620</ref>

If you have been injected with larva, you can prevent the bursting from occurring by quaffing a [[potion of sickness]]<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/src/potion.c#L1064</ref> or casting the [[spell of cure sickness]]<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/src/spell.c#L1304</ref>.

== History ==
Early versions of SpliceHack had [[brood wasp]]s, which had slightly different abilities. Brood wasps were replaced with ichneumon in SpliceHack 1.0.0.<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.0.0-R/doc/changelog.md#monster-changes</ref>

== Origin ==
There are real-life parasitic insects called ichneumon wasps. They are a diverse group including 25,000 described species.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
These insects are feared for their ability to lay eggs inside
the bodies of their prey.</poem>}}
