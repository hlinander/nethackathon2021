The '''orcish shield''' is a kind of [[shield]]. When unidentified, it is a '''red-eyed shield'''.

Since Mordor orcs tend to be less dangerous than Uruk-hai, especially because of the [[poisoned]] arrows used by the latter, one might expect the orcish shield to be inferior, but in practice the two shields are identical in all but name and appearance.

==Generation==
Orcish shields are usually found on [[Mordor orc]]s (with a 2/3 chance).{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|406|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} [[Orc-captain]]s may also get an orcish shield or an [[Uruk-hai shield]], with about a 1/3 chance of each.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|400|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Mythology==
The red eye is the symbol of Sauron, the title character and main antagonist of ''The Lord of the Rings'', whose forces included armies of [[orc (monster class)|orc]]s.

==Strategy==
{{main|Shield#Strategy}}
This is worse than almost any other shield due to its low armor class and high weight. The orcish shield is mainly useful for role-playing, and for the [[unofficial conduct#Racial|racial armor unofficial conduct]].

==UnNetHack==
Orcish shields are considered [[racial equipment]] for [[orc (starting race)|orc]]s, for purposes of the racial [[AC]] bonus in [[UnNetHack]]{{refsrc|include/obj.h|216|unnethack=1986}}.

The '''large shield''' is a kind of [[shield]].

== Generation ==

Large shields are normally found on [[watchman|watchmen]] and [[soldier|soldiers]].

== Strategy ==
{{main|Shield#Strategy}}
Large shields are rarely used by adventurers. The identical [[dwarvish roundshield]] is common in the Gnomish Mines. The better shields in the game include the [[small shield]], [[elven shield]] and [[shield of reflection]].

The '''dwarvish roundshield''' is a type of [[shield]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It grants 2 [[AC]] when worn, and appears as a '''large round shield''' when unidentified.

==Generation==
Dwarvish roundshields are commonly found on well-equipped [[dwarf (monster)|dwarves]], especially in the [[Gnomish Mines]].

==Strategy==
{{main|Shield#Strategy}}
The dwarvish roundshield is likely to be the first 2 AC shield the player finds. It is very heavy compared to most shields and provides no special properties, so it is typically swapped for a lighter shield (such as a [[small shield]], [[shield of reflection]], or [[elven shield]]) as soon as possible.

==History==
The dwarvish roundshield first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

While "amoeboid" is not itself a [[monster class]], all amoeboids belong to one of two [[monster class]]es: {{monclass|P}} or {{monclass|b}}.

==Common traits==
{{Wikipedia|Ooze (Dungeons & Dragons)}}
Amoeboids correspond to the "ooze" creature type in Dungeons & Dragons, lacking recognizable body features like heads and limbs. They are [[mindless]] and [[Eyeless|have no eyes]], yet have no apparent trouble sensing the player's location. All amoeboids are [[breathless]].

Many amoeboids are made of substances that can [[Erosion|rust, corrode, or rot]] adventurers' equipped weapons or armor by means of active and [[passive attack]]s.  The green slime can go one step further and turn adventurers themselves into [[Sliming|slime]]. While the gelatinous cube by itself cannot seriously harm adventurers or their equipment, its [[paralysis]] attacks and its appetite for anything made of [[organic]] material&mdash;comestibles, scrolls, spellbooks, armor made of wood or leather, and so on&mdash;make it no less of a nuisance to players.

The acid blob and all puddings are [[amorphous]], so they can pass under closed [[door]]s. Quivering blobs and gelatinous cubes apparently have enough of a definite shape that they cannot.

==Remains==
All blobs leave remains that are considered [[vegan]].

All members of the pudding class (including the gray ooze and green slime) leave [[glob]]s instead of corpses. Like corpses, globs can be [[eat]]en and cause [[food poisoning]] if they become [[tainted]]. Unlike corpses, globs cannot be [[sacrifice]]d or revived by [[Wand of undead turning|undead turning]]. All globs are [[flesh]]y, so eating them violates the [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] [[conduct]]s; since puddings no longer leave corpses, they will never leave random [[death drop]]s.

All amoeboids, with the exception of the quivering blob, have [[acid]]ic bodies, so they resist [[petrification]]; their corpses can also be eaten by the player to save them from stoning.

==History==
Globs were added in [[NetHack 3.6.0]] as a countermeasure against [[pudding farming]]. In variants based on older versions, puddings may still drop corpses.

==Encyclopedia entry==
"Blob", "pudding", and "ooze" share the same entry:

{{encyclopedia|<poem>
These giant amoeboid creatures look like nothing more than puddles of slime, but they both live and move, feeding on metal or wood as well as the occasional dungeon explorer to supplement their diet.

But we were not on a station platform.  We were on the track ahead as the nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and driving before it a spiral, re-thickening cloud of the pallid abyss vapor.  It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster than any subway train -- a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.

The '''gray ooze''', {{monsym|gray_ooze}}, is a weak [[amoeboid]] [[NetHack]] monster.  It is extremely slow, but its bite causes [[rust]]ing and can damage [[iron]] armor if it manages to land an attack. 

As an [[acid]]ic monster, the gray ooze is capable of dissolving a [[spider]] [[web]]. Unlike [[Brown pudding|brown]] and [[black pudding]]s, it will not divide when you hit it without killing it.

Like all [[pudding]]s, gray oozes leave a [[glob]] instead of a corpse. This can be eaten like a corpse, and may become tainted, but never fully rots away. The glob is acidic and has a chance of conveying [[Fire resistance|fire]], [[Cold resistance|cold]], or [[Poison resistance|poison]] resistance.

== Strategy ==
By the time you encounter a gray ooze, you should be more than capable of defeating it easily, unless you are a [[Tourist]]. Its rusting attack and ability to pass under doors makes this monster more annoying than dangerous. 

It's best to take gray oozes out with ranged attacks as they are very slow, if not persistent. If you lack the means to kill it from afar and don't want to expend a wand's charge on it, let your pet deal with it. If all else fails, you could punch it to death after unequipping all iron equipment. Only do this if it is safe to do so, i.e. there aren't any other monsters nearby.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier, gray oozes left a corpse instead of a glob when killed.

In NetHack 3.6.0, globs could not give resistances when eaten. This was fixed in 3.6.1.

The '''Nazgul''', {{monsym|Nazgul}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. They share the [[life drain]]ing ability of other [[wraith (monster class)|wraiths]], and they can also breathe dangerous [[sleep]]ing gas. The Nazgul is not a valid form for [[polymorph]].

==Generation==
Nazgul are [[Monster starting inventory|are generated with]] [[cursed]] [[ring of invisibility|rings of invisibility]], and also receive a [[knife]] and [[long sword]], similar to the [[barrow wight]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|472|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|720|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} They become [[extinct]] after nine of them have been generated.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1427|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

A player killed by a Nazgul may appear as a [[wraith]] instead of a [[ghost]] in their [[bones]] file.

==Strategy==
The sleeping gas can catch some players off-guard if they lack sleep resistance, allowing the Nazgul to close in and attack mercilessly, likely resulting in drained levels or even a quick death.

Many souvenir hunters #[[name]] the Nazgul's rings and attempt to ascend with a set of all nine.

==History==
The Nazgul first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]] as one of many monsters who presence could be toggled with the TOLKIEN [[compile-time option]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Nazgûl}}
The Nazgûl (from Black Speech nazg, "ring", and gûl, "wraith, spirit") are derived from the world of Middle-earth created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. They are introduced as "Black Riders" and also called Ringwraiths, Dark Riders, the Nine Riders, or simply the Nine. They were originally nine mortal humans who had succumbed to Sauron's power through wearing Rings of Power, which gave them immortality at the cost of reducing them to invisible wraiths bound to the power of the One Ring and completely under Sauron's control; this is the basis for the cursed rings of invisibility they spawn with in ''NetHack'', as well as why only nine ever generate in a given game.

In their early forays, Nazgûl rode on black horses, and they later ride flying monsters that Tolkien described as "pterodactylic". They used fear as their main weapon, though they have also been seen carrying ordinary swords as well as Morgul-knives that reduce their victims to wraiths (hence why players slain by Nazgûl in ''NetHack'' arise as wraiths.

==Variants==
Many variants grant the Nazgul additional traits derived from the works of Tolkien that they appeared in, including their mutual [[grudge]] against [[hobbits]] from Nephi's grudge patch.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Nazgul can [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|hit as a +2 weapon]], and [[Monsters with need +x weapon to hit (SLASH'EM)|require a +1 weapon to hit]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], the Nazgul a short-ranged [[screaming attack]] that [[stun]]s you if you are close enough to one. Nazgul will attack any [[hobbit]]s they see, and vice versa.

Players killed by a Nazgul will instead arise as a [[barrow wight]] if a bones file is created.

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], Nazgul also have a mutual grudge against hobbits; the range of their scream attack covers the entire level, making them a prime target for [[genocide]].

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], Nazgul and hobbits will attack each other.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], Nazgul have a screaming attack, and Nazgul and hobbits will also attack each other.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Nazgul are made stronger and generate riding [[fell beast]]s as steeds, which are dangerous creatures in their own right; a Nazgul's scream can also shatter any glass objects in open inventory that have not been [[fixed]]. Nazgul and hobbits will also attack each other.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo.

The '''tiger''', {{monsym|tiger}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is the most powerful of the [[feline]]s, possessing two claw attacks and a moderately powerful bite, but is slower than most of its monster class.

Eating certain types of [[food]] while [[hallucinating]] and [[polymorph]]ed into a tiger results in [[YAFM]].

==Generation==
Tigers are significantly rare to encounter as randomly generated monsters, and generally start appearing once you progress past the beginning stages of the dungeon - this includes the [[Gnomish Mines]], within or past [[Minetown]].

==Strategy==
Tigers move at the same speed as an unhasted, unburdened [[player]] - this makes them somewhat easier to avoid compared to faster felines, and its lack of [[magic resistance (monster)|MR score]] renders it very vulnerable to magic. Its attacks can still be dangerous to an unprepared or unlucky adventurer, but a modertately armored and/or well equipped one can dispatch it without much trouble

==History==
The tiger first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.6]].

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Tiger}}
The tiger (''Panthera tigris'') is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera - it is most recognisable by its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. Tigers are apex predators that primarily prey on ungulates such as deer and wild boar; they are territorial and generally solitary, but social predators. The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758, and is among the most recognizable and popular of the world's megafauna; it is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

Tigers were once widespread over much of Asia's landmass some centuries ago; today, the tiger is an endangered species due to habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, poaching, and human–wildlife conflict. Its habitat range stretches from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra. Tigers featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, with many symbolic depictions continuing to the modern day.

==Messages==
{{message|This <[[foo]]> is gr-r-reat!|You were hallucinating while polymorphed into a tiger and ate meat (such as a [[corpse]]).{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1717|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}}}

==Variants==
Some variants change the tiger's glyph to make room for any new feline monsters that the variant introduces.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], tigers can appear in [[Special room (SLASH'EM)|'real' zoos]], and can also be summoned by [[Werecreature (SLASH'EM)|weretigers]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], tigers replace [[bugbear]]s as the first [[quest]] monster for the [[Caveman quest]].

===dNetHack===
In [[dNethack]], the tiger's glyph is red rather than yellow ({{red|f}}).

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, several tigers are generated on the creation of levels beyond the home floor of the Caveman quest.

The '''gargoyle''', {{monsym|gargoyle}}, is a [[thick-skinned]] [[humanoid]] monster that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is one of the few monsters immune to [[stoning]] that is neither [[acidic]] nor itself capable of stoning.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|071d79dce2ad5b8ade17c4dedf6b57c18b273a59}}, temporary stoning resistance can be granted by eating gargoyle corpses. You get the message '''You feel less concerned about becoming petrified.''' when you gain temporary stoning resistance and '''You no longer feel secure from petrification.''' when the temporary resistance expires.}}

==Generation==
Gargoyles are somewhat uncommon, and will begin appearing around the middle of the dungeon. They can also hatch from {{frac|76|77}} of [[egg]]s [[Oviparous|laid by other gargoyles]] and [[winged gargoyle]]s.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|3914|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Gargoyles cannot [[grow up]] into winged gargoyles, however.

==Strategy==
A gargoyle can hit fairly hard with its bite and two claw attacks, and has a natural AC of -4, which may result in death for adventurers who fail to take it seriously. They are somewhat slow at 10 speed, however, and have absolutely no [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]], making them very vulnerable to wands and spells.

As a pet and [[polyself]] form, gargoyles are somewhat decent - they are [[strong]], [[breathless]] and [[inediate]], their immunity to stoning makes dispatching [[cockatrice]]s easy, and they are capable of wearing all armor.

==History==
The gargoyle first appears in [[SLASH 6]], and is introduced to vanilla ''NetHack'' in [[NetHack 3.2.0]].

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Gargoyle}}
{{Wikipedia|Gargoyles (TV film)}}
A gargoyle is a semi-decorative figure carved from stone and primarily associated with medieval and Gothic architecture, though the concept of animal-shaped water diversions existed centuries prior. The term originates from the French ''"gargouille"'', which in English roughly means "throat" or "gullet"; its root is the Latin ''"gar"'' ("to swallow"), which represents the gurgling sound of water. Gargoyles are specifically employed in order to divide the flow of rainwater and direct it away from the sides of a building - a trough is cut in the back of a gargoyle, and the rainwater typically exits through the open mouth, preventing it from eroding the mortar between masonry walls; such gargoyles are typically given elongated forms to achieve the desired distance from the wall, and may optionally be given wings as well.

Mythical gargoyles are directly based on the carved stone figures, and have been conceived as animated statues or living statue-like being similar to golems; some works depict them as beings of demonic affinity, e.g. the 1972 television film ''[[wikipedia:Gargoyles (TV film)|Gargoyles]]'' that provides their [[encyclopedia]] entry, or else vessels for demonic possession, as in the popular 1984 movie ''[[wikipedia:Ghostbusters|Ghostbusters]]''. The concept of the gargoyle as a guardian partly derives from the French legend of a dragon-like monster called Gargouille (or Goji), which was subdued or captured by [[wikipedia:Romanus of Rouen|Romanus of Rouen]] with the aid of either a crucifix or a condemned man that acted as the sole volunteer. The monster is led back to Rouen and burned, with its head and neck preserved due to being tempered by the fire breath; the head was mounted on the walls of the newly built church as a ward for protection and scaring off evil spirits.

==Variants==

In [[SLASH'EM]], gargoyles are the only "stony" monsters immune to the rays from a [[wand of digging]] or the [[spell of dig]], unlike other stony monsters such as the closely-related [[statue gargoyle]].

[[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppelganger]]s that reach experience level 6 can reliably #[[Doppelganger (starting_race)#Polyself|youpoly]] into gargoyles to take advantage of their innate strength and stoning resistance. Tamed gargoyles have a chance to turn [[traitor]] unless you have more HP than them.

In [[UnNetHack]], chatting to a tame gargoyle will cause it to ask "if you've seen Elisa Maza"; this is a reference to the popular Disney animated series [[wikipedia:Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.

The '''winged gargoyle''', {{monsym|winged gargoyle}}, is a [[thick-skinned]] [[humanoid]] [[monster]] in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is a stronger version of the [[gargoyle]], and is among the few monsters immune to [[stoning]] to be neither [[acidic]] nor capable of stoning other monsters.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|071d79dce2ad5b8ade17c4dedf6b57c18b273a59}}, temporary stoning resistance can be granted by eating winged gargoyle corpses. You get the message '''You feel less concerned about becoming petrified.''' when you gain temporary stoning resistance and '''You no longer feel secure from petrification.''' when the temporary resistance expires.}}

==Generation==
Winged gargoyles are even more rare than normal gargoyles, and will often begin appearing once you are around the double-digits in dungeon depth and [[experience level]]. Winged gargoyles are also [[oviparous]] - however, only {{frac|77}} of [[egg]]s laid by other [[gargoyles]] and winged gargoyles will hatch into winged gargoyles themselves.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|3914|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Gargoyles cannot [[grow up]] into winged gargoyles.

==Strategy==
Winged gargoyles have two claw attacks and a bite like normal gargoyles, but gain an additional hitdie, and their slightly worse [[AC]] of -2 is more than offset by the higher damage and 15 [[speed]]. Wands and spells can be effective, especially if you lack the speed and good weapons or AC to deal with one - like normal gargoyles, winged gargoyles lack [[Magic resistance (monster)|a magic resistance score]], but should still be taken down quickly; a [[wand of slow monster]] can bring them down to a similar speed level as their wing-less kin.

As a [[pet]] and polyform, while winged gargoyles are faster and generally stronger than normal gargoyles, their wings make them unable to wear body armor and limit their ability to obtain useful intrinsics and [[MC]]. Winged gargoyles are still quite useful in this regard, being [[strong]] and [[inediate]] as well as [[breathless]], and their stoning resistance is valuable against monsters such as [[cockatrice]]s.

==History==
The winged gargoyle first appears in [[NetHack 3.2.0]].

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Gargoyle}}
{{Wikipedia|Gargoyles (TV film)}}
Gargoyles are semi-decorative figures carved from stone and primarily associated with medieval and Gothic architecture, though the concept of animal-shaped water diversions existed centuries prior.

Mythical gargoyles are usually depicted as winged and are directly based on the carved stone figures - some fiction featuring them presents them as animated statues or living statue-like being similar to golems, while others depict them as beings of demonic affinity, e.g. the 1972 television film ''[[wikipedia:Gargoyles (TV film)|Gargoyles]]'' that provides their [[encyclopedia]] entry; still others consider them as vessels for demonic possession, as in the popular 1984 movie ''[[wikipedia:Ghostbusters|Ghostbusters]]''.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], a [[statue trap]] with a winged gargoyle [[statue]] appears on the outskirts of [[Grund's Stronghold]].

[[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppelganger]]s that reach experience level 9 can reliably #[[Doppelganger (starting_race)#Polyself|youpoly]] into winged gargoyles to take advantage of their innate strength and stoning resistance, as with normal gargoyles - a decision between the forms ultimately comes down to whether you value natural speed and higher damage versus body armor slots.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], winged gargoyles can appear among the court of a [[vampire lord]]-ruled [[Special room (dNetHack)#Throne room (throne occupied)|throne room]].

&&%s&& %s NetHack units {137296 2021-01-19T02:26:21Z {4001476 Infinigon} restore mistakenly removed offset=1 Many have tried to convert '''NetHack units''' of measurement to a scale that would more or less correlate with real life. This attempt uses metabolism as the transition factor. The result was approximately 7.5 seconds per turn, which seems to be within proper degrees of magnitude. The translated NetHack time will be called '''Correlated NetHack Time''', or '''CNT'''.

==Calculation==
According to the [[guidebook]], divine intervention was certainly sufficient to influence sleep of the chosen hero ("Strange dreams... haunted you in your sleep"). Therefore, it can be extrapolated that whilst in the dungeon (or [[Gehennom]]), magical or divine influence allows the hero to not require regular sleep. This explains why no occurrences of mandatory sleep occur throughout the game.

Assuming, then, that the hero hacks continuously, and that hacking is hard work, the hero's caloric consumption can be calculated. Averaging the energy spent during combat and the energy spent leisurely exploring, the estimated caloric consumption is likely equivalent to that of a brisk walk for a human of 80 kg, or around '''400 Cal/hour'''. (Note that the capital letter is significant here; 1 Calorie ('''1 Cal''') is equal to 1000 calories ('''1000 cal''') or 1 kilocalorie ('''1 kcal''').<ref>[[wikipedia:Calorie]]</ref>)

 Hero consumes <math>400\text{ Cal}/\text{h}</math> continuously (no sleep).

===Computation via food rations===

Since [[food ration]]s are frequently in the hero's inventory from the start, it can be safely assumed that food rations are not magical products, but designed for normal mortal [[human (starting race)|human]]s to eat three times daily with a daily consumption of 2000 Cal / day.

 <math>\frac{2000\text{ Cal}/\text{day}}{3\text{ rations}/\text{day}} = 667\text{ Cal}/\text{ration}</math>

Because the hero burns through food rations faster than normal humans, each ration can sustain the hero for a much shorter time.

 <math>\frac{667\text{ Cal}/\text{ration}}{400\text{ Cal}/\text{h}} = 1.\overline{6}\ \text{h}/\text{ration}</math>

In NetHack, one ration supplies 800 nutritional points, which lasts 800 turns in standard hacking conditions. Therefore,
 <math>\frac{800\text{ turns}/\text{ration}}{1.\overline{6}\text{ h}/\text{ration}} = 480\text{ turns}/\text{h}</math>

 <math>\frac{3600\text{ s}/\text{h}}{480\text{ turns}/\text{h}} = 7.5\text{ s}/\text{turn}</math>

===Alternate computation via eggs===

Just how big is a food ration intended to be? The game doesn't really say. One may wish to avoid making assumptions on such an ill-described comestible. If we're after a nutritional reference point in the real world, it makes more sense to use the [[egg]] instead.

An average hen egg contains 66 Calories, which would sustain our hero for just a few minutes:

 <math>\frac{66\text{ Cal}/\text{egg}}{400\text{ Cal}/\text{h}} = 9.9\ \text{minute}/\text{egg}</math>

In NetHack, a non-monster egg (which we assume is an ordinary hen egg) supplies 80 nutrition points, which lasts 80 turns:

 <math>\begin{align}
 \frac{80\text{ turns}/\text{egg}}{9.9\text{ minute}/\text{egg}}
  &\approx 8\text{ turns}/\text{minute} \\
  &= 480\text{ turns}/\text{h} \\
 \end{align}
 </math>

Which is the same conclusion as we arrived at above.

==Extrapolations==
With this core value of '''7.5 seconds/turn''' in mind, one can calculate the scale of magnitude of other values in the NetHack world.

An average ascension is 50000 turns, this means that:
 <math>(50000\text{ turns}/\text{ascension})(7.5\text{ s}/\text{turn})\left (\frac{1\text{ day}}{86400\text{ s}}\right ) \approx 4.34\text{ days}/\text{ascension} </math>

4 days and 8 hours of NetHack time seems reasonable for an ascension.

A human walks at approximately 5 km/hour. This means that one NetHack tile is:
 <math>(5\text{ km}/\text{h}) \left( \frac{5\text{ h}\cdot \text{m}}{18\text{ km}\cdot \text{s}} \right) (7.5\text{ s}/\text{tile}) \approx 10.4\text{ m}/\text{tile}</math>

This seems reasonable, as a [[dragon]] has to fit into one. 

A dungeon level's dimension limits are roughly 78&times;20 varying a little between levels (80&times;25 minus borders and status lines). This means a dungeon is approximately 810 m by 210 m (roughly, 1/2 mi by 1/8 mi).

Assuming the stairs have an inclination of 45 degrees, the ceiling can be guessed to be about 7 meters high. This result can be found using the Pythagorean theorem <code>a^2&nbsp;+&nbsp;b^2&nbsp;=&nbsp;c^2</code>, setting <code>c&nbsp;=&nbsp;10.4&nbsp;m</code> and <code>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;b</code> and solving <code>a</code>:

 <math>\lfloor \sqrt{\frac{(10.4\text{ m})^2}{2}} \rfloor = 7\text{ m}</math>

==Results==
The Hero:
*... consumes '''400 Cal/hour''' continuously (no sleep).
*... takes '''7.5 seconds''' to experience one NetHack turn.
*... ascends in '''4 days and 8 hours''' of '''Correlated NetHack Time (CNT)''' on average.
** Maud's record fast ascension took '''4 hours, 26 minutes and 52.5 seconds CNT'''.
*... eats a full meal every '''1 hour 40 minutes CNT'''.
*... forgets spells about every '''42 hours CNT''' (no sleep, remember?).
Also:
* A NetHack tile is approximately '''10.4 m &times; 10.4 m &times; 7 m (34.1 ft. &times; 34.1 ft. &times; 23.0 ft.)''', or '''760 m&sup3; (26&nbsp;740 ft.&sup3;)'''.
* Dungeon dimensions are approximately '''810 m &times; 210 m (1/2 mi. &times; 1/8 mi.)'''.
* The Plane of Water contains about '''1.18 billion liters (312 million gallons) of water''', weighing '''1.18 million metric tons'''.
*[[You]] can throw a [[zorkmid]] up to '''52 m (170.6 ft)''' away.
*[[Moloch's Sanctum]] can be as deep as '''360 m (1181.1 ft)''' below ground.

&&%s&& %s Nethack.alt.org weekly scorefest {144308 2022-02-02T11:24:31Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  A '''scorefest''' is a competition where players strive to acquire as high a score as possible with new characters within the given time limit. The basic idea was suggested by Hours. At midnight to 00:30 EST on October 2, 2006, the first test scorefest was held on [[nethack.alt.org]] and coordinated on #nethack in the former [[Freenode]] network by [[User:Eidolos|Eidolos]] and [[User:SGrunt|Grunt]].  The event proved to be a success, and the event has evolved into the '''weekly scorefest'''.

==Rules==
# The starting time and ending time will be determined in advance. In #nethack we use [[Rodney (bot)|Rodney]]'s !time command.
# No games can be started before the starting time; this entails not pressing 'p' on the dgamelaunch menu until the appointed time.
# Your character must die, [[quit]], [[escape]], [[ascend]] or otherwise end the game before the ending time. Rodney should report the score.
# You can play (and [[startscum]]) as many games as you want between the starting time and ending time; any games must meet the above criteria to be scored.
# The highest score achieved in a single game that meets the above criteria shall be considered the winner.  In the event of a tie, the game with the lower turn count shall prevail.
# By agreement of the majority of players present for the competition, additional restrictions may be declared for the current round of games (for example, everyone must play random characters, or all [[Healer]]s, etc.).  Votes for restrictions must be concluded no later than 10 minutes before the starting time.
# When a score is called into question, the ttyrecs for the game shall be investigated to ensure the timestamps are consistent with the above criteria.

'''Leather gloves''', known as '''yugake''' to [[Samurai]], are the most basic kind of [[gloves]].

==Generation ==

Monks start with a +2 pair of leather gloves, and [[healers]] start with a +1 pair.

== Identification ==

Leather gloves can be easily [[price identification|price-identified]] because they cost much less than the other gloves with [[randomized appearance]].  Martial [[role]]s such as [[barbarian]]s, [[knight]]s, [[monk]]s, [[samurai]], and [[valkyrie]]s start the game with this item already identified. 

==Strategy==

Acquisition of some kind of gloves or gauntlets is a key middle-game objective, as wearing something on your hands prevents a number of [[cockatrice]]-related deaths (walking over a corpse while blind, attacking a live cockatrice without a wielded weapon, etc.).

Leather gloves are a good candidate for early [[enchant armor]] scrolls because they are unlikely to be replaced at that point, and cannot be destroyed by a [[polymorph trap]].

==Encyclopedia entry (for yugake)==

Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.

'''Iron shoes''' are a type of non-magical [[boots]] that appear in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are naturally made of [[iron]], and appear as '''hard shoes''' when unidentified. When worn, they grant 2 [[AC]].

==Generation==
[[Dwarves]] have a {{frac|6|7}} chance of [[monster starting inventory|generating with]] iron shoes in [[Monster starting inventory|their inventory]];{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|370|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} [[Uruk-hai]] have a {{frac|3}} chance to generate with iron shoes.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|417|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Iron boots and [[high boots]] are the only kinds of boots to have a natural AC of 2; iron shoes are much easier to find, particularly in the [[Gnomish Mines]], but weigh more and incur a [[spellcasting]] penalty. They are additionally vulnerable to [[Erosion|rusting]], which among other things can make encounters with [[rust monster]]s annoying.

In the early phases of the game, melee roles with limited or no interest in spells and casters looking to prioritize AC will likely grab one of the many pairs of iron shoes they encounter in the mines, and may swap them for lighter high boots if deemed necessary.

'''High boots''' are a set of non-magical [[boots]] found in [[Nethack]]. They are made of [[leather]], and appear as '''jackboots''' when unidentified. They grant 2 base [[AC]] when worn.

==Generation==
Many [[mercenaries]] [[Monster starting inventory|are often generated with high boots]].

==Strategy==
High boots are the only 2 AC boots that do not interfere with [[spellcasting]], and are suitable for wear until the player finds their desired pair of magical boots. [[Elven boots]] can be safely enchanted to +7 for 1 more point of AC compared to +5 high boots; [[speed boots]] and [[jumping boots]] are also frequent replacements, especially for [[ascension kit]]s, and can be [[polypile]]d from enchanted elven boots.

==History==
High boots are introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the [[Yeoman]]'s starting inventory always contains a pair of high boots.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarvish]] [[Binder (dNetHack role)|Binders]] start with a +0 pair of burnt high boots.

===Pirate Patch===
In [[SlashTHEM]] and dNetHack, high boots are included in the [[Pirate]] starting inventory. The [[pirate brother]]s and [[Mayor Cummerbund]] in their [[quest]] will also be generated with high boots, as are the [[wandering pirate|wandering skeletal and gityanki pirates]] players encounter within and elsewhere.

===Noble Patch===
The [[Rebel Ringleader]], the default [[quest nemesis]] for [[Noble]]s in dNetHack, is generated with high boots.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], [[Giant (starting race)|giant]] [[Infidel]]s, [[Monk]]s and [[Priest]]s have the body armor in their starting inventories replaced with a pair of +1 high boots. [[User:Tomsod/YANIs and patches/Infidel/Quest#The Paladin|The Paladin]], the [[Infidel]] quest nemesis, is also generated with high boots among her suite of armor.

===The November NetHack Tournament===
In [[The November NetHack Tournament]], the [[Devteam member]]s found in [[The DevTeam Office|their office]] have high boots among their starting armor.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
In Fantasyland these are remarkable in that they seldom or
never wear out and are suitable for riding or walking in
without the need of Socks.  Boots never pinch, rub, or get
stones in them; nor do nails stick upwards into the feet from
the soles.  They are customarily mid-calf length or knee-high,
slip on and off easily and never smell of feet.  Unfortunately,
the formula for making this splendid footwear is a closely
guarded secret, possibly derived from nonhumans (see Dwarfs,
Elves, and Gnomes).

'''Water walking boots''' are a pair of [[magical item|magical]] [[boots]] that appear in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
A guaranteed pair of water walking boots is found within one of the niches on the middle level of [[Vlad's Tower]].

==Description==
When worn, water walking boots provide 1 AC and allow the wearer to [[water walking|walk on water]]; they can also be used to cross [[lava]], but ''must'' be [[fireproof]]ed first, as trying with non-fireproof boots will destroy them and probably plunge you into the lava. Water walking boots have no impact on a [[steed]]'s ability to cross water, and cannot be used to traverse the [[Plane of Water]].

==Strategy==
Water walking lets you cross [[moat]]s and pools safely, similar to [[levitation]] sources such as the [[ring of levitation|ring]] or [[levitation boots|boots]]. However, they will ''not'' protect you against [[Holding attack#Drowning attack|drowning attacks]], nor will they protect you or your inventory from fire damage while crossing.

While the ring of levitation is easier to manage and generally preferred, water walking boots are still a more manageable method of crossing water compared to levitation boots - they do not cause you to break contact with the ground, so you can freely pick up items on land and walk down stairs without removing anything. If planning to cross over lava, be sure to have [[fire resistance]] to avoid sustaining damage, and fireproof as many other vulnerable items in your inventory as you can.

Water walking also allows for unlimited #[[dip]]ping [[scroll]]s and [[spellbook]]s into water tiles to blank them, or diluting [[potion]]s for {{! of|water}} production - while falling into water is normally faster, it is also reliant on your [[Luck]]. Having access to water walking can also save time and even [[wish]]es in these cases, as you may be able to put off obtaining a source of sustained levitation until the [[Elemental Planes]]. Be '''especially careful''' around [[foocubi]] and [[nymph]]s while on top of water or lava!

The [[Castle]], [[Juiblex's Swamp]] and [[Medusa's Island]] are common levels where these boots are used, as well as the [[Quest]] for certain roles (e.g., the [[Healer]] [[Healer quest|quest]]). Some players keep them on routinely to reduce water-crossing hassles, particularly from forgetting to use levitation or else moving off dry land due to typos.

Players crafting [[ascension kit]]s tend to forego these boots in favor of [[speed boots]] and [[jumping boots]], which are typically supplemented with a ring or [[potion of levitation|potions of levitation]] - for those who do not have either types of boots and do not want to [[wish]] for them, water walking boots are an excellent choice. If you have not found ''any'' of these boots by the time you reach the Castle, a pair of unenchanted [[high boots]] or [[elven boots]] can suffice until you reach the middle of Vlad's Tower or find another preferable pair.

===Identification===
Water walking boots are non-trivial to identify, as they don't display a message when worn and have no obvious effects, unlike [[speed boots]] and [[jumping boots]]; [[price identification]] is one of the more reliable methods, as it poses no risk to your inventory.

If you cannot price-ID, the simplest way to test boots for water walking is to remove and drop any scrolls, spellbooks, potions, and rustable equipment first (or place it into an [[oilskin sack]]), then step into a water tile - unless your [[encumbrance]] is high, you will safely climb back out if the boots are not water walking. A safer and more difficult option is to use [[teleport control]], since water squares will be considered "safe" if you teleport onto a water tile while wearing water walking boots, you can teleport onto a water tile and stand safely there; if not, you will be teleported elsewhere in the level at random.

==History==
Water walking boots first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the presence of the [[create pool]] [[monster spell]] makes it vital that some players keep a means of staying above water on hand at all times, particularly on the [[ascension run]]. Water walking boots are among the more ideal options for ascension kits as a result.
