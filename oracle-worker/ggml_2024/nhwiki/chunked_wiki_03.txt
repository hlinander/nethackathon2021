{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|These numbers are slightly different because an off-by-one error which slightly biased strength over charisma was fixed in {{commit|7d140c6a70a11142d001526cdccc484132a30a59|this commit}}.

Also, some role intrinsics have changed, since {{commit|075c2832a1145ff3dc0049f2cfa6f3b86352179e}}:
*Archeologists now start with searching, get stealth at XL 5, and speed at XL 10.

Some other games, such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' use the word "class", and ''[[wikipedia:MapleStory|MapleStory]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy]]'', for example, use "job", while NetHack always calls them roles.

&&%s&& %s Artifact {147128 2022-08-02T03:18:24Z {4001595 Bruceleroy99} add link to Slash'THEM artifacts page list An '''artifact''' is a rare and unique object with special properties not found on mundane items. No more than one of any given artifact will ever be generated in a given game; even if the original is destroyed, another cannot be made.

Every artifact is an object of a "base" type with a specific name. For example, Excalibur is a long sword named "Excalibur", and the Orb of Fate is a crystal ball named "The Orb of Fate". This is why attempting to create an artifact by giving it the appropriate name, or changing an existing artifact's name, always fails, and was the source of the [[naming artifacts]] bug.

Artifacts have their own opinions on who is fit to handle them, and may [[artifact blast|react violently]] to adventurers who don't meet their standards. [[Intelligent artifact]]s are especially picky, and will refuse to cooperate at all with those they deem unworthy.

[[Shopkeeper]]s like to rip off adventurers who buy or sell artifacts.  They charge four times normal price for them,{{refsrc|shk.c|2008|nethack=3.6.0}} but only pay a fourth of the normal selling price for them.{{refsrc|shk.c|3118|nethack=3.6.0}} Thus, one should use a [[pet]] to steal any artifacts generated in shops, and never sell them unless desperate for cash.

== Generation ==
Randomly-generated weapons have a 5% chance of being made an artifact,{{refsrc|mkobj.c|762|nethack=3.6.0}} provided an artifact of the base type exists and is eligible for generation. Quest artifacts can't be generated this way.

An artifact weapon is a possible reward for [[sacrifice]]. Some [[role]]s have a particular artifact specified, which will always be the first one granted this way if it hasn't already been generated. Otherwise, you can receive any artifact eligible for random generation which doesn't contradict your [[alignment]]. [[Crowning]] may also grant an alignment-dependent artifact weapon. The choice of potential artifact gifts is an important factor in choosing your character's alignment if you're not pursuing the [[atheist]] [[conduct]].

Each role has a [[quest artifact]] associated with it. The one corresponding to your role will always be generated in the possession of your [[quest nemesis]], and never anywhere else.

[[Wish]]ing is an option if you want a specific artifact that you aren't likely to get by other means, such as another role's quest artifact. There's a possibility of not getting your wish, however.

[[Bones]] levels may contain artifacts. Any artifact which was already generated, or your own quest artifact, will be replaced by its base item type, but others will be intact.

[[Sting]], [[Orcrist]], and [[Excalibur]] have special generation conditions detailed on their pages.

== List of artifacts ==
:''See [[Source:artilist.h]] or the article for each artifact for more details.''
