===FIQHack===

[[FIQHack]] uses a different mechanism called [[piety]] to determine when you receive gifts or crowning from altar sacrifice.  In addition, only gifted artifacts affect the rate of future artifact gifts. Artifacts obtained via wishing are not included in the calculation.

== History ==

Until [[NetHack 3.6.0]], if the first sacrifice gift did not find any eligible artifacts, then no artifact gift would be given at all. This would most commonly happen with elven Priests or Rangers who named [[Sting]] and [[Orcrist]] in the hope of guaranteeing [[Stormbringer]] as their first gift, only to fail because Stormbringer had been generated in [[bones]] already. This would make it impossible to get any sacrifice gifts for the entire game unless they were to change their alignment.

Changing your alignment would give an alignment bonus if you were lawful or a penalty if you were chaotic, instead of resetting your alignment record to zero.

&&%s&& %s Unique item {145006 2022-03-21T01:38:10Z {4000227 Kufat}  A '''unique item''' is one of four specific objects required to complete the game:

* The [[Candelabrum of Invocation]]
* The [[Bell of Opening]]
* The [[Book of the Dead]]
* The [[Amulet of Yendor]]

The [[discoveries]] page lists these items under the "Unique Items" section. Unique items are defined by having the field <code>oc_unique</code> set to 1 in [[objects.c]]. While the unique items are also commonly referred to as '''invocation artifacts''', they do not count as [[artifact]]s for wishing purposes, as the player is guaranteed to encounter them. Unique items are indestructible (barring bugs) and may not be placed in [[container|containers]].

It is not possible to [[wish]] for any of the unique items. 

==Unique items versus artifacts==
Starting with [[NetHack 3.0.0]], all [[artifact]]s are also unique within a given game, but are not the same as unique items - they are specially named variants of their [[base item]] with additional benefits, and appear as named versions of those items when unidentified. For example, most games will have no more than one [[runesword]] or [[tsurugi]], as those items never generate randomly and only appear when [[Stormbringer]] or the [[Tsurugi of Muramasa]] (respectively) are generated. Neither counts as a unique item - it is possible to wish for them, or find them in a [[bones]] file if the aforementioned artifacts already exist.

==Variants==
===EvilHack===
[[EvilHack]] adds a couple of other "one-per-game" items that serve as the base item for artifacts, and are never randomly generated (except when their associated artifact is generated):

* triple-headed flail (basis for [[Butcher]])
* eight ball (basis for the [[Magic 8-Ball]])

The '''Discoveries''' page, accessed by pressing the backslash key ({{kbd|\}}), shows all the [[item]]s you have [[identification|identified]] so far, including those class-#[[name]]d. It can be useful for checking facts about items that are sometimes not immediately apparent, or are hidden by the game through description and identification.

Examples include details of [[randomized appearance]] (of [[potion]]s - useful to determine which [[potion]] is smoky - [[spellbook]]s, scrolls and base armor and weapon items), or what base item type an [[artifact]] is. This can be used to pseudo-identify further objects through the process of elimination.

You have a 100% chance of successfully writing scrolls and books listed in your discoveries list. Your god uses a different list for gifted spellbooks: preferably those not already in your spellcasting menu ({{kbd|Z}}).

=== Automatic knowledge ===
Some items are automatically identified by the game without any message once certain conditions are met. Items that you know of automatically, but have yet to encounter, are listed on the Discoveries page by a leading '''*''' before the description.
* Starting equipment: All characters start with full knowledge of all their starting equipment.
** If you start with an oil lamp, you know the potion of oil.
* Racial armor and weapons: All non-human characters start with full knowledge of their racial armor and weapons.
* Mundane weapons and armor: Some [[role]]s know them all.  [[Monk]]s know armor but not weapons.
* Water: [[Potion of unholy water]], [[potion of water]], [[potion of holy water]]— if you know one, you know the others. They are really the same type of potion.
* Healers start off knowing the [[potion of full healing]], even though they do not start with one.  In [[SLASH'EM]] they also start off knowing a variety of beneficial potions, such as potions of restore ability.

&&%s&& %s Curse-testing {145060 2022-03-26T17:31:16Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  In ''[[NetHack]]'', there are many cases and scenarios where you will want to test whether or not items are [[cursed]]. Below is a non-exhaustive list of '''curse-testing''' methods.

==Ways that work on all items==

These methods work for all classes of object.

===Priesthood===

[[Priest]]s can see the [[beatitude]] of all objects.

===Altar testing===

Items dropped on an [[altar]] will glow black if cursed and amber if blessed. You must not be [[blind]] to use this technique. If you are [[hallucinating]] when you do this, this method will only identify those items that are uncursed, as you will be unable to tell the difference between a black and an amber flash while hallucinating. Altar testing breaks [[atheist]] [[conduct]] unless [[blind]].

===Pet testing===

This can be used only to test whether an item is cursed or not.

A [[pet]] will "move only reluctantly" over any stack or pile of objects that contains one or more cursed objects, as long as the pet was not whistled onto it (using a [[magic whistle]] or [[eucalyptus leaf]]) and the stack contains no food. Pets will greedily seek out and eat up food of their preferred types without regard to cursed items underneath or above the food. You can expedite testing by dropping objects in choke-points like doorways or corridors to force your pet to walk onto the object's tile while following you.

<!-- Testing cursed pile of items takes a lot of time, while testing non-cursing pile of items is easy, so mass testing is not good, or at least it is not optimal to make pile of 5 items. -->
If you pet steps on an item without the message, and there is no food at the pile, and you did not call it with magic whistle, then all the items in the stack are non-cursed.

If you pet "move only reluctantly", at least one item on that square is cursed.

If you pet avoids to step on the square for a long time, at least one item on that square is probably cursed (the longer you wait, the higher chance for it).

===Identify===

Reading a [[scroll of identify]] (or casting the spell, or getting the gift from a [[throne]]) will reveal the [[BUC]] of any items identified. If you can cast identify at low failure rates and want to know the status of something now, this can actually be very useful.

===Holy or unholy water===

If you are willing to use up holy or unholy water, you can determine whether or not an object is cursed. If you think the object might be cursed and are OK with it becoming cursed if it isn't, [[dip]] it in [[unholy water]]. If nothing happens, the item was already cursed. If you think the object might be cursed and you want it uncursed, you can dip it in [[holy water]], and it will uncurse itself if cursed and bless itself if uncursed. If the item was already blessed, nothing will happen. This technique can be useful with items that don't stack and are expected to be either cursed or blessed.

===Fountain dipping===

You can dip items in a [[fountain]] and may find out whether or not they are cursed. There is a 4/30 chance that the item will become uncursed if cursed ("The water glows for a moment") or, if already non-cursed, nothing will happen ("A feeling of loss comes over you"). However, there is also a 1/30 chance that the item will be cursed outright with no message. Before choosing to employ this strategy, you should go read about the other potential effects of dipping in [[fountain]]s and be sure that you don't mind the other effects.

==Methods that work on weapons==

===Wield the item===

If the object you want to identify is a weapon, wield it and try to unwield it.  If you can, it wasn't cursed. This method has the problem that, if it was cursed, your hands are now welded to the object. This is fine if you have a [[scroll of remove curse]] you were looking to burn or can cast [[remove curse]] at low failure rates &mdash; as long as the object wasn't a two-handed weapon.

===Try to make a monster wield it===

Drop the weapon in front of a monster that will pick it up and wield it. If the weapon "welds itself to the monster's hands" or something similar, it's cursed. 

===Throw projectiles===

Cursed projectile weapons like darts, daggers, or shuriken may sometimes veer wildly off in another direction if you or a monster tries to throw them. They will not weld to your hands if you do this. You can #name a cursed projectile and other cursed projectiles of the same enchantment will stack with it, allowing you to detect further cursed items.

===Stacking===
If you [[wand of cancellation|zap cancellation]] at one of a stack of projectiles, and the rest still stack with it, they are uncursed (and unenchanted). Similarily, you might want to drop only one of your stack on an altar in case you find more.

'''Cone of cold''' is a medium-level attack spell. It is the [[Valkyrie]]'s [[special spell]].

==Effects==

===Unskilled or Basic===
At Unskilled or Basic [[skill]] level, the spell [[zap]]s a [[ray]] with the same effect as a [[wand of cold]]. NetHack will prompt you for a direction in which to cast the spell; you can also zap it at yourself, although this is not recommended.

===Skilled or Expert===

At Skilled or Expert level, you may choose a location at which to cast explosions of cold, with the following restrictions:
* this location must be no more than 10 squares away;
* it must be an open space;
* you must either see the chosen square normally (it must be lit and in the line of sight) ''or'' sense a monster on it via [[telepathy]], [[infravision]], a blessed [[potion of monster detection]], or its [[Spellbook of detect monsters|spell equivalent]] ([[warning]] will not suffice){{refsrc|spell.c|1232|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}.

The last two conditions do not need to be met if you are [[engulf]]ed.{{refsrc|spell.c|1241|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} In this case, the explosions will be centered around yourself, and nothing will be affected outside the engulfing entity.{{refsrc|explode.c|88|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

If there is a wall on the straight line between you and your target, the spell will explode around the square immediately before the first wall.{{refsrc|dothrow.c|442|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} Otherwise, the explosions will be centered around the location you chose. 2 to 9 explosions follow; the first is in the center, the subsequent ones randomly at any of the nine squares around that point. Each explosion affects the surrounding squares.{{refsrc|spell.c|1048|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

The damage to non-cold-resistant monsters is just [[XL]]/2 + 1 plus [[Spellcasting#Damage|spell damage bonus]],{{refsrc|spell.c|1060|nethack=3.6.1}} halved if they [[monster MR|resist]], doubled if they are resistant to fire, and doubled again is they're [[grab]]bing you and you're within blast radius.{{refsrc|explode.c|444|nethack=3.6.1}} Monsters are dealt additional damage equal to the number of potion stacks in their inventory, even if they're cold resistant and potions didn't freeze.{{refsrc|explode.c|411|nethack=3.6.1}}

Any explosions that would be centered on yourself do not take place, but instead do damage as 'zap self' above.

Explosions produce [[noise]].{{refsrc|explode.c|575|nethack=3.6.1}}

{{message|You are caught in the ball of cold!|You cast the spell at Skilled or Expert, at yourself.}}

==Strategy==

The best possible casting scenario for this spell is if you are a level 30 character, 18 [[intelligence]], and are casting at a fire-resistant monster. In this case, you can cast up to 9 cold explosions, each of which could hit the monster's square for (6&times;16&nbsp;+ 3&times;16) damage, for a total of 1296 damage. This makes this spell ''potentially'' the most devastating attack in NetHack, although under normal circumstances {{spell of|magic missile}} is likely to be better. The cone of cold is most useful for crowd control in [[Gehennom]], where many of the monsters are fire-resistant and thus more vulnerable to the spell. It is also very useful for dealing with [[vampire]]s transformed into other forms. As of 3.6.0, any [[vampire bat]], [[wolf]] or [[fog cloud]] in Gehennom is likely to come back to life as a [[vampire]] or [[vampire lord]]; using a cone of cold might kill the transformed form with an early blast and the risen [[vampire]] with one of the subsequent blasts. Coupled with {{spell of|detect monsters}}, this can be done from another room or corridor, keeping the player safe from the vampiric [[drain life (monster attack)|life-draining]] attack.

Enhancing to expert skill gives no benefits over skilled for this spell besides a decreased spell failure rate. A level 30 [[Valkyrie]] with a [[robe]] can cast this spell at 2% fail thanks to Valkyries' specialty spell bonus. The fail rate is 33% if the Valkyrie also wears [[gauntlets of power]].

The ASCII characters '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', and '''9''' are not used to represent anything in NetHack by default. However, you can use the keys '''{{kbd|0}}'''–'''{{kbd|9}}''' to specify a [[numeric prefix]] for a command or in a menu.

''',''' is used only on the [[Rogue level]] to represent an [[amulet]]. {{kbd|,}} is also the [[pick up]] command, and the [[Menu_controls|command to select all things]] on the current page in a menu in the [[tty]] and [[curses interface]]s.


Some players change the "monsters" option in the [[options]] file to take advantage of one of these unused symbols. A default line looks like:

 OPTIONS=monsters:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@ '&;:~]

One alternative is:

 OPTIONS=monsters:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@8'&;:~]

which uses "8" for [[ghost]]s and [[shade]]s. This makes them detectable via [[telepathy]] as well as generally easier to see.

== Historical uses ==

&&%s&& %s Next version {129716 2019-12-15T08:25:05Z {4000573 Elronnd} Update 'next version' The '''next version''' of NetHack is [[NetHack 3.7.0]]. There is no information about when it will be released, other than "When it's ready"; the [[DevTeam]] has a policy of not announcing release schedules. <ref>http://nethack.org/common/info.html#B2</ref> Anyone is free to [[NetHackWiki:Next_version_pool|hazard a guess]], though.

After the release of [[NetHack 3.4.3]] in 2003, the NetHack [[DevTeam]] went on a long hiatus. 3.4.3 was long [[NetHackWiki:Next_version_pool_3.4.3#Never|considered by some]] to be the final version of NetHack until December 7, 2015, twelve years after this version's release, when [[NetHack 3.6.0]] was released.

There are also various actively developed [[variant]]s by different developers that build on [[NetHack]] and could be considered a "next version" of NetHack in the same way as [[NetHack 1.3d]] was to [[Hack 1.0.3]].

==Leaked 3.5.0 source code==

In September 2014, a leaked source code distribution described as "NetHack 3.5.0 Beta" was circulated on the Internet, e.g. in the Usenet newsgroup [[rec.games.roguelike.nethack]].  In response, the DevTeam posted an official announcement on [http://nethack.org nethack.org] confirming the leak, but refuting any claims that it would represent an official release (beta or otherwise), and also retiring the version numbers 3.4.4 and 3.5, which had been incorrectly associated with the leaked code:

<blockquote src="http://nethack.org/">Recently a NetHack source distribution has appeared, claiming to be NetHack 3.5 or 3.5.0 or 3.4.4.

This claim is partially correct. This is our code. However it was not released by us or with our authorization. This code is not ready for release: it is unfinished, unpolished, and almost certainly very buggy. It has not been play-tested for balance or functionality. It is best considered a partial and unfinished rough draft. We will not be supporting this code, nor will we be releasing binaries or bugfixes for it. It will not be available through our website.

Due to this incident and to prevent confusion, we will not now nor in the future release anything with a version number of 3.4.4, 3.5, or 3.5.0.</blockquote>

Discussion about this leaked code can be found in the article [[leaked development version]].

==NetHack 4 confusion==

There is a variant of NetHack 3.4.3 known as [[NetHack 4]], which is not an official version 4 of NetHack from the DevTeam. More confusingly, [[User:Ais523|Ais523]], the maintainer of NetHack4, is now on the DevTeam but works on NetHack4 and vanilla separately. 

Unlike most other variants, NetHack4 has a drastically different codebase from vanilla, and the DevTeam internally refers to it as NetHack4, with no space. It is not actually version 4 of NetHack, and no such version currently exists.

The '''spiked pit''' is a [[trap]] which is similar to the regular [[pit]], but can deal more damage.

==Generation==
The treasury in [[Fort Ludios]] contains many spiked pits along with its land mines.

==Effects==
{{main|Pit#Effects|l1=Pit § Effects}}

Spiked pits have the same effects as normal pits, but additionally deal 1&ndash;10 damage. Each time you fall in, there is a {{frac|6}} chance that the spikes will be poisoned, which can be fatal for a character without [[poison resistance]].{{refsrc|src/trap.c|1246|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

[[Metallivore]]s can eat the spikes out of a spiked pit, turning it into a normal pit. {{refsrc|src/trap.c|2176|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

The spikes are never poisoned when a monster falls in.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|2445|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Pets that fall into a pit can be helped out by standing adjacent to the pit and untrapping in the direction of the pit. When you do this with a spiked pit, if you fail to remove your pet, they will suffer the effects of falling onto spikes each time you fail, making them angry (reducing their [[tameness]]) and counting as abuse for resurrection from the [[wand of undead turning]]. If they die at your hands, you suffer the consequences of killing them in a trap yourself (&minus;15 [[alignment record|alignment]] and an [[anger|angry]] god).

==Removal==
Push a [[boulder]] into it, to create a regular floor tile. Alternatively, get a metallivore to eat the spikes to create a normal pit.

==History==
Spiked pits were added in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

The '''sleeping gas trap''' is a [[trap]] that can put its victims to [[sleep]].

==Effects==

A sleeping gas trap puts you to sleep for up to 25 turns, unless you have sleep resistance or are polymorphed into a naturally [[breathless]] monster. An [[amulet of magical breathing]] does not protect you. {{refsrc|src/trap.c|1107|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

&&%s&& %s Graveyard {147887 2022-08-22T09:41:51Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} reorg, ver, ce A '''graveyard''' (also called a ''crypt'' or ''morgue'') is a [[special room]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' that contains various [[undead]], [[demon]]s, and corpses as well as [[chests]], [[box]]es and [[grave]]s.

A '''graveyard level''' is a level where undead creatures are less likely to leave corpses - there is a {{frac|9}} chance of an undead monster leaving a corpse if you kill it, and a {{frac|3}} chance otherwise.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|38|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}<ref>http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/mon2-343.html</ref>

==List of graveyard levels==
All levels with a graveyard ''room'' are considered graveyard levels; a [[headstone]] alone does not mark a level as a graveyard, nor does the presence of [[bones]].

===Special levels with graveyards===
* The [[Valley of the Dead]]
* [[Orcus-town]]
* [[Moloch's Sanctum]]
* The home, locate and goal levels of the [[Tourist quest]]
* All levels of the [[Priest quest]]

===Designated graveyard levels===
The following levels are designated as graveyard levels in the code, despite not necessarily having actual graveyards:

* The [[Castle]]
* The top and bottom levels of the [[Wizard of Yendor's Tower]]
* Levels on which you have summoned [[undead]] with the cursed [[Book of the Dead]] or [[Bell of Opening]]

==Generation==
In a regular rooms-and-corridors level of [[dungeon level]] 12 or below, a graveyard has a {{frac|6}} chance of being generated assuming there are no other special rooms (i.e., [[shop]]s, [[throne room]]s, [[leprechaun hall]]s, [[zoo]]s, [[temple]]s or [[beehive]]s).

Graveyards are capable of generating [[major demon]]s outside of [[Gehennom]] - the chance of a demon generating as a graveyard monster is ([[dungeon level]] - 11)/(10* [[dungeon level]]).{{refsrc|src/mkroom.c|439|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
[[Wraith]]s are a common occurrence in graveyards, and their corpses are highly desirable; some players lure wraiths away from graveyard levels before killing them. Note that the [[Castle]] is considered a graveyard level, making luring wraiths up from the Valley of the Dead more difficult.

==Messages==
{{message|You suddenly realize it is unnaturally quiet.<br>The <hair> on the back of your <neck> stands up.|There is a graveyard on the level.}}

}}

The '''quantum mechanic''', {{monsym|quantum mechanic}}, is a [[monster]] in [[Nethack]], and the only member of the {{white|Q}} '''quantum mechanic''' [[monster class]]. It has an attack that causes its target to [[teleport]] when it hits;  the teleport is subject to [[magic cancellation]], permits [[you]] to use [[teleport control]], and will fail on [[non-teleport level]]s.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|[[Genetic engineer]]s will also be {{white|Q}}.}}

Quantum mechanics are [[humanoid]] but are not considered [[human (monster attribute)|human]], so they will respect [[Elbereth]], and human player characters will not be penalized for [[cannibalism]] by [[eat]]ing a quantum mechanic [[corpse]]. They are [[poisonous]] to eat, however, and doing so will toggle intrinsic [[speed]] - granting it if you do not have it, and removing it if you already possess it.

==Generation==
===Schroedinger's Cat===
There is a 5% chance that a quantum mechanic carries a [[large box]]{{refsrc|makemon.c|737|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}. Upon opening the box, with a 50% chance a [[peaceful]] [[housecat]] [[call|named]] "[[Schroedinger's Cat]]" is generated; if generation or 50% chance fails, the box will contain a cat corpse named "Schroedinger's Cat". The state of the cat is not determined until the box is opened; in fact, the [[large box]] is effectively empty until opened. The housecat has no special properties, and is simply based on a well-known thought experiment in quantum physics. See the article for more specific information.

==Strategy==
Quantum mechanics do not hit particularly hard themselves, but the teleportation will cause you no end of annoyance outside areas like [[Sokoban]]. It can also place you in a much more disadvantageous position than you were previously, e.g. by teleporting you away from the stairs in large open areas, separating you from your [[pet]]s, or else placing you next to a particularly nasty monster. If teleported out of a [[shop]], the [[shopkeeper]] will be angered if you have any unpaid items on hand; be sure to establish credit beforehand if possible. As a pet, the quantum mechanic has some relative use since it can teleport away many other monsters, but can also teleport shopkeepers out of their shops if their level is high enough, which angers them. 

Eating a quantum mechanic corpse is a useful way to gain the speed intrinsic, but should be avoided while you have it; you can [[tinning kit|tin]] them to reapply the intrinsic speed if it is lost, e.g. from the attacks of a [[cockatrice]], [[green slime]], or [[shade]]. While the same can be done with a [[wand of speed monster]], this allows you to save more of its charges for pets, especially after [[Orcus-town]]; use a [[stethoscope]] to keep track of your own speed.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Quantum mechanics}}
{{wikipedia|Schrödinger's cat}}
The monster's name is a [[pun]] on "quantum mechanics", a branch of physics. The messages that accompany the monster's teleporting attack and the toggling of intrinsic speed are jokes based on the Heisenberg [[wikipedia:uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]], which states that measuring the position of a particle makes its velocity more uncertain, and vice versa. Toggling the speed intrinsic could also be a reference to the transitions that occur between discrete [[wikipedia:energy level|energy levels]] in quantum mechanics.

"Schrödinger's cat" is a famous thought experiment in quantum mechanics involving imagining locking a cat in a box with a mechanism that has a 50% chance of killing the cat, depending upon the final state of a quantum system. The orthodox [[wikipedia:Copenhagen interpretation|Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics asserts that the cat in the box is in a superposition of possible outcomes; in half of them the cat is dead, and in the other half it is alive. Only when the box is opened and "observed" is the quantum wavefunction collapsed and the fate of the cat determined; Schrödinger asserted that this was absurd, and thus so was the Copenhagen interpretation. Modern physicists are still divided on its validity.

{{encyclopedia|
These creatures are not native to this universe; they seem to have strangely derived powers, and unknown motives.


 _Uncertainty Principle_ The principle that it is not possible to know with unlimited accuracy both the position and momentum of a particle. ... An explanation of the uncertainty is that in order to locate a particle exactly, an observer must be able to bounce off it a photon of radiation; this act of location itself alters the position of the particle in an unpredictable way. To locate the position accurately, photons of short wavelength would have to be used. The high momentum of such photons would cause a large effect on the position. On the other hand, using photons of lower momenta would have less effect on the particle's position, but would be less accurate because of the lower wavelength.

Artifacts tire after you invoke them, and you cannot do so again for <code>[[rnz]](100)</code> turns (averages 100; can be up to 2000, but 95% of the time it is less than 400). If you invoke again too soon, "You feel that the <artifact> is ignoring you" and 3d10 turns are added to the wait time.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1433|nethack=3.6.1}}  For artifacts that give temporary [[extrinsic]]s, the wait time is counted from the moment they're switched off (via an #invoke or otherwise).{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1620|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Optimal invocation schedule==
{{anchor|Optimum invocation schedule}}Invoking strategy is basically a trade-off between the risk of getting nothing and waiting too long. The turns to wait after a successful #invoke versus probability of success are graphed below (assuming your experience is <=17): <div class="thumb tcenter">[[Image:GraphWaitingTimeVersusInvokeSuccessProbability.svg|thumb|waiting time after successful #invoke versus probability of success of invocation]]</div>

If you need the artifact reliably, such as emergency healing from the [[Staff of Aesculapius|Staff of Aesculapius]], you should treat it like prayer - #invoke only in dire need. If you want a simple strategy for the most successful #invocations per turn, e. g. charging lots of wands with the [[PYEC]], you should wait 78 turns between invocations. This yields an expected wait
of 180.83 turns. If you miss the time a bit, the rate of success does not go down much. Your experience level does not matter. 

The optimum strategy is waiting
 82;81;68;81;88;67;54;96;78;62;88;81;65;63;81;65 
turns after consecutive failed #invokes and restarting the list after successes. This yields an expected wait of 180.2354 turns.

'''Usenet''' is one of the oldest parts of the Internet.

It consists of discussion groups called "newsgroups". Servers propagate messages in a peer-to-peer fashion. Clients connect to servers to read and post to newsgroups.

Access to Usenet is normally tolled. If you pay a fee, you may purchase real NNTP access to a Usenet server, and connect your own client software (and trade large files at binary groups). Many Usenet participants are stuck using free methods like http://groups.google.com to read and post.

The tree listed here is restricted to those groups, past or present, that have some substantial connection to NetHack.  The full Usenet hierarchy is of course much vaster than this.

Such things were in fashion around 2000. You can find multiple versions of the NetHack Code at http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/nhcode/. The NetHack Code is, in essence, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100903143858/http://www.geekcode.com/geek.html Geek Code] equivalent for NetHack players.

==Example==

Here is an example included in the document by Boudewijn Wayers describing version 1.2.2 of the code.

<pre>
NH 3.3.0L A Reakk-Bar-Hum-Mal-Neu HP:161(257) Pw:65 AC:-40 L:20 T:54959
          [+++ )++ i- !2 P S++ D++ p $ !t s W+ E--- PS-- PP++
          G+ C- I++ Ps+ @W(8)tw N-- !Y X++ So++ Sp++++ !sb wb-- +0
</pre>

Let's consider each section of the code.

Preliminaries:

* '''NH''': this shows that it's a NetHack code and not a Geek code
* '''3.3.0L''': this game was played on a [[Linux]] machine running NetHack version [[3.3.0]]
* '''A''': this game is the player's latest or best ascension

Status line:
* '''Reakk-Bar-Hum-Mal-Neu''': the character was a [[human]] [[male]] [[neutral]] [[barbarian]] named Reakk
* '''HP:161(257)''': Reakk had a maximum [[HP]] of 257, and a current HP of 161.
* '''Pw:65''': Reakk had 65 [[power]]
* '''AC:-40''': Reakk had an [[AC]] of -40
* '''L:20''': Reakk was at [[XL]] 20
* '''T:54959''': the game took 54959 turns

Equipment:
* '''[+++''': Reakk had excellent armor. To quote the NetHack code: ''"I go for the best and nothing less, if I have to wish for every single thing. I enchant it till it vibrates. Not satisfied with anything worse than AC-40. I enjoy the lengthy discussions on the newsgroup about the relative merits of +5 oilskin over GDSM versus SDSM and a cloak of magic resistance."''
* ''')++''': Reakk had reasonably good weapons. To quote the NetHack code: ''"I have an artifact weapon appropiate for my alignment, enchanted to +6 or so, and wield that by preference unless something comes up that asks for other measures. All my weapons are properly blessed and rustproofed."''
* '''i-''': Reakk poorly managed his inventory. To quote the NetHack code: ''"Don't you hate it when you continually have to drop those rocks you're picking up all the time?"''

Playing style:
* '''!2''': Reakk refused to [[twoweapon]].
* '''P''': Reakk [[pray]]ed whenever he was in need.
* '''S++''': Reakk deliberately created many monsters for [[sacrifice]] in the hopes of receiving a [[sacrifice gift]].
* '''D++''': Reakk donated almost all money in the dungeon to [[aligned priest]]s.
* '''p''': Reakk had a [[pet]] at one point, and did not deliberately drive it away or keep it around.
* '''$''': Reakk would not hoard [[gold]] or throw it away. To quote the NetHack code: ''"I'm a spender, not a saver. If I find an 'ad aerarium' message I'm inclined to go and pick up the loot, but like the cookie says, "money lost, little lost".  Let's not forget priests..."''
* '''!t''': Reakk did not collect "treasure" (ie. [[gem]]s)
* '''s''': Reakk visited [[shop]]s when he needed to, and sold some spare items, but was not interested in more advanced shop-related strategies.

Indulgences and restrictions:
* '''W+''': Reakk was fine with [[wishing]] for any non-artifact.
* '''E---''': Reakk was strongly opposed to using [[Elbereth]]. To quote the NetHack code: ''"The E-word is for wimps.  Grayswandir works much better."''
* '''PS--''': Reakk avoided [[polymorph control]].
* '''PP++''': Reakk engaged in [[polypiling]] multiple times in his game, and deliberately gathered [[polyfodder]].
* '''G+''': Reakk carefully decided which species to [[genocide]], but mainly just for survival, rather than as a hobby.
* '''C-''': Reakk carried a [[ring of conflict]], but hardly used it
* '''I++''': Reakk had fairly good knowledge of [[intrinsic]]s and used that knowledge in his game.
* '''Ps+''': Reakk can ascend in roughly 100000 moves.
* '''@W(8)tw''': Reakk killed the [[Wizard of Yendor]] 8 times, [[tin]]ned his corpse and zapped a [[wand of death]] at him.
* '''N--''': Reakk avoided taking off his clothes, and so avoided [[nurse dancing]] more or less by accident.
* '''!Y''': Reakk deliberately does not wish for quest artifacts, and so avoided using the [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]

Experience and knowledge:
* '''X++''': Reakk has ascended most [[role]]s, and has started trying [[conduct]]s.
* '''So++''': Reakk engages in [[source diving]].
* '''Sp++++''': Reakk does not merely read [[spoiler]]s but writes them and shares them.

Cheats:
* '''!sb''': Reakk is opposed to [[save scumming]].
* '''wb--''': Reakk deletes any [[bones]] files from [[wizard mode]] games
* '''+0''': Reakk died zero times.
