!Notes
!Origin
|-

|scroll of time
|300
|
* Grants you a large number of movement points. Cursed scrolls paralyze you for a few turns.

* confused: You only identify the scroll of knowledge itself.
* '''This scroll cannot be written.''' "You cannot write something you do not know!"

=== Gems/Stones ===

'''healthstone:'''
* Ported from SLASH'EM.

'''whetstone:'''
* Refined the functionality of whetstones and made much more user friendly. We can now apply a stack of whetstones to a stack of weapons (Before this was limited to applying one whetstone to a single object). We can use (a)pply or #rub with whetstones.
* Removed the extra penalty for artifacts (how can artifacts resist sharpening?)
* Whetstones can now remove corrosion (in addition to rust)
* A blessed whetstone can uncurse a weapon
* Blessed whetstones have a chance to enchant non-corroded, uncursed +0 weapons up to +1.
* Cursed whetstones can erode or negatively enchant weapons.
* You can use whetstones in shallow water, pools, moats, rust traps, sinks, and toilets.
* If you don't have a water source available, you can use potions of water. There is a 1d7 chance of using it up on each application.
* Previously, whetstones took too long to use (very discouraging for players), the required time has been lowered considerably. If sharpening a stack of weapons, the turns will scale with the size of the stack. Cavemen are skilled with rocks so they can sharpen much faster than other roles.
* In SLASH'EM, using a whetstone on one of these would also activate the quaffing effects of those features. In Hack'EM these effects have been removed.

'''sling bullet:'''
* Similar to flint stones, but deal 1d6 vs small and 1d8 vs large monsters.
* Like flint stones, their weight has been reduced to 1.

'''Other stone changes'''
* Added more upgrade paths for gray stones. 
* luckstones and whetstones can be upgraded into healthstones and vice versa. 
* flintstones upgrade into luck/whetstones.

== Artifacts: ==

'''Design decision #1:'''

    In SlashEM, artifacts grant a flat damage bonus (instead of their equivalent d-notation damage). This has been implemented to more fully capture the flavor of SLASH'EM.

'''Design decision #2:'''

    Any roles that had 2 guaranteed altar sacrifice gifts in SLASH'EM have been reduced to just 1. Having 2 just seems excessive, and most of the time, the second gift was just a barrier to overcome to get to better stuff (example: Deathsword for Barbarian, or Deluder for Wizards)
   
=== Artifact Mechanics ===

'''Wishing for artifacts:'''
* Instead of being based off of how many artifacts exist in the game total (vanilla NetHack method), success is based off of how many artifacts the player has wished for (successful or not). 
* ALSO - the odds are high that it comes with its owner...

* Players can two-weapon with an artifact in each hand, if those artifacts happen to get along with each other.
* If wielding/wearing any of the 'banes, taming becomes impossible.
* Various artifacts that have a nemesis monster warn against those monsters.
* Almost all of the stock weapon artifacts have had their to-hit and damage modifiers adjusted in the players favor.
* Certain artifacts can either deliver extra damage to their nemesis monsters, or have a small percentage chance of delivering a fatal blow – this applies to the player as well!
