When you anger a god, they will sometimes strike you with a lightning bolt from the heavens (see [[Anger#Smiting]]). This attack would normally kill an adventurer outright. However, if you have [[shock resistance]], [[reflection]], [[life saving]], or are engulfed by a monster, you will survive the bolt. If this occurs, the god will follow up with a wide-angle disintegration beam.{{refsrc|pray.c|494}}

If you are still engulfed, the disintegration beam will hit the engulfing monster instead. This occurs when the monster is shock resistant. In vanilla NetHack, the only engulfing monsters with shock resistance are [[energy vortex|energy vortices]], which are also disintegration-resistant, so the disintegration beam will have no effect.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Monsters can gain intrinsics from corpses, so it would in theory be possible for an engulfer to be shock- but not disintegration-resistant}}

Otherwise, the beam will strike you. First, your shield, cloak, and body armor will be disintegrated, unless they provide reflection or disintegration resistance. Then, if you are wearing a shirt and no body armor or cloak, it will be disintegrated (a shirt worn under [[silver dragon scale mail]], for example, would not be disintegrated).

If you do not possess [[disintegration resistance]] the beam will then kill you outright, though you will survive if you have life saving. Note that reflection will ''not'' save you, though it might save some of your armor as described above.

I find it hard to imagine what such an article should contain. In every case that I can think of, information about a weapon skill belongs on the corresponding article for the weapon itself, i.e. there is no need for a [[Dagger_skill]] article, because everything in such a page should instead be added to the [[Dagger]] article.

There are a small number of cases where different weapons share the same skills, but these can be handled by page redirects, page merging (as in [[Frost Brand]]), or even by writing suitable content (as in [[pick-axe]]). [[User:Djao|Djao]] 14:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

:I had thought it would be useful to have a simple page listing all the weapons in a skill category, and all the proficiencies the roles can attain in that skill. I'm not particularly attached to the idea, though, so it might be worth doing without them and seeing how that works out. (Feel free to modify <code>skill_full_name</code> yourself, if you want.) -- [[User:Killian|Killian]] 23:14, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

:: I don't actually know how to modify template code, so I was hoping that you would do it :) [[User:Djao|Djao]] 07:16, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

:::This is just C++ code, which generates regular MediaWiki markup. I still have to paste the program's output into the template pages myself (as I haven't bothered to automate that part of the process yet). Either way, I've done the conversion, and added in a few redirects for when the skill name doesn't exactly match the weapon name. -- [[User:Killian|Killian]] 08:07, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
== Bare hands ==
Is there a particular reason [[Bare hands]] doesn't have the appropriate skill table? I've manually added it's corresponding Template:Bare_hands_skill_table, but it was a manual process. Any tips on getting non-programmers the ability to output the results? -- [[User:Kalon|Kalon]] 02:11, 27 March 2008 (UTC)
:Also [[SLASH'EM]] [[Undead Slayer]] can reach Grand Master on Bare Hands

== 3.6.2 ==

It'd be nice if someone could update this to reflect the current version. I was trying to clear up a table on [[escape spells]] since Barbarians can now reach Basic in their special spell school along with the other classes that previously had it restricted, only to find a second "pretty table" that pretty much says the same as the skill table above it. My initial intent was to remove the pretty table and edit the template's table, only to find out that's an exercise in programming too tedious and risky for someone of my limited experience. So if I could get a bone thrown to me here... --[[User:Umbire the Phantom|Umbire the Phantom]] ([[User talk:Umbire the Phantom|talk]]) 15:32, 23 October 2019 (UTC)}

&&%s&& %s Ice {142321 2021-09-03T22:42:11Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{features}}
'''Ice''', {{cyan|.}}, is a [[dungeon feature]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

Ice may be formed formed when a [[pool]] is frozen by a [[spellbook of cone of cold|spell]] or [[wand of cold]], a [[frost horn]], or a [[white dragon|cold breath]] [[winter wolf|attack]], and is naturally found in a few places such as the [[Valkyrie quest]]. 

==Description==
Ice is slippery, and walking on it often causes you to stumble, similar to one of the effects of [[fumbling]]. When [[riding]] a non-flying steed over ice, there is a chance you may fall off your [[saddle]]. [[Corpse]]s rot half as fast if laying on ice, and items on an icy floor will slide further when [[kick]]ed.

Slipping on ice can be prevented by wearing [[snow boots]], being a [[Valkyrie]], or polymorphing into a monster with [[cold resistance]]. Cold resistance from any other source (e.g. eating a corpse, wearing the appropriate ring, or being a level 13 [[Monk]]) will ''not'' prevent this fumbling. If snow boots are the random appearance of [[fumble boots]], they still negate the fumbling effect of ice, but cause you to fumble by their own effect.

===Melting===
Flames from a [[fire]]-breathing monster, a [[wand of fire]], [[fire traps]], and other sources of fire can melt ice and cause you to fall into the newly created [[moat]]. Having [[reflection]] will guard against the rays, but will not prevent ice underfoot from melting. As with falling into normal water, your inventory will get [[wet]], and you will attempt to climb out, with a chance of drowning dependent on the circumstances.

Ice created by a spell or breath attack has a chance of melting on its own after between 50&ndash;2000 turns.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|4363|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Ice created on level generation will always be permanent, and newly created ice has a chance of becoming permanent as well. Thawing ice that is hit with another spell or breath attack will increase the duration, and has another chance of becoming permanent. Players with [[warning]] will be informed if they are standing on ice that will break in under 15 turns.{{refsrc|src/hack.c|2231|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Ice tiles appear in two [[themed room]]s: an "ice room" where the entire floor is ice, and another room with a random terrain at the exact center, which can potentially be ice.}}

==Strategy==
Creating ice is a common means of traversing water in areas such as [[Medusa's Island]] and the [[Castle]]. A source of [[levitation]] or [[water walking boots]] can help prevent drowning.

Melting ice is especially dangerous on the fire trap-laden Valkyrie quest, where an unwary [[Valkyrie]] can trigger one and drown; in addition to the above, players can also stick to the narrow snow paths, such as the one leading to [[The Norn]]'s dwelling. Additionally, if the Norn begins wandering around the ice (e.g., after you #[[chat]] to her but before you qualify for entry to the quest), there is a minuscule possibility that she may step on one of the fire traps in the area and drown as a result. While very unlikely to occur in the vast majority of games, this can be avoided by simply waiting until you are at experience level 14 before chatting to her.

==History==
Icy terrain first appears in [[NetHack 3.1.0]] with the introduction of the [[Quest]] branch and the [[Valkyrie quest]]. Ice melting over time was implemented in [[3.6.0]].

==Messages==
{{message|Whee! A(n) <item> slides across the ice.|You kicked an object resting on an icy floor.}}
{{message|Some ice melts away.|You saw an ice tile melt completely and revert to water.}}
{{message|The ice seems very soft and slushy.|You have warning and are standing on ice that will melt in under 15 turns.}}
{{message|You feel the ice shift beneath you!|As above, but in under 10 turns.}}
{{message|The ice, is gonna BREAK!|As above, but in under 5 turns; this is a direct quote from ''[[wikipedia:The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'', hence its punctuation.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the [[Ice Mage]] [[Ice Mage quest|quest branch]] fittingly has icy plains on the home and upper filler levels.

===Lethe patch===
In the [[Lethe patch]] for vanilla ''NetHack'' and SLASH'EM, the lair of [[Geryon]] found within [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)|Gehennom]] is almost completely made of ice.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], one of the [[Big Room]] maps and the goal level of the [[Knight quest]] contains several ice tiles, as does one of the [[Lethe Gorge (dNetHack)|Lethe Gorge]] maps. Icy terrain also appears in the lairs of [[Baalphegor]], [[Kostchtchie]], and the [[creature in the ice]] (which can be either [[Leviathan]] or [[Levistus]]).

A '''skeleton''' is a magically animated undead creature that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

Skeletons have a [[slowing attack]] that can remove intrinsic speed.  [[Chat]]ting with a skeleton, even a [[tame]] one, will [[paralyze]] you for a few turns.{{refsrc|src/sounds.c|720|nethack=3.6.6}} They have immunities to [[cold resistance|cold]], [[sleep resistance|sleep]], [[poison resistance|poison]], and [[stoning]].

==Generation==
Skeletons normally only appear when you first enter [[Orcus-town]], where five will be generated.{{refsrc|dat/gehennom.des|405|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} They are valid targets for [[polymorph trap]]s, and [[polypiling]] multiple objects made of [[bone]], such as [[unicorn horn]]s, may also create a skeleton.

A generated skeleton [[Monster starting inventory|may appear with]] a [[leather armor]] (25%), a [[knife]] (8%) and/or a [[short sword]] (16%), but will not get a random [[offensive item]].

==Strategy==
While skeletons are not a great threat compared to the [[shade]]s also found in Orcus Town, their ability to nullify speed still makes them dangerous. Their stoning resistance means that they can wield [[footrice]] [[corpses]], so be careful not to leave any near one.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
A skeleton is a magically animated undead creature.  Unlike
shades, only a humanoid creature can be used to create a
skeleton.  No one knows why this is true, but it has become
an accepted fact amongst the practitioners of the black arts.

&&%s&& %s Technique {145758 2022-04-30T07:37:38Z {4000978 Aximili} mention defunct in splicehack Techniques are special abilities in SLASH'EM which can be used by the extended command #technique. After usage, you usually have to wait some time before the technique is ready for use again.

Most techniques are available to either certain roles or certain races. ([[Disarm (technique)|Disarm]] is the one exception.)

Each turn you are under 10% HP, you may enter limit mode, which appears as LIMIT. Using a technique under limit mode doesn't expend it. You could use it next turn again if previously prepared. Also, techniques that have not yet recovered from a previous usage can be activated under limit mode if and only if the [[Options#menustyle|menustyle option]] is set to "traditional" – this is probably a bug.

Limit mode usually activates about 53% of the time, based on "a simple pseudorandom number generator"{{refsrc|tech.c|196|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}, but if your HP is exactly 1 (and your maximum HP is at least 11), limit mode is definitely on.

== Technique skill level ==
Some of the techniques' effects are dependent on the players skill in this technique. For example a [[Doppelganger]] using their [[liquid leap]] technique is able to leap a further distance the more skilled they are in that technique.

When a player first acquires a technique, that technique's skill level is set to 1.{{refsrc|tech.h|32|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}{{refsrc|tech.c|86|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} For every [[experience level]] the player gains, the skill level of techniques they already know will increase.{{refsrc|tech.c|190|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

== SpliceHack ==
Early versions of [[SpliceHack]] had techniques. They were removed in version 1.0.0, making techniques a [[defunct features (SpliceHack)|defunct feature in SpliceHack]].
