'''Voanairruth''' is the [[white dragon]] ridden by [[Slipscale the Betrayer]] in [[SpliceHack]]. Other than its [[covetous]] attacks, it is utterly unremarkable. Despite being a unique creature, it can be tamed.

'''Slipscale the Betrayer''' is the [[dragonmaster]] [[quest nemesis]]. He is generated riding [[Voanairruth]]. Together, the two can deal a lot of damage and efficiently steal quest artifacts,  but overall he is a relatively easy nemesis.

'''Alucard''' guards the gates of [[Vlad the Impaler]]'s castle in [[SpliceHack]]. He is always generated with a katana and in vampiric form. Unlike most vampires, his alternate form is that of a [[barghest]].

== Strategy ==
Alucard is very fast, and hits very hard. He is not [[covetous]], however, and with a little luck does not have to be fought at all.

The '''Barghest''' is a monster introduced in [[SpliceHack]]. It possesses a unique gaze attack. Whenever the player meets the gaze of the barghest, there is a 1/13 chance that they receive the message, "The barghest catches your eyes, and you feel deeply uneasy," and lose one point of luck.

The '''spectre''', {{black|&nbsp;}}, is an advanced form of [[ghost (monster class)|ghost]] that appears in [[SpliceHack]] and [[EvilHack]].

==Generation==
Spectres are often randomly generated in the lower levels of the dungeon, particularly in [[Gehennom]]. In addition, when a bones file is created in which the player is at least [[XL]] 15 (or XL 21 in EvilHack) and would leave behind a ghost, they instead leave behind a spectre.

==Strategy==
Spectres that appear in bones are especially dangerous, since they are likely to equip themselves with the weapons and armor that they died with.

==Encyclopedia Entry==

'''Dal Zethire''' is the [[cartomancer]] [[quest nemesis]]. Although his attacks are relatively weak, his multitude of usable items makes him very annoying to fight.

== Possessions ==
Dal Zethire is generated with the following items:
* 1-3 [[cursed]] [[scroll of create monster|scrolls of create monster]]
* [[scroll of fire]]
* [[scroll of earth]]
* [[scroll of teleportation]]
* [[expensive camera]]

== Strategy ==
If he picks up [[the Holographic Void Lily]], Dal Zethire will have reflection, making zapping him with a [[wand of death]] a waste of valuable charges. It is possible for Dal Zethire to be generated with a cursed scroll of teleport, making destroying his scrolls a top priority. Hitting Dal Zethire with fire attacks can potentially burn his scrolls, which will prevent him from filling the room with monsters, blinding the player, or dropping boulders on them.

&&%s&& %s Android {143453 2021-10-27T13:35:14Z {4000763 EasterlyIrk} clarify what turns it off The '''Android''' in [[dNetHack]] is an [[Anachrononaut]] with a race of [[Clockwork Automaton (starting race)|Clockwork Automaton]] and it plays out like its own role in many ways.

==Starting Package==

The Android Anachrononaut begins play with either a leather jacket or a black dress, leather gloves, high boots, and an android visor.  Offensively they have a white or black vibrosword and a large axe.

===Supplemental Weapons===
In addition to the starting equipment, a large number of additional weapons are scattered across the Dungeons of Doom.  All supplemental weapons are fully identified and never have negative enchantment.
*Vibroweapons
**A white vibrospear
**A white vibrozanbato
**A black (gold-bladed) vibrospear
**A black (gold-bladed) vibrozanbato
**A red-eyed vibrosword
*Force weapons
**A force pike
**A double force-blade
**A force blade/force whip
*Unusual weapons
**A gigantic two-handed sword
**A large silver short sword
**A large silver two-handed sword
**A large silver spear
**A large metallic shocking two-handed sword
**A metallic shocking spear
**A metallic shocking long sword
**A metallic saber
**An metallic axiomatic katana
**A flaying rapier
**A flaying glaive

In addition, a loyal android or gynoid pet will be located somewhere in the dungeon, equipped with the complementary set of starting equipment.

==Intrinsics==
Androids gain intrinsics at these experience levels:
*XL 1: [[Stoning resistance]], [[Poison resistance]], [[Sickness resistance]], [[Cold resistance]]
*XL 5: [[Stealth]]
*XL 7: [[Speed]]
*XL 10: [[Shock resistance]]
*XL 15: [[Warning]], [[Fire resistance]]

== Racial benefits and restrictions ==

*Androids do not breathe
*Androids do not eat and also do not need winding like other Clockwork characters.  Instead they must sleep to recover.
*Androids do not recover [[HP]] or [[energy|Pw]] normally.
**Androids can recover HP at the cost of Pw by waiting with <code>.</code> like other Clockwork characters. Searching with <code>s</code> will not do this.
*Androids innately know the charges in wands and tools that have charges.
*Androids have very high Constitution and will therefore have much higher average hit points than other Anachronauts.
*Androids have naturally high armor class and damage reduction.
*Androids cannot use "lightsaber forms" although they may still reach expert in saber.
*Androids get Accelerated skill slots -- 1.5x the amount of skill slots compared to other races (same as human)
*Androids are "weldproof" and so can use cursed weapons and try on gear without fear.
*Androids can throw anything and have it return to their hand, similar to Mjollnir. The Annulus can be used to devastating effect over great distances, especially if highly enchanted and converted to a double-bladed lightsaber.

== Android Active Abilities ==

One of the most important aspects of the Android is the #monster extended command.

*Sleep and regenerate:  This is on a random timeout of around 1,000 turns and regains HP and energy.  
**Be careful using it as you will be immobilized, as is normal with sleep effects.
**If you are interrupted it still counts as using the ability so you will need to wait for the next reset of the timeout.
**If you don't sleep you will eventually become fatigued. After 3000 turns, you will get the message "You feel fatigued" (if you are above 10 pw). This will begin to drain power slowly. If you go below 10 pw while fatigued, you get the message "You feel extremely fatigued". 
**Once you hit no power, you get the message "You feel like you are about to pass out." At the start of any turn where you have 0 energy, your system may force a "sleep mode" to recover, so be careful of that.  The per-turn odds of this occurring are 1/your level.
*Emergency speed:  This increases movement speed greatly - you now run at 3x speed.  It costs 1 energy per turn of movement, which is several moves.  Any non-move action turns it off, including jumping. Shift-moving and autotravel are allowed. This takes a turn to enable, so you will not immediately be able to run away just after turning it on.
*Recharger:  This costs 10 energy and acts as an uncursed scroll of charging.
*Combo:  This is used to deliver an attack and its effects vary depending on the wielded weapons.  It is not usable if you are wielding 2 weapons at once, but a shield is allowed with a one-handed weapon.  Each level of skill in your wielded weapon unlocks one step in the combo, and the ability costs 1 energy per step used (therefore, it's good to cancel out of the combo if the target dies).
**Unarmed combo: 1) attack twice, 2) kick once, 3) jump, then kick once, 4) jump, then attack twice and kick twice. 5) "Finishing blow": 16d8 damage to one adjacent foe.
**Spear/Lance combo: 1) attack twice, 2) attack twice, 3) attack twice.
**Whip combo: 1) attack twice, 2) apply whip, then attack once 3) If using a force whip: lock the whip, then attack twice. If using another whip: apply whip, then attack once.
**Any Lit Lightsaber: 1) attack twice '''or''' throw saber once 2) attack twice '''or''' throw saber once, then kick 3) jump, then attack twice '''or''' throw saber once. 
**Any other one-handed weapon: 1) Attack twice 2) Throw a weapon 3) Throw a weapon then attack once.
**Any other two-handed weapon: 1) Attack the primary target twice and all neighboring squares once. 2) Kick the primary target, then attack the primary target twice and all neighboring squares once. 3) Throw a weapon then attack the primary target.

&&%s&& %s DNetHack from Nethack {136819 2021-01-05T03:55:18Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Noteworthy Key Differences */ (Exactly which corpses will revive more with a Dread Seraph?) Link {{DISPLAYTITLE:dNetHack guide for players of Nethack}}

dNethack has a similar initial feel to regular Nethack but if you play the exact same way you might end up getting frustrated or losing a very promising character.

This guide's purpose is to help people seamlessly switch between Nethack and dNethack and therefore enjoy the game more!

==Noteworthy Key Differences==
*The Pokedex used in dNethack for monsters is extremely helpful and will generally show special attacks and resistances for every monster you can view.
*When looking at your item list ("i") you can click the letter for any item and then click "I" to describe the item.  If the item is fully identified, this will give excellent information on most items and is extremely useful for understanding new items.
*The item inspection view takes into account the "item form" or "item activation" (such as light sabers) but does not take into account enchantment level (+/-) for weapons. 
*Eating corpses for "resistances" will last only 5,000 turns.  To get permanent "resistance" you must wear an item that confers it or be "crowned" or have a role-specific intrinsic.
*Seduction effects are much more dangerous. Wearing an "engagement ring" (the unidentified appearance, no matter what that is in your game) will always prevent the seduction attempt from succeeding. This also works on nymph and phantasm thievery.
*Many monsters take reduced damage from one or more type of weapon (piercing/slashing/bludgeoning).  The game will always give you a message the first time you hit the monster indicating that the monster is taking reduced damage ("<weapon> is ineffective against <monster"). This will quarter the damage dealt, rounding down (so 0 damage is a possibility with weak weapons).
*Corpses left on the ground have a low chance of reanimating as a "zombie" version of the dead monster.  These monsters take reduced damage from bludgeoning and do more melee damage but are slow and do not have ranged attacks.  Even the corpses of zombies may rise again multiple times potentially. If a [[dread seraph]] is on the level, they have a much higher chance of reanimating. 
*Monster power levels in the mid and late game are significantly higher than regular Nethack.  Monsters have more special abilities and resistances and generally more hit points than mid and late game equivalents in regular Nethack.  Remember to view the Pokedex record to gain insight.
*Shopkeepers offer various services for a fee. They'll always offer at least one form of identification, and possibly uncursing, charging, armor works, or weapon works.
** Shopkeepers will always offer basic ID, premium ID, or both. Basic only does the base item type (not even BUC), and premium is a full identify identical to the scroll. Shopkeepers will always be able to identify items of a type that they will buy/sell (for example, an unidentified helm at an armor shopkeeper). If you ask them to identify something they don't sell, it will only succeed 1/4 of the time (1/2 if premium). The price is based on the item's base type, with premium identify being twice as expensive, and artifacts being 1.5x more expensive. If you are confused or hallucinating, this will always fail. 
**Uncursing simply uncurses that item. It can uncurse anything regardless of type. If you are confused, it will curse the item instead. If you are hallucinating, it will instead bless the item 1/4 of the time, with nothing else happening otherwise. If you haven't BUC'd the object, nothing will happen.
**Charging is mostly basic charging, but wand shopkeepers can rarely offer premium charging. They will only charge things they would sell (a tool shop will charge any tool, wand shop will charge wands, etc.). Tool shops, wand shops, ring shops, Izchak, and spellbook shops can offer charging. 
**Armor-works can enchant or rustproof. Rustproofing will always repair the item fully in addition to proofing, but costs more depending on how damaged the item is. Enchanting will enchant the item, costing more depending on how high the new enchantment is. No item can be enchanted past +3, even if it can normally be enchanted to +7. Attempting to do so will just cost a lot and fail. Only armor shopkeepers will offer armor-works.
**Weapon-works can enchant, rustproof, or poison. Rustproofing and enchanting works the same way as armor, except you can enchant to +5. Poisoning can always poison, but can sometimes drug (somewhat often), stain (blindness) or envenom (paralysis), and very rarely filth-crust (sickness) weapons. Law quest acid shops or Mithardir sandwalker shops can acid-coat. Only weapon shopkeepers can offer weapon-works.
*Converting altars will often result in the other god summoning in one or more monsters to protect the altar.  These monsters may be very difficult for characters of lower level so use caution when converting an altar unless you have a good escape item. The monsters will be based on the god's alignment and which god (neutral gods tend to favor elementals, Offler favors crocodiles, drow gods favor drow minions, etc.), so some gods are worse than others. Be careful with unaligned altars to the Dread Fracture or the Black Mother. 
*Armor Class no longer conveys "damage reduction" and instead there is a separate visible field for "damage reduction" in the status bar labeled "DR".  The "DR" value is actually per body location and a breakdown of each location can be seen by hitting "[" to see your equipped armor.
*Luckstones make luck time out more slowly rather than never timing out (600 turns instead of 300 without a luckstone).
*Switching weapons using "x" does not count as a turn so using ranged weapons and melee weapons together is extremely effective for all roles.
*Sokoban levels only spawn monsters in the area outside the "boulder pushing" part of the level.  Therefore level one of Sokoban does not spawn monsters.

==Features in dNethack not in Nethack==
*You will see blue tildes (~) squares from time to time.  These are "shallow water".  You may walk in it, but if your boots are metal they may rust.  The shallow water is useful for being able to #dip potions to turn them into water. You cannot drink it, and sea monsters can swim in it.
*Drinking booze increases the character's future likelihood of being able to control movements while confused.  The formula is ((Booze consumed / 3) - 1) / (Booze consumed / 3).  The character can benefit from at most 3 total booze per character level.
*Items may (very rarely) be of different materials.  This will affect traits associated with the item. The main place you will find this is monster starting inventories (Rilmani, some uniques, etc.).
*effigy is an item that at any BUC status will function the same way as a blessed scroll of remove curse.  The one exception is when using it to remove the effect of a "weeping angel" in which case it will summon another weeping angel after removing the original effect.
*Pets follow their owner far better than in regular Nethack so pet strategies are easier to utilize.

*Significant changes to [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Devil_Lords|Devil Lords]] and [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Demon_Lords|Demon Lords]]
*When reaching the levels with a Devil Lord or Demon Lord it is not always necessary to fight them.  Not all of them block the stairs.  Avoiding them may be the best course of progress in those cases.
*Re-organizes and expands the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches|dungeon]]. ([[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches/Map|ASCII-Sketch of the dungeon]])

== From Google Groups ==

These might be considered authoritative, except that Google Groups munges email addresses to discourage spammers from harvesting them. It hardly matters if the Usenet headers are altered, but some sources contain email addresses (which have probably long since disappeared) and some [[wikipedia:uuencode|uuencoded]] files could possibly be corrupted.

== Techniques ==
Cartomancers can make use of the following techniques:
* Level 1: '''Soul of the cards''': This technique polymorphs the first scroll in the player's inventory and immediately reads it. If the player is in trouble, then the scroll will be a type that can help them, otherwise the type of scroll is random.
* Level 5: '''Card combo''': This technique lets the player immediately read several scrolls in the same turn.
* Level 15: '''Card capture''': This technique transforms a targeted monster into a scroll of create monster, keyed to that monster.

== Special rules ==
=== Cartomancer names for items ===
Since Cartomancers are a reference to ''Yu-Gi-Oh'' and other trading card games, several of their items have been renamed accordingly.

{| class="prettytable"
! Item name !! Cartomancer item name
|-
| [[large box]] || ''deck box''
|-
| [[lock pick]] || ''worthless card''
|-
| [[shuriken]] || ''razor card''
|-
| [[Hawaiian shirt]] || ''graphic tee''
|-
| [[expensive camera]] || ''holographic card''
|-
| [[credit card]] || ''banned card''
|-
| [[gold piece]] || ''victory token''
|-
| [[sack]] || ''card bag''
|}

=== Scroll rarity ===
When playing a Cartomancer, all scrolls are referred to with a rarity. This rarity does not refer to how often the item is generated, but instead to the base price of the item. This system functions as a limited form of [[price identification]].
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Cost''' !! '''Rarity'''
|-
| 0–59 || common
|-
| 60–99 || uncommon
|-
| 100–199 || rare
|-
| 200–299 || super rare
|-
| &ge; 300 || legendary
|-
|}

=== Create specific monster ===
When playing a Cartomancer, every time a creature has a chance to leave a corpse, there is a {{frac|2}} chance that a scroll of create monster is dropped instead of a corpse. Such scrolls are keyed to the type of the monster that was killed. Reading the scroll will create a tame version of that monster, which will serve the Cartomancer for between 15 and (4&nbsp;&times; XL) turns. When these turns have elapsed, the creature vanishes in a puff of smoke.

Other roles can obtain these special scrolls via [[bones]], although the creature will only remain for 5 to 10 turns, and reading a cursed scroll will always create a hostile version of the monster instead of a tame one.

=== Writing scrolls ===
Writing scrolls as a Cartomancer is considered forgery, and as such carries a hefty penalty to [[alignment record]].

== Strategy ==
=== Conducts ===
Due to encountering corpses less often and starting with no food, Cartomancers might as well attempt the [[foodless]] or related [[conduct]]s. [[Illiterate]], on the other hand, would take away everything that the role normally provides.

=== Early game ===
Cartomancers are arguably the hardest role in SpliceHack, in large part due to the difficulty of living past the early game. Like Tourists, they start with little to no combat ability and no spellbooks. Unlike Tourists, however, Cartomancers lack a reliable source of food. Many of the monsters that can be tamed are not very useful, and as such survival is a struggle. Players should prioritize finding a reliable food source, a decent weapon, and some spellbooks.

=== Late game ===
Cartomancers excel in the late game. There is ample access to scrolls of create monster, and the player can take advantage of the Cartomancer's powerful spellcasting skills.

== Quest ==
The Cartomancer quest sees the player fighting [[Dal Zethire]] in an attempt to obtain [[the Holographic Void Lily]].

They had a chance of paralyzing monsters that they attacked when unarmed, but were only able to consume corpses that are rotting. As undead, ghouls were affected by [[turn undead]]. All [[zombie|zombies]] and [[ghoul|ghouls]] were generated peaceful to them.

While [[SpliceHack]] aims to keep most monsters, items, and rules identical with their counterparts in Vanilla NetHack, some changes have been made for purposes of balance, quality of life, and fun. This page does not list expansions to the game, such as new levels, monsters, or items. It only lists features which are different than their original incarnations.

== Quality-of-life changes ==
This section lists changes that were made for the purposes of quality of life, and where the changes originated.

=== xNetHack ===
* Looking at monsters now tells you what weapon they are wielding, and whether they are armored. Farlooking at a monster provides you with a list of their resistances, attacks, and other statistics. The intention behind this page is to make looking at the wiki during play largely unnecessary. 
* Paranoid trap and swimming confirmation.
* Carrying capacity and inventory slots are displayed for the player.
* Martial arts users never have clumsy kicks.
* All wands with unambiguous engraving messages auto-identify when engraved with.
* Blessed stethoscopes can identify eggs.

=== L ===
* Colored walls and floors, using modified version of L's colored walls and floors patch.

=== NAO ===
* The <code>hilite_hidden_stairs</code> option highlights stairs with objects on top of them. This is enabled by default.

=== DynaHack ===
* Skill progress is visible to the player in the form of a percentage.

=== Original ===
* '''The [[mysterious force]] has been removed.'''
* '''The [[quest]] can be started at level 10.'''
