In [[UnNetHack]], elves do not regenerate health while touching iron with bare skin. Weapons may be wielded without consequence if gloves are worn. Similarly, amulets do not inhibit regeneration if worn over a shirt or body armor.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], iron objects deal an additional d([[XL]]) of extra damage against iron-hating monster. This includes wielded non-weapons made of iron, as well as worn iron rings when fighting [[unarmed]] without [[gloves]].<ref>[https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dNAO/blob/compat-3.21.3/src/xhityhelpers.c#L1417 dNetHack xhityhelpers.c, line 1417]</ref>

Iron-hating monsters have the <code>MG_HATESIRON</code> in monst.c, and are listed below:

&&%s&& %s Punishment {148475 2022-10-05T00:39:02Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} de-SLEX You can be '''punished''' by your god for a variety of reasons, including [[pray]]ing while your [[deity]] is angry or by reading a non-blessed [[scroll of punishment]]. A heavy iron ball is attached to you by an [[iron chain]]: {{cyan|0}}{{cyan|_}}{{white|@}}. If you are polymorphed into an [[amorphous]], [[whirly]] or [[unsolid]] creature when you get punished, the ball and chain will appear but fall off immediately.{{refsrc|read.c|2355|nethack=3.6.1}}

If punished while already being chained to an iron ball, the ball's weight is increased by 160 (320 if the method of punishment was a cursed scroll of punishment).{{refsrc|read.c|2350|nethack=3.6.1}}

Dragging an iron ball one square takes at least 2 turns regardless of enhanced speed. This also inhibits efficient travel, including running in a direction and the [[travel]] command. If you do not wish to carry the ball, you are forced to move one square at a time using either the letter or number pad keys.

You cannot swap places with a pet while punished.{{refsrc|uhitm.c|339|nethack=3.6.1}}

==The heavy iron ball==
{{item
|name=heavy iron ball
|appearance=heavy iron ball
|tile=[[image:heavy iron ball.png]]
|cost=10
|weight=480+
|color=cyan
|symbol=0
}}

Whilst punished, the chain cannot be picked up, but the iron ball can. It is an unusual object which appears in its own section in the [[inventory]].

The ball will follow you everywhere for as long as it is attached.

===Falling with an attached iron ball===
Falling into a [[pit]], [[spiked pit]], or [[trap door]] with an attached ball will cause it to fall in on top of you, dealing 25&ndash;31 damage (uniform distribution, average 28), or 3 damage if you are wearing a metallic helm. (Death message "crunched in the head by an iron ball".)<ref>{{function|ball.c|ballfall}} (damage) and {{function|do.c|goto_level}} (trap doors) and {{function|trap.c|dotrap}} (pits)</ref>

Regardless of your [[encumbrance]], and unless you are flying, you will stumble going down stairs with an iron ball. If you are wielding the ball or carrying the ball and wielding nothing, you have a 5/6 chance of falling forward, causing you to take another 1d6 damage and possibly drop other items, especially heavier ones (but never worn items or cursed [[loadstones]]). If the ball is loose or you're wielding something else, you have a 50% chance of the ball smacking into you for 1d20 damage and abusing your strength, followed by a 1/2 (1/6 if the ball smacked you) chance of the ball dragging you downstairs for 1d6 damage, causing you to drop random other items, and abusing your strength (potentially for a second time).

In any case, falling down the stairs because of the ball at all will cause you to always drop the ball if you had it in your inventory and take 1d3 damage. (Death messages from this are "dragged downstairs by an iron ball" for either 1d6 roll, "killed by an iron ball collision" for the 1d20 roll, and "killed by tumbling down a flight of stairs/falling off a ladder" for the 1d3 roll.) <ref>{{function|ball.c|drag_down}} (damage and item dropping) and {{function|do.c|goto_level}} (call to drag_down, an extra d3 damage)</ref>

===Strategy===
The iron ball makes a surprisingly good weapon, doing 1-25 base damage, which is biased towards higher numbers if the ball has been made heavier.{{refsrc|src/weapon.c|304|nethack=3.6.6|comment=it adds 1d(extra weight/40) to base 1d25 damage, which is then capped at 25}}  The downside is the extreme weight&mdash;only 20 units short of a [[loadstone]] and the same weight as 48 [[dagger]]s. Thus, the ball ''can'' be used as a weapon, but you should ditch it as soon as you have something more effective.

The iron ball also gives you a limited ability to jump while it is chained to you. Throwing it will pull you along in that direction for up to 4 squares, but beware using this method to cross water&mdash;the ball will travel 5 squares, and if that lands in water, you will be pulled down into the water with it. Throwing in this manner will also let you escape traps.

Also, throwing an iron ball may exercise your strength.{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1674|nethack=3.6.1}}

==Ending punishment==
{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|"Wrenching free" of a buried iron ball no longer ends punishment.}}

Removing the iron ball or breaking open the chain ends your punishment. There are a number of ways to do this:

* Zap a [[wand of opening]] or casting a spell of {{spell of|knock}} down at the chain
* Read a [[scroll of remove curse]], of any [[BUC]] status, while not confused
* [[Pray]]; punishment counts as a minor problem
* Have it stolen by a [[nymph]] while taken into inventory
* Have it eaten by a [[metallivore]], such as a [[rock mole]] or [[rust monster]]
* Polymorph into a nymph and remove it using the [[monster (command)|#monster]] command
* Polymorph into a metallivore and eat the ball away
* Polymorph into an amorphous, whirly or non-solid monster and thus slip out of the chain
* Ring the blessed [[Bell of Opening]]
* Crush the ball or chain in a [[drawbridge]]
* Shatter the chain by triggering a [[land mine]] explosion
* Drop the ball in a [[pit]] and fill the pit with a boulder. In 3.4.3 and derived variants, this will immediately end punishment. As of 3.6.0, this will instead tether you to a 3&times;3 square around where the ball was buried. Attempting to move outside this area will use up a turn, but after 20&ndash;70 turns of struggling, you will "finally wrench the ball free" and will no longer be punished.{{refsrc|dig.c|1825|nethack=3.6.1}} It is also possible to bury the ball and walk into a [[bear trap]], which will immediately end punishment.

Dropping, dragging, or throwing the iron ball into [[lava]] does ''not'' end punishment; the ball will not be visible while in the lava, but moving away will drag it back out.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
Punishment can be acquired by drawing the 10 of Trumps (Punishment) when having your fortune read by a [[gypsy]].

Punishment can be removed by using the [[Doppelganger (starting race)|doppelganger]]'s [[liquid leap]] [[technique]].

===Convict Patch===
The [[Convict|Convict Patch]] and variants that incorporate it&mdash;[[UnNetHack]], [[DynaHack]], [[dNetHack]], and [[SlashTHEM]]&mdash;make some changes to punishment that can radically alter its significance to gameplay, depending on the variant.

Punishment is one of the distinctive characteristics of life as a Convict: Convicts enter the dungeon chained to a heavy iron ball. As in vanilla, this is a significant mobility handicap that prevents them from displacing their pets, running, or using the [[travel]] command, and condemns them to moving at effectively half the usual rate. However, as a sort of compensation, the patch encourages use of the iron ball as a weapon, by treating it as a proper weapon that uses the [[flail]] skill. Only Convicts can actually advance the skill with a wielded iron ball, but any role that is unrestricted in flails is able to benefit from the to-hit and damage bonuses that come with Basic or better skill. The Convict [[quest artifact]], [[the Iron Ball of Liberation]], is an artifact heavy iron ball that can be reattached to the user as a side-effect of its [[invoke]] ability, and which players may or may not choose to wield after acquiring.

As a result, the Convict patch makes the heavy iron ball, already a high-damage improvised weapon, an even more viable non-artifact weapon choice that compares well with the [[dwarvish mattock]] and [[crysknife]]. One implication of this is that there is more incentive to train the otherwise little-used flail skill. Another is that punishment is more advantageous&mdash;beyond merely giving the player the ability to "jump" by throwing the iron ball&mdash;to the extent that players with access to the flail skill and sufficient carrying capacity might actually seek out [[scroll of punishment|scrolls of punishment]] in order to get an iron ball or increase the weight and damage dealt by an existing one. Depending on your circumstances, being punished in variants that include this patch might actually be seen as a reward.

===UnNetHack===
UnNetHack includes the Convict role and its implications for punishment. In addition, the [[Punisher]], a monster that is only naturally generated in the [[Sheol]] branch, is named for its ability to cast a [[monster spell]] that punishes the player.

To '''call''' (or '''name''') a [[monster]], press {{kbd|shift|c}}. These are a few reasons to name a monster:

* Roleplay (renaming your pet)
* Reminders (naming a monster you know is permanently blind, etc.)
* Allows you to differentiate same-race monsters in a group (to find out which one is carrying the [[wand of fire]], etc.)
* Allows you to abuse the [[Astral call bug]] (though this is fixed in most variants and on [[nethack.alt.org]])
* When trying to tame a magic-resistant monster like a [[master mind flayer]], you might get large quantities of pets - name these so you don't accidentally sacrifice one.
* Leave a funny death message (killed by a soldier ant called Go Team Ants)
* Let the [[MSGTYPE]] [[option]] filter away pet battle messages.

== Max charges ==

I don't really see the use of this field. Supposedly it's to let the user know how many uses to expect out of the wand, but most wands will have fewer uses than that, so a newbie user expecting to e.g. always get eight zaps out of their wand of teleportation is going to be disappointed (and probably dead). A minimum charges field would be more valuable, since it lets the user know ''at least'' how many zaps they're guaranteed, but I think a better idea would just be listing "charges", and specifying the range of values. --[[User:Darth l33t|Darth l33t]] ([[User talk:Darth l33t|talk]]) 17:43, 21 June 2021 (UTC)

:Making it just charges would work, yeah, but I'd think it was of use for people looking to charge their wands frequently (usually via [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]). --[[User:Umbire the Phantom|Umbire the Phantom]] ([[User talk:Umbire the Phantom|talk]]) 11:34, 25 June 2021 (UTC)

::Perhaps, but that's a relatively small proportion of players (Tourists and PYEC wishers) who are fairly advanced at the game, and so already know the max charges of each type of wand. A much larger group (and more likely to need the wiki) are new players to want to know how often they can expect their unidentified wands to work, and they'd be better served by either the minimum charges or the range of charges. --[[User:Darth l33t|Darth l33t]] ([[User talk:Darth l33t|talk]]) 13:48, 25 June 2021 (UTC)}

Wands are listed above by increasing price, then alphabetically.  The
COST field denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the weight
(100 zorkmids weighs 1).

Wands comprise 4% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
6% in containers, 5% on the Rogue level, and 8% in hell.  PROB is
the relative probability of each subtype.  They appear 1/34 cursed,
16/17 uncursed, and 1/34 blessed.

The CHG field specifies the maximum number of charges that a wand
normally has.  An exclamation (!) denotes that a wand of wishing may only
be recharged once.  Wands of wishing start with 1 to 3 charges; otherwise,
the wand starts with a number of charges at most 4 less than its maximum.

Each time you (z)ap or (E)ngrave with a wand, you use one charge.  A wand
with zero charges left has a 1 in 121 chance of wresting a last charge
and then turning to dust each time it is zapped (this won't happen if the
wand was cancelled but not recharged).  Cancelling a wand will make it
uncursed and (except for wands of cancellation) it will get zero charges.

Wands may be recharged by scrolls of charging or by the Platinum Yendorian
Express Card.  Previously-recharged wands have a chance of exploding (up
to a maximum of 100% for a 7:x wand or a wand of wishing); see scrl-343.txt.
A cursed scroll will have no effect on a blessed wand or a wand with no
charges; otherwise, "Your <wand> vibrates briefly" and it gets zero charges.
An uncursed scroll will bring the number of charges to a random number from
1 to a random number between 5 and the maximum charges shown above (or for
a wand of wishing a random number from 1 to 3); a blessed scroll will bring
the number of charges in the wand to a random number from 5 to the maximum
charges shown above, or for a wand of wishing to three charges.  If it
already has that number of charges, it gains one more charge.  A wand of
wishing charged beyond three charges will explode.
"Your <wand> <glows/vibrates> briefly." if the new enchantment is below the
maximum; "Your <wand> <glows blue/vibrates> for a moment." otherwise.

The TYPE of wand denotes the behavior when it is zapped.  NODIR wands do
not ask for a direction.  BEAM wands ask for a direction, but do not show
a visibly animated effect when zapped.  RAY wands produce a ray which is
animated on the screen; if you are unblind when you zap the wand, you
will also identify that type of wand.

The appearances of wands are randomized from the following descriptions:
    glass       balsa       crystal     maple       pine
    oak         ebony       marble      tin         brass
    copper      silver      platinum    iridium     zinc
    aluminum    uranium     iron        steel       hexagonal
    short       runed       long        curved      forked
    spiked      jeweled


Zapping wands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nondirectional wands will be identified if you saw their effect (e.g., you
found a secret door with a wand of secret door detection).  If the wand
produces a visible ray or beam, you will identify the wand if you were
unblind.  The range of a RAY will be 7 to 13 squares; this range may be
lessened by the ray causing effects or bouncing.  Zapping a RAY wand
upwards or downwards is equivalent to restricting the ray to a range of 1.
BEAM wands have a range of 6 to 13 (other than digging), which can
similarly be lessened, and will not bounce; they will be identified if you
observe an effect caused by them.

Cursed wands have a 1% chance of exploding when zapped; this does 1 to
6 points of damage for each charge in the wand, plus an additional 2
to 12 points of damage, and abuses your strength.

Monsters are not angered by wands of digging, locking, nothing, opening,
probing, or undead turning (if not undead and none of their inventory was
affected); being zapped with (or missed by) other wands will cause peaceful
monsters to become hostile if you were the zapper.

wand, you can get one of the messages below if you are unblinded, not
levitating, and over a writable floor.  Some messages are the same for
different types of wands, some messages require an engraving already on
that square, and some wands will not provide any means of identification
this way.  Nondirectional wands will act as if they were zapped.  If you
didn't wrest the last charge from the wand, you can write a message in
the dust (or engrave if specified below).  These messages provide (perhaps
in combination with judicious zapping) a safe method of identifying many
wands.

The '''shield of reflection''' is a rare, but useful item in ''[[NetHack]]''. When unidentified, it appears as a '''polished silver shield'''; when [[blind]], it is referred to as a '''smooth shield'''.

==Generation==
The statue of [[Perseus]] on [[Medusa's Island]] has a chance of containing a [[cursed]] +0 shield of reflection; the second '[[titan]]' variation gives it a 25% chance, while all other variants give it a 75% chance.{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|57|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|156|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|274|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|374|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

[[Angel]]s and [[Aleax]]es have a 25% chance of [[Monster starting inventory|being generated]] with a shield of reflection, while all [[archon]]s are generated with one.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|340|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Effects==
When worn, the shield provides 2 [[AC]] and conveys [[reflection]], true to its name. As it is made of [[silver]], it gains a damage bonus against against silver-hating monsters when wielded as a weapon.

==Strategy==
{{main|Shield#Strategy}}
Although reflection is a crucial property, shields inhibit both [[twoweapon]]ing and [[spellcasting]], making the shield of reflection a somewhat unpopular choice for the [[ascension kit]]. Even so, it is still a solid find for early- to mid-game characters who don't plan to rely exclusively on spells; come the late game, it can serve as a primary or secondary means of reflection for late-game characters who cannot twoweapon, such as [[Cavemen]] or [[Ranger]]s, or else do not want to, and who will not urgently need spellcasting outside of situations where the shield can be removed at will.

==Variants==
In [[UnNetHack]] 5.1.0, [[dNetHack]], and [[SlashTHEM]], [[Itlachiayaque]] is an [[artifact]] shield of reflection that replaces the [[Orb of Detection]] as the [[Archeologist]] [[quest artifact]].

He is named for the Greek mythological figure that beheaded and killed [[Medusa]], using his [[shield of reflection|polished shield]] to view her reflection and avoid meeting her gaze directly.
