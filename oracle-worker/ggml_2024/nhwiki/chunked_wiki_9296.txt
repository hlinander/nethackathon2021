|[[The Eye of Vecna]]
|[[eyeball]]
|Non-aligned
|
* The Eye of Vecna is an extremely powerful artifact that is an actual body part that comes from [[Vecna]] himself. In this setting, Vecna must be destroyed in order to obtain the Eye, and even then, there is only a 50% chance that it will drop (the other 50% is the Hand of Vecna dropping). Be aware that if Vecna is destroyed via stoning, his Eye will not appear. When carried, the Eye of Vecna confers cold resistance, ESP, [[astral vision]], and half spell damage. When invoked, it causes the Eye to death gaze at all monsters within visual range, either greatly reducing their hit points or killing them outright if they don't have magic resistance. Using the Eye this way can be detrimental, as each use drops the players luck and alignment by three points, and abuses wisdom. Invoking the Eye too often can cause it to turn on the player instead, killing them. The Eye of Vecna can be eaten, but doing so is strongly discouraged. It can also be sacrificed on an altar for maximum value. Cannot be wished for. 
|EvilHack
|-

|[[The Hand of Vecna]]
|[[mummified hand]]
|Non-aligned
|
* The Hand of Vecna is also an extremely powerful artifact that is an actual body part that comes from [[Vecna]] himself. Just as with the Eye, Vecna must be destroyed in order to obtain the Hand, and even then, there is only a 50% chance that it will drop (the other 50% is the Eye of Vecna dropping). Be aware that if Vecna is destroyed via stoning, his Hand will not appear. The Hand of Vecna appears as a 'mummified hand', and takes up the glove slot for worn armor. Once 'worn' (it fuses itself to your left arm), it cannot be removed, ever, even if the player polymorphs into a monster that would normally cause it to drop their gloves. Because of this, it is immune to erosion, disintegration, destroy armor monster spell, and destroy armor scroll. It also cannot be stolen when worn. The Hand can be enchanted up to +7, but because it can't be destroyed, it will never evaporate if attempting to enchant it higher than +7 (nothing happens). It's powers include: hungerless regeneration, half physical damage, and disease resistance. It can be invoked for its death magic just like the Eye, killing or hurting any monster within line of sight that isn't resistant to death magic. And just as with the Eye, invoking its death magic has consequences. The Hand of Vecna also confers giant strength like gauntlets of power, and will cause an additional 1d5 + 7 (8-12) hit points of cold damage via melee attack to monsters affected by cold, regardless of whether a weapon is wielded or are fighting bare-handed. Worn rings can be removed without issue, even if the Hand of Vecna is cursed, as it's not treated as worn armor. Objects like a cockatrice corpse can also be handled without concern. The Hand must be 'worn' for any of these abilities to function. Cannot be wished for.

** The enchantment of a launcher applies to missiles shot from it.
** However, the enchantment on a launcher and missiles does not stack.
** This means you only need to enchant the launcher and can save scrolls of enchant weapon for other uses.
** Example #1: You have a +7 bow and +0 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.
** Example #2: You have a +0 bow and +7 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.
** Example #3: You have a +7 bow and +7 arrows. The arrows will act as if +7.
** Example #4: You have a +3 bow and +2 arrows. The arrows will act as if +3.

== Dragons and Dragon Scales == 

	EvilHack uses the dtsund patch for dragon scales, which means that dragon scale	mail no longer exists - but we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Since robes are now body armor - we can even create dragon scaled robes! Evil introduced some passive effects, I have expanded these so that every dragon scale provides them. I have also switched around or added new abilities. Most of these abilities are from other forks, but some are my own addition. Dragon scales worn on their own only exhibit their primary effect.
