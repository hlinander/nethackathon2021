The upstair is at the marked point. Smaug is at the point marked D with the Arkenstone and an emerald; he is also surrounded by his horde of gems, composed of (clockwise, starting northwest of Smaug) a dilithium crystal, a stack of a diamond and an amber stone, a jade stone, a sapphire, an aquamarine, and a turquoise stone. The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls.

===Entry===
First time:
 You find yourself on the familiar bank of the Long Lake, with the
 buildings of Esgaroth visible nearby. The Laketown archers keep away
 those monsters that manage to cross the water, but unfortunately the lands
 outside are not so safe. Wolves howl on the wind! 
 You steel yourself, and resolve to hurriedly cross the water and find out 
 why you were summoned, and why Thorin is here, instead of in the Dwarven 
 mines of Ered Luin?

Next time:
 Once again you stand on the shores of the Long Lake.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Yet again you stand on the shores of the Long Lake. Occasionally, you
 notice red flashes to the north.

===Quest guardians===
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Avenge our forefathers for us, <playername>!"
 "The King under the Mountain shall return and the rivers run with gold!"
 "If you can do this, <playername>...perhaps? The Mansions of Khazad-Dum await.."
 "They say the wealth of the dragon is beyond counting."
 "The Blue are rich in iron, but my heart yearns for gold.."

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 You instantly recognise Thorin from when you last saw him in the mines 
 of Ered Luin. His descendancy from Durin the Deathless, and more recently 
 Thror, King under the Mountain, is obvious. He bears himself with pride 
 and hauteur, and his long, flowing beard is shock-white.
 He stands, and visible at his side beneath the sky-blue hooded cloak is a 
 sword, seemingly Elven in design, that looks to have a mighty lineage.
 Pushing back his hood, he gives you a slow stare before speaking.
 "The Wild can be a dangerous place to travel alone in these dark days, yet 
 I see you have come far. But first I must ascertain how far..."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Ah, <playername>, you have returned.. Tell me of your more recent adventures.
 What have you learnt? Have you grown more experienced in fighting?"

This message is not currently used:

 "So, <playername>, again you stand before me. In the Wild the wargs and goblins
 grow ever more restless, and Smaug stirs in the north. I know not how
 much longer we can last. Are you yet ready?"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "<playername>! You have failed? A thousand curses on you and yours! If you have
 woken the Dragon but not killed him, we are surely doomed to perish in
 dragon fire!
 I would have you killed now, but you deserve not even that. Begone! And
 if fortune looks kindly on you, know that no Dwarf will."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Ah, <playername>, it is foolish in the extreme to underestimate a dragon, and 
 I cannot be sure you would succede. Go ye back into the Wild and hew ye 
 some more orcs, and return when you are a Tunneler."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "Ah, alas, <playername>. The creatures of Morgoth have corrupted you in your
 fight.
 Dragons are cunning and intelligent, and any not pure of spirit will
 surely be enslaved by their spells. I will heed the lesson of the Narn I
 Hin Hurin, and send you not thither now.
 Go back out, and return when you are better prepared."

When finally assigned the quest:

 Yes, for better or ill, I deem you are ready. As you know, some 170 
 years ago the accursed dragon Smaug descended on my grandfather's Kingdom 
 in Erebor, killing many of my kin and driving us from our halls. I was 
 there, although fortunately outside at the time..
 This defeat weighs heavily on us, <playername>. I tell you there is no 
 small store of gold in that mountain, and also the Arkenstone, Heart of 
 the Mountain. A more wondrous gem has not been seen since the first Age, 
 and never in this part of the world.
 I long to take up arms myself and attempt to defeat the dragon, yet I am 
 nearing my 200th year, and I fear my skills are not as they were. I ask 
 you, <playername>, to take up this quest for me. Succede in this, and your 
 reward shall be what of the treasure you can carry out yourself!
 Go, <playername>, and return victorious!

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "Be wary of his eyes! Dragons are mighty in enchantment!"
 "There is a secret door on the east side!"
 "My forefathers were mighty in metalsmithing..you may find equipment to aid you."
 "Beware the dragon's flame! You will need a defence against heat."
 "A dragon's scales make excellent armour. You will need a mighty weapon!"
 "Some dragons have soft undersides. But Smaug has an armour of gold and gems!"
 "Dragons have excellent hearing and smell, and do not need to see you."
 "Kill Smaug, and you avenge your murdered forefathers!"
 "Erebor and Dale were famed throughout the north. It can be so again!"
 "Beware not only the jaws and flame, but also the tail and claws."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:

 You have followed the River Running to its source at the Front
 Gate. Here is the entrance to the Lonely Mountain. To the east
 you can just make out the ruins of Dale.
 Steam drifts out the gateway, and in some places the water bubbles...The 
 Dragon is obviously in.
 The wind howls through the tree--wind? The Wargs are come! And orcs with 
 them! The goblins from the mountains must have got wind of something..

When returning:

 Once again you stand at the entrance to the Lonely Mountain.

When first entering the goal level:

 As you near the Great Hall of Thrain, the dragon-stench increases to
 almost unbearable levels. Only the reknowned stamina and willpower of the
 dwarves allows you to continue. Occasionally, you hear a near-by rumble or
 hissing sound as Smaug exhales.

When returning:

 The mountain rumbles with the dragon's fury. Smaug was not pleased with 
 your escape, and won't want to let you go this time..

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "Well, <playername>, good of you to come..I haven't tasted Dwarf in a while. 
 Chomped a few when I moved in, though."

Upon further meetings:

 "Watch those whiskers, stumpy, I might singe them off.."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "Intelligence is a survival trait. It'll be a favour to weed you out.."

When you have the Arkenstone, but Smaug is still alive:

 "I'll have the Arkenstone back before long. You're not leaving with it, I
 guarantee that."

====Discouragement====

Smaug will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "So they gave up on burglars? A pity, I liked the taste of hobbit."
 "Go back to your mines, long-beard, before I roast you!"
 "You fight well for a dwarf, but no mortal ever defeated a dragon!"
 "Your best could not kill me when I came, and I am grown now far stronger!"
 "That is a fine weapon you have - it shall look well in my collection!"
 "Your prancing amuses me. I may even let you live.."
 "You have courage, Dwarf. Fortunately, you will still taste good."
 "You act as if you had a chance.. But 'tis true, only a fool would have come."
 "A curse on the armour of Dwarves.. I fear I shall need a tin-opener."
 "You show some small skill.. but can you stand the heat?"

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 The Arkenstone shines as you pick it up, it's white light red through your
 skin. And you feel it could perhaps do more, if you knew how to unlock
 its secrets..
 It is clear now why Thorin valued the jewel so highly. You resolve to 
 return it to him, even though it is rightfully yours as bounty.

When killing the nemesis:

 As you deal a final blow to Smaug's battered body, the dragon rears its 
 head up into the air on its last strength, and cries out:
 "No! I cannot believe it!" He swings his head around to stare at you 
 again - "YOU? It can't be!"
 With that, the mighty dragon crashes to the floor. You make your way 
 around to his head, carefully avoiding the blood already etching 
 interesting patterns into the stone floor, and deliver a mighty blow to 
 the neck. The whole body jerks and you leap backwards out of the way in 
 time to hear a hiss of breath escape from between the teeth. Never trust a 
 dragon, you smile to yourself. It must surely be dead now, with a large 
 gash in its neck, but to be sure you deliver a few more blows and take 
 the head off completely. Only then do you turn to examine the hoard.

When returning to your quest leader:

 "<playername>! Rumours have been rife that the Smaug has fallen, and I see it 
 must be so! We will reoccupy the Mountain forthwith..
 You have the Arkenstone? Ah, but it does good to see this.. Yet last 
 night Aule appeared to be in a dream - it seems the Arkenstone is to be 
 taken by you on your quest. It will be a victory in itself when its light 
 shines out in Moloch's lair! 
 I would that you had 50 of our best to aid you, but we will need them all 
 in days to come, I fear. So you must make do with my blessing.
 May your beard grow longer and your axe never dull."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Thorin after the quest:

 "Ah, <playername>! How goes your quest for the Amulet?"

When talking to Thorin after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:

 "The Amulet of Yendor.." Thorin raises the profferred amulet and looks 
 at it, before handing it back. "Yes, I can see why Moloch would want it, 
 and why Aule would send you to retrieve it for us.. but your quest is not 
 yet over, <playername>.
 Hence must you journey to the dungeon entrance and out, and with the 
 Amulet you will be sent by the Gods into the Elemental Planes, areas of 
 great danger and strangeness. The Amulet itself may help you find your 
 way through them.
 Survive this and you will find yourself in the Astral Plane. You must go 
 to the temple of <Moradin|Dumathoin> and offer up the Amulet. Good luck."

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You arrive in familiar surroundings.  In the distance, you <see|sense> the
 great stone Circle, the place of worship to Erevan Ilesere.{{note|2}}
 Something is wrong, though.  Surrounding the circle are orcs!
 And they've noticed you!

Next time:
 Once again, you stand before the great Circle of <Earendil|Elwing>.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 You have the oddest feeling that this may be the last time you
 are to enter the great Circle of <Earendil|Elwing>.

===Quest guardians===
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "<playername>!  I have not seen you in many cycles.  How do you fare?"
 "The Goblin King continues to threaten the circle.  But we hold fast."
 "<Earendil|Elwing> is growing weak.  The magic required to defend the circle drains us."
 "Remember the Goblins' Cave is hard to enter.  Seek the secret passageways."
 "We must regain the Palantir of Westernesse.  Without it we will be overrun."

===Quest leader===
When you first meet your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  You have returned!  Thank Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}}.
 "We have great need of you.  But first, I must see if you have the
 required abilities to take on this responsibility."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Once again, <playername>, you stand in our midst.  Are you ready now?"

This message is not currently used:
 "Ah, you are here again, <playername>.  Allow me to determine your readiness..."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "<playername>!  You have doomed us all.  You fairly radiate lawful influences
 and weaken the power we have raised in this circle as a result!
 "Begone!  We renounce your <brother|sister>hood with us!  You are an outcast now!"

When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "<playername>, you are yet too inexperienced to withstand the demands of that
 which we need you to do.  An <Arandur|Aranduriel> might just be able to do this thing.
 "Return to us when you have learned more, my <son|daughter>."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "You have strayed, <playername>!  You know that Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} requires that
 we maintain a pure devotion to things chaotic{{note|3}}!
 "You must go from us.  Return when you have purified yourself."

When finally assigned the quest:
 "You are indeed ready, <playername>.  I shall tell you what has transpired,
 and why we so desperately need your help:
 "A short time ago, the Uruk-Hai tribes of the mountains to the east invaded
 and enslaved the goblin tribes in this area.  The local
 Goblin King is now only a figurehead, and serves the Uruk-hai Overlord. 
 "During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
 orcs and goblins, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
 headed by the Goblin King himself, managed to breach the circle and
 steal the Palantir of Westernesse.
 "Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
 we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.
 "If we are to survive, you, <playername>, must infiltrate
 the Goblins' Cave.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
 underground castle of the Goblin King.  He has always coveted
 the Palantir of Westernesse, and will surely keep it on his person,
 until he delivers it to the Uruk-hai Overlord.
 "Recover the Palantir of Westernesse for us, <playername>!  Only then will 
 the circle of Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} be safe."

====Encouragement====
If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "It is rumored that the Uruk-hai have a pact with the Hill Ogres."
 "The Goblin King is strong, but not very smart."
 "Use the Palantir of Westernesse, when you find it.  It will help you survive to reach us."
 "Remember, let Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} be your guide."
 "Call upon Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} when you face the Goblin King. The very act of doing so will infuriate him, and give you advantage."
 "Though the Goblin King is as chaotic as we, he and kis kind have always hated us."
 "We cannot hold the circle much longer, <playername>.  Hurry!"
 "To infiltrate the Goblins' Cave, you must be very stealthy."
 "Remember that the Goblin King is a braggart.  Trust not what he says."
 "You can triumph, <playername>, if you trust in Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}}."

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 You descend into the outer regions of the Goblins' Cave.  You can hear
 scuffling sounds in the corridors, and vague mumblings in the distance.
 You remember that a High-elf once told you that there were many secret
 passageways in this complex.

When returning:
 Once again, you descend into the Goblins' Cave.

When first entering the goal level:
 You descend into a weird place, in which roughly cut cave-like walls
 join with smooth, finished ones, as if someone was in the midst of
 finishing off the construction of a subterranean complex.
 Off in the distance, you hear a sounds of a large, raucous gathering.

When returning:
 Once again, you enter the distorted castle of the Goblin King.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So, Elf.  <Earendil|Elwing> has sent you to recover the Palantir of Westernesse.
 "Well, I shall keep that bauble.  It pleases me.  You, Elf, shall die."

Upon further meetings:
 "Back again, eh?  Well, a mere <currentrank> is no threat to me!  Die, Elf!"

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "You haven't learned your lesson, Elf.  You can't kill me!  You shall die now."

When you have the Palantir of Westernesse, but the Goblin King is still alive:
 "I shall have the Palantir of Westernesse from you, <currentrank>.  Then I shall
 kill you."

====Discouragement====
The [[Goblin King]] will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "Your Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} is nothing, Elf.  You are mine now!"
 "Run away little Elf!  You can never hope to defeat the Goblin King!"
 "My servants will rip you to shreds!"
 "I shall display your head as a trophy.  What do you think about that wall?"
 "I shall break your <Earendil|Elwing>'s circle, and destroy all the High-elves!"
 "Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} has abandoned you, Elf.  You are doomed."
 "A <currentrank>?  <Earendil|Elwing> sends a mere <currentrank> against me?  Hah!"
 "<Earendil|Elwing> has failed, Elf.  The Palantir of Westernesse will never leave here."
 "You really think you can defeat me, eh Elf?  You are wrong!"
 "You weaken, Elf.  I shall kill you now."

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you pick up the Palantir of Westernesse, it seems to glow, and a warmth
 fills you completely.  You realize that its power is what has protected
 your <brothers|sisters> against their enemies for so long.
 You must now return it to <Earendil|Elwing> without delay -- their lives depend
 on your speed.

When killing the nemesis:
 The Goblin King collapses to the ground, cursing you and <Earendil|Elwing>, then says:
    You have defeated me, <currentrank>!  But I curse you one final time, with my
    dying breath!  You shall die before you leave my castle!

When returning to your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  You have succeeded!  I feared it was not possible!
 "Your aura proclaims that you possess the Palantir of Westernesse!
 "I fear, now, that the Uruk-hai will select yet another Goblin King.
 This will take some time, but if you can recover the Amulet of Yendor
 for Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} before that happens, we will be eternally safe.
 "Take the Palantir of Westernesse with you.  It will aid in your quest for
 the Amulet."

When subsequently throwing the Palantir of Westernesse to Earendil/Elwing:
 "Careful, <playername>!  The Palantir of Westernesse might break, and that would be
 a tragic loss.  You are its keeper now, and the time has come to
 resume your search for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your
 return through the magic portal that brought you here."

===Post-quest===
When talking to Earendil/Elwing after the quest:
 "Welcome, <playername>.  How have you fared on your quest for the Amulet
 of Yendor?"

When talking to Earendil/Elwing after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Utuelyes!  You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor!
 Now attend to me, <playername>, and I will tell you what must be done:
 "The Amulet has within it magic, the capability to transport you to
 the Astral Plane, where the primary circle of Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}} resides.
 "To activate this magic, you must travel upwards as far as you can.
 When you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to Erevan Ilesere{{note|2}}.
 "Thus will you fulfill your destiny."

The stairs are at the marked positions.

The entire level has undiggable walls and floor. Teleportation is permitted. Note that due to the lack of actual walls, magic mapping the level will only show you the location of the down stairs.

In each of the corner chambers is a Grey-elf and a mist wolf; there are an additional four Grey-elves, two mist wolves, and three random d placed around the level.

The entire level has undiggable walls. Teleportation is permitted.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You arrive in frighteningly familiar surroundings.  The black walls of the
 spider goddess's temple loom in the distance.
 Something is wrong, though.  Surrounding the circle are pale surface elves!
 And they've noticed you!

Next time:
 Once again, you stand before the Temple of Lolth.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 You have the oddest feeling that this may be the last time you
 are to enter the Temple of Lolth.

===Quest guardians===
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "<playername>!  Our queen's summons have not been ignored.  Good..."
 "Earendil continues to threaten the circle.  But we hold fast."
 "Lolth is growing weaker.  She regularly eats dark elves to maintain her strength!"
 "Remember, the great Circle of Earendil is hard to enter.  Seek the secret passageways."
 "We must regain the Tentacle Staff.  Without it we will be overrun."

===Quest leader===
When you first meet your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  You have answered the call!
 "I have great need of you.  But first, I must see if you have learned enough
 in your travels."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Once again, <playername>, you return.  Are you ready now?"

This message is not currently used:
 "Ah, you are here again, <playername>.  Allow me to determine your readiness..."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "<playername>!  You have doomed your race.  You fairly radiate lawful influences
 and weaken my power as a result!
 "Begone!  I renounce your <brother|sister>hood with us!  You are an outcast now!"

When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "<playername>, you are yet too inexperienced to withstand the demands of that
 which we need you to do.  An <Arandur|Aranduriel> might just be able to do this thing.
 "Return to us when you have learned more, my <son|daughter>."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "You have strayed, <playername>!  You know that I requires strict
 obediance (sic) and devotion to all things chaotic!
 "You must go from us.  Return when you have purified yourself."

When finally assigned the quest:
 "You are indeed ready, <playername>.  I shall tell you what has transpired,
 and what you must do:
 "A short time ago, weakling surface elves stole into my temple and
 spirited away the Tentacle Staff. With its power gone, my dark elves are
 slowly being overrun by the forces of Earendil.
 "We have been besieged since shortly after your departure.  I do not
 know how much longer your race will survive without the Tentacle Staff.
 "You, <playername>, must infiltrate the great Circle of Earendil.  They have
 established an underground stronghold, and there
 Earendil guards the Tentacle Staff.
 "Recover the Tentacle Staff for us, <playername>!  Only then will the dark elves survive."

====Encouragement====
If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "It is rumored that the surface elves have a pact with the humans."
 "Earendil is devious and untrustworthy."
 "Use the Tentacle Staff, when you find it.  It will help you survive to return."
 "Remember, Lolth has no mercy for the weak."
 "Call upon Lolth when you face Earendil."
 "Earendil has always hated the dark elves."
 "I cannot hold the temple much longer, <playername>.  Hurry!"
 "To infiltrate the great Circle of Earendil, you must be very stealthy."
 "Remember that Earendil is a deceitful braggart."
 "You can triumph, <playername>, if you trust <deity>."

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 You descend into the outer regions of the great Circle of Earendil.  You can hear
 scuffling sounds in the corridors, and vague mumblings in the distance.
 You remember that a drow once told you that there were many secret
 passageways in this complex.

When returning:
 Once again, you descend into the great Circle of Earendil.

When first entering the goal level:
 You descend into a weird place, in which roughly cut cave-like walls
 join with smooth, finished ones, as if someone was in the midst of
 finishing off the construction of a subterranean complex.
 Off in the distance, you hear a sounds of a large, raucous gathering.

When returning:
 Once again, you enter the distorted castle of Earendil.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So, Drow.  Lolth has sent you to recover the Tentacle Staff.
 "It is evil, and I will never allow you to possess it!"

Upon further meetings:
 "Back again, eh?  Well, a <currentrank> is no threat to my faith!"

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "You haven't learned your lesson, Drow.  You cannot defeat me."

When you have the Tentacle Staff, but Earendil is still alive:
 "I shall have the Tentacle Staff from you, <currentrank>.  The dark elves will never reclaim it!"

====Discouragement====
[[Earendil]] will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "Your Lolth is nothing, Drow.  You are defeated!"
 "Run away!  You can never hope to defeat Earendil!"
 "My Elven soldiers will cut you down!"
 "It is never too late to convert one's ways."
 "I shall break your Lolth's temple, and destroy all the drows!"
 "Lolth has abandoned you, Drow.  You are doomed."
 "A <currentrank>?  Lolth sends a mere <currentrank> against me?  She is deperate (sic)..."
 "Lolth has failed, Drow.  The Tentacle Staff will never leave here."
 "You really think you can defeat me, Drow?  You are wrong!"
 "You weaken, Drow.  Flee, or die."

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you pick up the Tentacle Staff, it seems to glow, and an icy chill
 fills you completely.  You realize that its power is what has protected
 the <brothers|sisters> against their enemies for so long.
 You must now return it to Lolth without delay.

When killing the nemesis:
 Earendil collapses to the ground, moaning softly.
    You have defeated me, <currentrank>!  May goodness prevail, despite my
    failure...

When returning to your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  You have succeeded!  I feared it was not possible!
 "Your aura proclaims that you possess the Tentacle Staff!
 Now, if you can recover the Amulet of Yendor, my position will be
 secured.
 "Take the Tentacle Staff with you.  It will aid in your quest for
 the Amulet."

===Post-quest===
When talking to Lolth after the quest:
 "Welcome, <playername>.  How have you fared on your quest for the Amulet
 of Yendor?"

When talking to Lolth after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor!
 Now attend to me, <playername>, and I will tell you what must be done:
 "The Amulet has within it magic, the capability to transport you to
 the Astral Plane, where my primary altar resides.
 "To activate this magic, you must travel upwards as far as you can.
 When you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to <deity>.
 "Thus will you fulfill your destiny."

The two-way magic portal back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point at the bottom right. Bilbo Baggins is on the throne, and there are two proudfoots and a chest in the same building. Inside the chest are an elven mithril-coat, four food rations, and two random rings. There are four proudfoots surrounding the building. Seven of the eight other buildings each contain a peaceful hobbit, and the remaining one is a lawful temple. The hobbit in the upper-rightmost house is standing on the downstair. The town is also populated by two peaceful [[dwarf|dwarves]], a peaceful [[gnome]], and two peaceful [[Green-elf|Green-elves]], all randomly placed. The X mark indicates an engraving reading "Farmer Maggot's Orchard. Private property. Keep out!", and the enclosed area behind it contains two stacks of two apples each, two oranges, a carrot, a banana, a pear, a melon, and [[#Farmer Maggot|Farmer Maggot]] himself. Each is placed randomly at one of the numbered marks in the enclosure. There are two giant eels in the river; other hostile monsters are three kobolds, two large kobolds, a swamp kobold, a rock kobold, a kobold lord, an Uruk-hai, a goblin, a hobgoblin, a cave spider, a giant spider, two other random s, two Nazgul, a barrow wight, and one other random W, all placed at random. The level also contains six pits, two spiked pits, and a rolling boulder trap. The entire level is no-teleport and has a hard floor; all of the walls are undiggable except for the ones around the orchard.

===Upper filler level===

This is an ice-plain level, containing a large kobold, a rock kobold, a swamp kobold, two wargs, two wolves, two killer bees, two cave spiders, a giant spider, two random o, three random h, two random a, two random s; nine random objects; two rolling boulder traps, two pit traps, and four other random traps.
