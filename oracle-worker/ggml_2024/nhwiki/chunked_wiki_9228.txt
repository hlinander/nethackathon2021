The '''spellbook of finger''' in [[SlashTHEM]], teaches the '''finger''' spell. This level 2 [[divination]] spell, not to be confused with [[finger of death]], has the same effect as a [[wand of probing]], revealing a target monster's status and inventory, as well as buried items and the contents of statues and containers. There are a few significant differences, however: 

* "Finger" will not reveal the identity of [[invisible]] creatures. 
* Casting "finger" on peaceful creatures may anger them ([[tame]] creatures are safe). 
* The spell may wake up creatures that are asleep.

Despite these shortcomings, the spell can be a reasonable substitute for the [[wand of probing]] or [[stethoscope]], whenever checking up on your pets or examining non-sleeping hostile monsters from a distance. Unlike the wand of probing, it can be used indefinitely, as long as you have no restrictions on spellcasting and have sufficient [[energy]]. The stethoscope can also be used indefinitely, but does not reveal inventory and can only be used on adjacent monsters.

This spell comes originally from [[NetHack: The Next Generation]].

 |name=acid
 |cost=500
 |type=ray
 |maxcharges=
 |abundance=
 |muse=off
}}
The '''wand of acid''', added in [[SlashTHEM]], shoots an [[acid]]ic [[ray]], similar to a [[yellow dragon]]'s [[breath]] attack. 

Like many other acid-based attacks, the acid ray can [[corrode]] [[iron]] and [[copper]] weapons and armor. Every time an acid ray hits a target, there is a 1 in 6 chance that the target's weapon will be affected and a separate 1 in 6 chance that its armor will be affected. If a player wielding [[Twoweapon|two weapon]]s is hit by the acid, each weapon has a 1 in 3 chance of being affected. 

Being hit by the acid ray will cure [[stoning]]. However, if you [[zap]] yourself with the wand, you will also take 8-48 damage, unless you have [[acid resistance]]. A [[potion of acid]] or an [[acidic]] corpse are safer cures that do less damage.

The acid ray can also destroy [[door]]s. ("The door melts!" or, if you are [[blind]], "You hear sizzling.")

Breaking a wand of acid (by [[apply]]ing) causes an explosion which deals double damage to you and to creatures on surrounding squares.

Attempting to [[engrave]] with a wand of acid returns the message "The bugs on the <floor> seem to be covered in goo!" which can be used to identify the wand, though the wand does not self-identify. Engravings made this way are non-permanent.

The '''wand of wonder''', added in [[SlashTHEM]], has a randomized effect when zapped.

Each time you zap a wand of wonder, one of the following events may occur, each with a 1/21 probability:
{|class="prettytable"
|1
|The surrounding area is illuminated, as with a [[wand of light]].
|-
|2
|Undiscovered [[secret door]]s, [[mimic]]s, and [[trap]]s in the player's vicinity are revealed, as with a [[wand of secret door detection]].
|-
|3
|A monster is created, as with a [[wand of create monster]]. There is a 1/23 chance of creating 2-8 monsters.
|-

|6-12 monsters are generated, as with a [[wand of create horde]].
|-

|"''Multicolored sparks fly from the wand.''" There is a 0.1% chance that this will grant a [[wish]].
|-

|"''You feel self-knowledgeable...''" Grants [[enlightenment]], as with a [[wand of enlightenment]]. This [[exercise]]s [[wisdom]].
|-
|7
|You [[detect monsters]] for 11-30 turns and exercise wisdom. If you already had 300+ turns of monster detection, the wand only adds 10 turns.
|-

|You [[object detection|detect objects]] on the level. This exercises wisdom.
|-

|-
|10
|"''You feel insightful!''" You get to [[identify]] 1-5 items. This exercises wisdom.
|-
|11
|"''You feel like someone is helping you!''" Each cursed item in your pack has a 20% chance of being uncursed.
|-
|12
|"''You feel someone is punishing you for your misbehavior!''" You are [[punish]]ed, as with a [[wand of punishment]].
|}

There is also a 3/7 chance of the wand having no effect. ("''Nothing happens.''")

Every time a wand of wonder is zapped, there is a 1% chance that it will explode, [[Abuse|abusing]] [[strength]].

==Origin==
The wand of wonder originally appeared in [[NetHack: The Next Generation]]. It was inspired by a similar item in the [[roguelike]] [[Angband]], which had a random effect whenever zapped, drawn from the effects of any other wand in that game.

&&%s&& %s Segfault {148527 2022-10-05T01:53:40Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} de-SLEX {{wikipedia|segmentation fault}}

''[[NetHack]]'' '''segfaults''' in certain rare situations where a function expects the game to be in a state that it is not; this always indicates a bug in the code. The most common reason is the nonexistence of something that a function assumes will exist.

== Behaviour ==

Depending on the operating system used, the behavior can be slightly different; on Windows, Nethack closes and often displays a message saying "NETHACK.EXE has stopped working"; on Linux, you normally get a "Segmentation fault" error message printed at whatever location the cursor happens to be onscreen (followed by a prompt); and most public servers will handle the segmentation fault internally and just send you back to the launch screen (eu.un.nethack.nu additionally sends a message to its IRC channel when this happens).

A segfault will leave files on disk exactly as-is, without any attempt to save the game. In most cases (i.e. any codebase that is not derived from [[NitroHack]], with the INSURANCE compile-time configuration option set and the in-game [[options#checkpoint|checkpoint]] option set), the game will be left in a state where it needs [[recover]]y, and after recovery, will return the game to the state at which it was in when the player entered their current dungeon level, or saved (whichever is more recent).

In the case where the game can detect an impossible state before it happens, you get a [[panic]] instead. This has clearer messages than a segfault, and often recovers in a different way, because the game has a chance to handle it. (For example, sometimes you will get an "emergency save" file created.)

==Core dump==
{{man|ulimit}}

If you are working on developing a NetHack [[variant]] (or NetHack itself!) on Linux or Mac OS X, you can configure your terminal so that a segfault leads to a useful "core dump" file that can be opened in a debugger to allow you to know what went wrong. The command to use depends on the operating system and shell you are using. For Linux with <tt>bash</tt>, you can use this command before running the program:

 ulimit -Sc unlimited

{{todo|commands for other shells and operating systems}}

Note that many operating systems will only save one core dump (per program, or per working directory) at a time, so you will need to delete the old one before you can get new ones.

==Variants==

In [[DynaHack]] and [[NetHack 4]] (and theoretically in [[NitroHack]], although the mechanism normally fails in practice), the game will normally be able to recover from a segfault automatically (returning to the start of the turn in DynaHack, or the exact point of the segfault in NetHack 4), although if the bug that caused it has not been fixed in the meantime, the game will normally segfault in the exact same way again.

==The Forge==
[[The Forge]], located between levels 15 and 19 of the [[Dungeons of Doom]], is the home of the Blacksmith, who can forge selected [[artifact weapon]]s for you. It has an 80% chance of being generated.

==The School==
The School, located between levels 8 and 12 of [[Gehennom]], contains teachers, pupils, and a principal. It has an 80% chance of being generated.

==The Computer Level==

The Computer Level, located between levels 8 and 12 of Gehennom, contains several hostile computers. In NHTNG, this is also the only place where certain (mostly nonfunctional) objects will appear. It has an 80% chance of being generated.

==Key Level==
The Key Level, located between levels 5 and 9 of Gehennom, is the home of the nymph queen, the guardian of the Key of Access, which can be invoked to [[branchport]]. It also contains numerous [[nymph]]s and [[leprechaun]]s, all generated awake. It has an 80% chance of being generated.

==Dragon Level==
The Dragon Level, located between levels 1 and 5 of Gehennom, is the home of the Dragon Lord, who drops an artifact set of [[dragon scales]] which can be invoked for a [[breath]] attack. It has an 60% chance of being generated.

In SlashTHEM the Dragon Lord appears in [[the Wyrm Caves]].

==The Hitchhiker's Level==
The Hitchhiker's Level, located one to two levels above [[Medusa's Island]], is a tribute to [[Douglas Adams]] and his ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' series. It contains a number of monsters that represent characters from the series or otherwise allude to it.

The layout of the Computer Level is simple: a [[big room]] with the upstairs and downstairs in small enclosures in opposite corners.

Randomly located throughout the level are a PDP-9, PDP-11, VAX, and a Cray (all using the {{white|x}} symbol); a news daemon, a printer daemon, and a UNIX Kernel (all using the {{white|&}} symbol), and six bugs and two heisenbugs (all {{white|x}}). 

At random locations on the ground are a ring of timely backup, a scroll of root password detection, amulet of data storage, and a wand of bugging.

In [[SlashTHEM]]<!--verify--> there is a second variation of this level in which the designated computers and bugs are replaced by random monsters that use the [[x]] symbol, and the daemons and UNIX Kernel are replaced by random [[&]]. A third contains the original monsters as well as: a random [[I]], two random [[sea monster]]s, and a number of [[boulder]]s, [[egg]]s, [[scroll]]s, [[corpse]]s, and other items.

==Items==
In NHTNG these items are only generated on the Computer Level, and are all (with the exception of the wand of bugging) nonfunctional, only displaying a [[YAFM|humorous message]] when worn/read. They will disappear from your inventory if you leave the level with them.

In SlashTHEM<!--verify--> these items may be randomly generated, do not disappear from your inventory, and have more serious implications for gameplay.

===Ring of timely backup===
{{ring
  |name=timely backup
  |cost=300
}}
Putting on the '''ring of timely backup''' returns the message "You feel absolutely safe." This sense of security is misleading, as the ring does not affect you in any way, except occupying one of your ring slots.

In SlashTHEM<!--verify-->monsters can use the ring of timely backup to heal themselves, reducing its [[enchantment]] by one point each time.

{{clear}}
===Scroll of root password detection===
{{scroll
  |name=root password detection
  |cost=300
  |ink=4-7
  |muse=def
}}
Reading the '''scroll of root password detection''' reveals the supposed "root password" of your computer: "xyzzy" if uncursed, "memalezu" if blessed, and "jsdfljfdsh" if cursed. This revelation does not impact your gameplay in any way, except using up a turn.

In SlashTHEM<!--verify--> a monster that reads this scroll can [[levelport]]. Many unique monsters (including [[Demon#Unique demons|demon princes and lord]]s) will be generated with this scroll, which they will use to escape the player if their health gets low.

XYZZY is also the random text label associated with this scroll in the code, though as the scroll appearance is randomized this will rarely be its actual appearance. "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xyzzy_(computing) Xyzzy]" is a reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure ''Colossal Cave Adventure''], one of the first adventure video games. Entering the command "xyzzy" in a certain room of the cave sends the player immediately to another room some distance away, effectively serving as a shortcut. The word has been referenced in many games (and even some non-game programs) as an homage to this early game. 

{{clear}}

===Amulet of data storage===
{{amulet
  |name=data storage
  |cost=150
}}
Putting on the '''amulet of data storage''' returns the message: "You feel full of knowledge." and taking it off will display "You feel intellectually poor." As ominous as this may sound, it does not affect you in any way.

In SlashTHEM <!--verify anyway-->(post version 0.7.0) the amulet slows [[Spellcasting#Forgotten spells|spell memory loss]] to 2/3 of its usual rate and protects against the effects of [[amnesia]], when worn by the player. This function is inspired by the [https://bilious.alt.org/?270 Ring of Memory] patch.
{{clear}}

===Wand of bugging===
{{wand
  |name=bugging
  |cost=500
  |type=non-directional
}}
Zapping a '''wand of bugging''' creates 1-6 creatures, each of which has a 66% chance of being a bug and a 33% chance of being a heisenbug.

 |name=fear

}}
The '''wand of fear''' is a wand in [[SLASH'EM]]<ref>{{sourcecode|objects.c|1160|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>. Zapping it at a target causes the target to become [[scare]]d and [[flee]] ("<foo> suddenly panics!")<ref>{{sourcecode|zap.c|266|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>. Monsters with sufficient [[magic resistance (monster)|MR]] may resist being scared, and [[undead]] targets will not be affected.

The wand has a base value of 200, equal to that of the wands of [[wand of cancellation|cancellation]], [[wand of create monster|create monster]], [[wand of polymorph|polymorph]], and [[wand of teleportation|teleportation]].

Attempting to [[engrave]] with a wand of fear returns the message "The bugs on the <floor> run away!" The wand will not self-identify, though this is the only wand that will have this effect.

==Strategy==

The wand of fear gives combat pragmatists a new option for scaring away monsters they do not want to fight. Its advantages are that it does not depend on vulnerable environmental factors (like [[Elbereth]] or a dropped [[scroll of scare monster]]), does not require spellcasting [[energy]] (as casting [[Spellbook of cause fear|cause fear]] or [[Spellbook of turn undead|turn undead]] would), and does not awaken sleeping monsters (as a [[tooled horn]] or [[leather drum]] would). Its disadvantages are that it is limited by its number of [[charge]]s, only affects monsters that are zapped with it, can be resisted, and has no effect on the undead. 

In spite of these disadvantage, a wand of fear can be a useful [[escape item]] in certain situations, as when there is a single enemy you want to scare away, one that has a low magic resistance and is not undead.

As with other methods of scaring monsters, players should remember that fleeing monsters can still use ranged attacks, and that attacking a fleeing opponent is a [[Knight#Honor in combat|cowardly]] act for [[Knight]]s.

&&%s&& %s Racial equipment {150056 2023-03-05T07:43:51Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Elves */* The array of weapons, armor, and other items available in ''[[NetHack]]'' include many items that are associated with one of the starting [[race]]s, and may be infomally considered '''racial equipment'''.

==Description==
In ''NetHack'', items may be linked to a specific race because:

#They are described as belonging to (made/used by) that race (e.g. dwarvish and elven [[mithril-coat]]s), or
#They are more likely to appear in the inventory of [[monster]]s and players of that race (e.g. the [[aklys]] and [[crossbow]] for [[gnome]]s) than other pieces of equipment, often because of the first point.

Racial associations only impact gameplay during character generation, where some roles may receive racial substitutes for standard items (e.g. an [[elven dagger]] or [[orcish dagger]] instead of a regular [[dagger]]), and when calculating bonuses such as for example, [[to-hit]], [[damage]] or [[multishot]] when using a matching bow and arrows. In [[Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/objects.c|the objects code]], there are no variables (besides the object names) that mark items as belonging to any particular race.

While there is no in-game incentive to use racial equipment, players may choose to do so out of either personal preference or adherence to an [[Unofficial conduct#Racial|unofficial "racial" conduct]]; beyond this, most players will use the best options available to them.

==List of equipment by race==
Below is a concise list of weapons and other equipment sorted by their associated race.

===Humans===
No items in ''NetHack'' are specifically said to be unique to the [[Human (starting race)|human]] race. Perhaps humans make the items that are not specifically described as elven, dwarvish, gnomish, or orcish.

The fact that human craftsmanship in NetHack does not seem worth mentioning might be in keeping with humans being generally "average" as a starting race.

===Elves===
Elves are allergic to [[iron]], so they do not use it in their items.

Elven weapons are described as "runed" and are all made of [[wood]], which does not rust or corrode but is vulnerable to [[rot]]ting or [[burn]]ing by [[passive attack#Fire|passive fire attacks]]; these weapons are likely based on the [http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ironwood ironwood] found in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' media. Elven shields are also made of wood.

As a general rule, elven armor has slightly lower [[AC]] values than its dwarven equivalents, but all types of elven armor can be safely enchanted to +7.

The elven cloak replaces the starting [[cloak of displacement]] for elven [[Ranger]]s.

====Other elven items====
* [[Lembas wafer]]s replace the stack of [[cram ration]]s for Rangers.
* Elven [[Priest]]s and [[Wizard]]s start with a nonmagical [[musical instrument]].

===Dwarves===
Dwarvish armor options generally offer some of the highest base AC values in the game. The dwarvish mithril-coat is inferior only to the [[plate mail|iron]] and [[crystal plate mail]]s, and [[dragon scale mail]], but its good weight-to-AC ratio gives it an advantage over the plate mails. The dwarvish cloak is a possible exception to the advantages of dwarvish armor, with its base AC of zero. The dwarvish mattock is one of the most powerful non-artifact weapons.

|}

While not explicitly described as dwarvish, [[iron shoes]] are often worn by [[dwarf (monster)|dwarves]].

===Gnomes===
[[Crossbow]]s and [[crossbow bolt]]s are explicitly noted as gnomish racial weapons{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|230|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} - Gnomish [[Ranger]]s will start with a crossbow and bolts, rather than the usual bow and arrows, and are currently the only case where such a substitution applies.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|115|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Gnomes also receive a +1 [[multishot]] bonus when firing bolts from of a crossbow, and have a lower minimum [[strength]] threshold to fire multiple bolts at once. This also creates an unfortunate situation for gnomish Rangers, as their [[quest artifact]] the [[Longbow of Diana]] does not grant multishot bonuses when firing from it, and they must train up the separate [[bow]] skill in order to utilize it.

While player and non-player gnomes do not have any other racial equipment, the [[aklys]] is heavily associated with them due to the frequency of [[Gnome (monster class)|gnomes]] wielding one, especially in the early game within the [[Gnomish Mines]]. Non-player gnomes generated randomly outside of the [[Rogue level]] qualify for the default weapon sets generated in the [[monster starting inventory]] of non-[[strong]] [[humanoid]]s that can wield weapons:{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|512|version=NetHack 3.6.6|name="default"|common=Default set of cases for monster weapon generation}} T a stack of [[dart]]s, a [[crossbow]] and some crossbow bolts, a [[bow]] and 3-14 [[arrow]]s, a stack of [[dagger]]s, or an aklys, with an equal probability of each and increased odds for gnome lords and gnome kings. The aklys is often considered to be the only suitable melee weapon for a gnomish racial ascension because of this.

===Orcs===
Orcish armor and weapons are characteristically described as "crude".  The base AC of orcish armor is generally one point less than that of its generic equivalent&mdash;even [[studded leather armor]] is better than an orcish ring mail.

|}

==Variants==
Many variants add more types of race-specific equipment, and some provide additional incentives to use them, such as an extra point of [[AC]] per article or a bonus to [[charisma]]. This can also overlap with [[object materials]] systems where objects can be composed of different materials depending on whether they were, for example, dwarvish-made versus elven-made.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], non-player gnomes have a chance of being generated with a [[candle]], especially if on a dark level of the [[Gnomish Mines]].

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], on top of equipment being race-specific, it can also come in different sizes as well. This means that giants will often be generated with huge weapons, while gnomes can only equip small-sized armor and are generated with small weapons. Gnomes and other small monsters require both hands to wield medium weapons above a certain size (i.e. long swords are two-handed for gnomes, but short swords can be used with one hand).

All player and monster gnomes start with '[[gnomish pointy hat]]s' that can be used as a temporary, candle-like light source. Player gnomes also have bullwhips or clubs replaced with an aklys, and crossbows replacing normal bows; they can always train club and crossbow to expert regardless of role.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], you and other monsters gain a bonus point of AC for each piece of race-specific armor worn, and armor made of a certain material also has certain effects depending on which type of monster wears it. This is done in order to further flesh out various monster types, including many of the new monsters as well as [[racial monster]]s (which are implemented in a somewhat similar manner to [[GruntHack]]).

* '''Dwarves'''
** Iron shoes are now [[dwarvish boots]]; dwarvish mithril-coats are also changed to [[dwarvish chain mail]], which when made of mithril function very similar to mithril-coats.
** Dwarves gain the [[dwarvish bearded axe]], a type of [[axe]] that can be generated as a weapon for player and non-player dwarves. Its damage is comparable to a [[long sword]], and it can also be used to disarm monsters and remove their weapons or shields, similar to [[bullwhip]]s.
** Starting inventories for player dwarves have race-based substitutions that replace regular helmets with dwarvish helms and long swords with dwarvish bearded axes.
** Non-cloth items of dwarven make have the following material distribution:
*** 60% iron
*** 20% steel
*** 15% mithril
*** 3% silver
*** 1% gold
*** 1% platinum
* '''Elves'''
** Iron is a hated material for elves in EvilHack - wearing or wielding anything made of iron that touches the skin will prevent hit point regeneration for player and monster elves and cause 1d8 physical damage on initial contact; player elves wielding iron without gloves incur a -1 [[Luck]] penalty. Iron also deals +1d8 bonus damage to any elven monster it hits, and elves will avoid using items made of iron where possible.
** Elves are given the [[elven long sword]], which has a base material of wood like other elven weapons rather than [[iron]]. The elven long sword is also lighter than a normal long sword, with damage closer to that of the [[katana]], but is vulnerable to erosion from burning and rotting.
** Starting inventories for player elves are adjusted so that weapons and armor are not made of a harmful material; most of this is handled by expanding race-based substitutions for elves, and any iron weapons not covered by those substitutions (e.g. the [[mace]] of an elven [[Priest]]) are given a special case that converts them to [[copper]].
** Mithril armor also grants [[MC]]3 when worn by elves, compared to MC2 for other races.
** Non-cloth items of elven make have the following material distribution:
*** 60% normal base material (e.g. wood for elven weapons and shields, metal for elven chain mail)
*** 20% wood
*** 10% copper
*** 5% mithril
*** 3% silver
*** 2% gold
* '''Orcs'''
** Mithril is a hated material for orcs in EvilHack, in the same vein as elves - wearing or wielding mithril that makes skin contact deals 1d8 damage and prevents passive regeneration, and wielding mithril without gloves incurs a -1 Luck penalty. Mithril deals +1d8 bonus damage to orcish monsters, and orcs will avoid mithril items when possible. Orcish [[Knight]]s can still gain access to the mithril [[Dirge]] via same-race sacrifice and wield it safely with some form of [[gloves]], which all Knights start the game with.
** While there are additionally race-based substitutions to replace any starting item made of mithril with an iron equivalent for player orcs, there are currently no items that qualify for this substitution, since the material of starting items is generally fixed.
** [[Scimitar]]s and iron shoes generated on orcs are replaced with orcish equivalents - [[orcish scimitar]]s deal slightly less damage against small monsters, and [[orcish boots]] that have a lower base AC than iron shoes, but grant the same AC when worn by orcs. Player and non-player orcs can also generate with [[orcish long sword]]s, which deal slightly less damage against large monsters compared to normal long swords. Finally, the [[orcish morning star]] is a significantly weaker form of [[morning star]] that is most often generated in the hands of [[goblin outrider]]s and [[goblin-captain]]s.
** Armor made of [[bone]] and [[stone]] grants MC3 when worn by orcs.
** Non-cloth items of orcish make have the following material distribution:
*** 65% iron
*** 25% bone
*** 10% stone
* '''Gnomes'''
** Gnomish Rangers will get [[The Crossbow of Carl]] as their quest artifact, whichis a very close equivalent to the Longbow of Diana: it weighs the same in gnomish hands as a normal bow would when carried by other races, can be [[invoke]]d to create crossbow bolts, and grants gnomes their racial multishot bonus when firing bolts from it.
* '''Hobbits'''
** Starting inventories for player hobbits will use elven gear where possible, which parallels the tendency of non-player hobbits to use elven weapons and armor themselves.

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, [[SlashTHEM]] adds gnomish armor:

* [[Gnomish helm]] ("little red hat")
* [[Gnomish suit]] ("little blue vest")
* [[Gnomish boots]] ("little black boots")

These items have no base [[AC]], though gnomish players gain a +2 AC bonus for each piece of gnomish armor they wear.

I just want to point out maybe a bug...
I had a blessed bag of holding and put it into another blessed bag of holding. The result was I ended up with no bag of holding, just the stuff in main inventory. It was few games ago so no bad feelings about it since I managed to ascend.

No, that is not a bug. There are certain items which cannot go inside a bag of holding, consult [[Bag of Holding|it's article]] for more details.[[User:Catullus|Catullus]] ([[User talk:Catullus|talk]]) 13:15, 29 November 2015 (UTC)

== Facing nasties - help needed ==

Hi,
I'm in situation that on the Medusa Island there are waiting for me next to the stairs: Titan summoning nasties, 2 master mindflyiers, 2 minotaurs, ettin, some dragon (not black so he could disintegrate)... plus there are 3 demilichies on the floor.

Till now I was looting thrones and polyping scrolls in hope to get scroll of genocide. I became (barbarian) lvl 28 through all the droped potions with ac -28, 311hp, +7 Sunsword, +2 silver saber, gdsm, amulet of reflection...

How should I proceed? I'm thinking of 2 ways
1. Running to Castle for the wand, if I can dig through floors... But I dont know where will I appear on the Island when digging down (in water?)
2. Reading blessed scroll of Earth in hopes to create space around me to push mindflyiers (although i don't know if it would work)... Or going down with a lot of pets that would make some room for me?

Can anybody advice?
Thanks in advance--[[User:Kefir|Kefir]] ([[User talk:Kefir|talk]]) 10:26, 29 November 2015 (UTC)Kefir

Engrave [[Elbereth]] on the upstairs. Also, BTW, titans are non-genocidable.[[User:Catullus|Catullus]] ([[User talk:Catullus|talk]]) 13:15, 29 November 2015 (UTC)}
&&%s&& %s Archonstorm {150236 2023-03-13T23:39:05Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} ver '''"Archonstorm"''' is a nickname given to a situation in ''[[NetHack]]'' where a player ends up facing a large group of [[Archon]]s.

==Description==

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Summon nasties can no longer create monsters of equal or higher difficulty than the caster (preventing, e.g., arch-liches or Archons from summoning more of themselves).}}

While Archons are formidable foes all on their own, a disproportionate number may spawn if the player has [[genocide]]d several other high-level monsters; the Archon is also more liable to summon another Archon via the [[summon nasties]] spell as a result. In a worst-case scenario, this can become a chain of summons that grows exponentially and fills most of the level with Archons. This usually occurs on the [[Elemental Planes]] in the [[endgame]], but is most commonly seen on the [[Plane of Fire]], as it is the most open of the eligible levels; it also occasionally happens on the [[Plane of Air]], and very rarely on other planes.

==Strategy==
The player caught in an Archonstorm is likely doomed: even if they have a means of driving off the Archons and gaining breathing room, they are very likely to be swarmed and surrounded by the other Archons and remaining nasties. [[Conflict]] may or may not have any effect due to the Archons' [[monster magic resistance]], and unless your AC is incredibly high, you may be struck down before you can get clear of them. As such, Archonstorms in particular are a major reason why it is discouraged to perform excessive genociding of monsters.

The '''Advent Calendar''' is a patch by [[User:Bhaak|Patric Mueller]], originally written against [[NetHack 3.4.3]].  It has been incorporated into several variants, including [[UnNetHack]], [[DynaHack]], [[NetHack Fourk]], and possibly others.

The patch adds a special level, the Advent Calendar, which is only reachable during the month of December, via a [[magic portal]] on one of the early levels in the main [[Dungeons of Doom]] branch. The portal is only generated in December.

The level itself contains 24 small rooms, each protected by [[undiggable]], [[phasing|unphaseable]] walls and an initially locked artifact door, which is indestructible and cannot be bypassed or unlocked by normal means.  Unlike the artifact doors in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNetHack]], no corresponding artifact key is generated, so the doors cannot be opened until they unlock.  Engravings on the ground outside each door number them from 1 to 24.  Additionally, pieces of colored [[glass]] are scattered around the level for atmosphere, and there are several [[tree]]s.

Each door unlocks if the level is visited on the corresponding day of the month.  Most of the doors contain a minor treat, such as a piece of food; however, the twenty-fourth door contains a "Christmas present", which is typically a more desirable item -- in some cases a magic tool.

== Messages ==

'''NetHack 3.6.0''' is the 30th public release of [[NetHack]] and the 26th by the [[DevTeam]]. It was announced and released on the official NetHack website on 7 December 2015.<ref>[http://nethack.org/ nethack.org - Home Page]</ref>

== Availability ==

NetHack 3.6.0 [http://nethack.org/v360/downloads.html is readily available] from the official NetHack website. Binaries are provided for [http://nethack.org/v360/ports/download-win.html MS Windows (version 7 or later)] and [http://nethack.org/v360/ports/download-mac.html Mac OS X (version 10.7 "Lion" or later)], and [http://nethack.org/v360/download-src.html the source code is available], so people can port NetHack 3.6.0 to other platforms, something the DevTeam encourages [http://nethack.org/v360/release.html in the release notes].  [[User:Ray Chason|Ray Chason]] [https://github.com/chasonr/nethack-3.6.0-patches/releases/tag/v1.1.2-msdos has managed] to get the DJGPP DOS port working; it is [https://github.com/chasonr/nethack-3.6.0-patches/releases/tag/v1.1.2-msdos available on github].

== Significant changes ==

NetHack 3.6.0 is described by the DevTeam as consisting of "a series of foundational changes in the team, underlying infrastructure and changes to the approach to game development".<ref>http://nethack.org/v360/release.html</ref> It focuses on these internal changes more than on the addition of new content, but there are still some features introduced in this version, including many small changes throughout the game.

Notable changes in NetHack 3.6.0 include:
*[[Elbereth]] was weakened in several ways:
**It no longer protects squares you're not in.
**It must be at the beginning of an engraving; multiple consecutive Elbereths no longer protect against erosion.
**It doesn't work in [[Gehennom]] or the [[Endgame]].
**It has a chance of eroding every time it protects you, and even a burned Elbereth can fade.
*[[Magic cancellation]] is harder to get (e.g. [[cloak of magic resistance|cloak of MR]]: MC3→MC1) and also a little less effective (e.g. MC3: 98%→90% protection). To mitigate this a little a [[ring of protection]] raises MC by 1. Still, together with the weaker Elbereth, [[killer bee]]s have become a lot more deadly.
*The [[javelin]] skill was merged with [[spear]].
*[[Statue]]s are now rendered in white with the same symbol as the monster they are representing, instead of {{white|`}}.
*More randomized appearances of [[scrolls]].
*Lower chances of [[Magic marker|writing]] unknown scrolls as a wizard. Type-naming no longer makes it safe.
*[[Kick]]ing a pile of gold now sends gold pieces flying in every direction.
*[[Pet]]s now pick up only a single piece of gold, making [[credit cloning]] impossible without a [[container]].
*Correctly rounded [[shop]] price calculation makes [[price identification|price IDing]] slightly harder.
*[[Farming]] was nerfed in various ways: [[pudding]]s no longer leave corpses or death drops, [[kraken]] cannot be revived on land, horns from reviving [[unicorns]] are worthless for [[polypiling]].
*[[Alchemy|Alchemizing]] potions will only convert 2 to 9 potions at a time instead of the entire stack.
*Being [[crowned]] gives the player an extra skill slot.
*[[Iron bar]]s now sometimes betray [[closet]]s.
*New shop type: health food, stocking only [[Conduct#Vegetarian|vegetarian]] food, and ([[Potion of full healing|full]]) [[Potion of healing|healing]] potions instead of [[Potion of booze|booze]].
*[[Sokoban]] puzzles no longer track cheating after they are fully solved. Prize no longer depends on 4th level's layout.
*Some [[Minetown]] level changes. Most importantly [[Minetown#Orcish_Town|one variant]] has been overrun by [[Orc (monster class)|orcs]], which means no shops, no [[Aligned priest|priest]] and hardly any worthwhile loot. At least the unaligned [[altar]] can always be easily converted, without a priest defending it.
*One [[Mines' End]] layout has been slightly randomized.
*The [[Big Room]] introduces many more variants plus some randomized floor types, with even a chance of a lava maze with a [[minotaur]]!
*Some [[Quest]] levels changed e.g. a swamp was added to the [[Wizard quest#The_Tower_of_Darkness|Tower of Darkness]].
*Two new [[Medusa's Island|Medusa]] levels. As a side effect this means only 1/4 chance of a [[titan]] instead of 1/2.
*The layout of the [[Valley of the Dead]] may vary now.
*[[Gehennom]]-type mazes may now consist of corridors instead of walls.
*Due to a bug the [[Wizard of Yendor|Wizard]] can wake up prematurely if a hostile spellcaster casts [[monster spell|aggravate monster]]. It's highly advisable not to linger on his level until you're ready for him.
*The [[vibrating square]] is treated as a trap and can be found quickly by the [[scroll of gold detection|usual]] [[Crystal ball|means]].
