== Simurgh, who roosts on the Tree of Life ==
{{encyclopedia|

If I were the rain that binds together the earth and the sky, who in all eternity will never mingle, would I be able to bind the hearts of people together?
[ Bleach, by Tite Kubo ]

The simurgh is depicted in Iranian art as a winged creature in the shape of a bird, gigantic enough to carry off an elephant or a whale. It appears as a peacock with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion - sometimes, however, also with a human face. The simurgh is inherently benevolent and unambiguously female.

"Si-", the first element in the name, has been connected in folk etymology to Modern Persian si ("thirty"). Although this prefix is not historically related to the origin of the name simurgh, "thirty" has nonetheless been the basis for legends incorporating that number - for instance, that the simurgh was as large as thirty birds or had thirty colours (siræng).

Iranian legends consider the bird so old that it had seen the destruction of the world three times over. The simurgh learned so much by living so long that it is thought to possess the knowledge of all the ages.

= The Two Spirits of the Gate =
The following two spirits may only be bound by a Binder, even if their seals are found in bones. They both occupy a special slot that no other spirit occupies, so they are mutually exclusive only to each other. Both are intimately tied into the [[Binder quest (dNetHack)|Binder Quest]].

== Dahlver-Nar, the First Binder ==
{{encyclopedia|
[...] Binder scholars know a different story—that Dahlver-Nar was a powerful cleric who forsook his deity to pursue the power of pact magic. The fabled teeth of Dahlver-Nar, to which all the legends attribute miraculous powers, were neither his own nor those of the dragon he battled. They were the teeth of beings that became vestiges after death, and they could grant abilities similar to those that the vestiges themselves imparted. Pact magic treatises relate that Dahlver-Nar pulled out his own teeth and replaced them with those of the vestiges, but that using them all drove him mad. What happened thereafter is a matter of debate, but the texts maintain that Dahlver-Nar eventually died, and the teeth were lost, divided up among the squabbling followers he had managed to gain and then spread across the world. Today, Dahlver-Nar exists as a vestige in his own right—perhaps brought to that state through his close association with so many others.

[ Tome of Magic, by Matthew Sernett et al. ]

Then they stamp,
Then they stand still.

{{encyclopedia|
 Ages past, a human magic-user/cleric of sur-
passing evil took the steps necessaly to preserve his life force
beyond the centuries he had already lived, and this creature
became the lich, Acererak. Over the scores of years which fol-
lowed, the lich dwelled with hordes of ghastly servants in the
gloomy stone halls of the very hill where the Tomb is. Eventu-
ally even the undead life force of Acererak began to wane, so
for the next 8 decades, the lich’s servants labored to create the
Tomb of Horrors. Then Acererak destroyed all of his slaves and
servitors, magically hid the entrance to his halls, and went to
his final haunt, while his soul roamed strange planes unknown
to even the wisest of sages.

{{encyclopedia|
Shardminds are sentient fragments of the living Gate, which once stood at the pinnacle of the intricate lattice of the Astral Sea. Beyond that gate lay the alien Far Realm, and the gate's destruction during the Dawn War resulted in the rise of the mind flayer empire. Though Ioun's power holds the portal closed, shardminds seek to rebuild the gate and forever cut off the Far Realm's ability to influence the world. 

Shardminds say that the Living Gate shattered into countless fragments, and each time an awakened shardmind is killed, another one somewhere in the universe stirs to consciousness.

== Miska, the Wolf-Spider ==
{{encyclopedia|
A canvas's colors of blood and ichor soak the ground upon the fields of Pesh, mountains of corpses surrounding a creature whose body wavers between forms arachnid and lupine. Miska the Wolf-Spyder.

The wind dukes and their servants (slaves?) are falling, the former comets being doused and the latter as if a wind put darkens a field of candles. One duke is a pillar for the forces of Law and its allies, shining in its gorgeous androgyne nudity despite the vastness of Miska's shadow which flows through forms like quicksilver. In his hand is a simple black rod, elegant in its minimalism as befitting the nature of its orderly creators. 

What happens next is unclear - those who might have recalled these moments better are lost even to the great powers shining their light on this ancient past. One of the wind dukes that was there before the tide of the demonic horde fell upon them is dead, his body torn by gaping but perfectly circular holes. One of the Vaati has speared the body of the Miska the Wolf-Spyder, who is in his drider like form, his eye-holes pouring out light that strangely resembles rotted gold.
[ Blade of Innocence, Sciborg ]

Stricken, Miska wailed in anguish, and his screams were so terrible that every soldier on the battlefield was briefly transfixed. As Miska writhed in agony, his foul blood covered and penetrated the Rod. As the absolute Law imbued in the Rod mingled with the Chaos in Miska's blood, the fabric of the multiverse was ripped asunder. The Rod shattered into seven pieces and Miska was cast through a planar rift. The hordes of Chaos surged to the scene, but the Rod bearer gathered up the fragments and dove through the rift, sealing it.
[ The Rod of Seven Parts, Skip Williams ]

== The Alignment Thing ==
{{encyclopedia|
It is called the Alignment Thing, and the Storm of Ideals. It is called Mother and Father. None of these phrases truly encapsulate what it is.

It is at once a creature, a planar layer, and a disturbance within the multi-dimensional matrix of Outside. It is a storm. It is an infection, bleeding astral pus. It is a parasite. It is another level of being. It is a community, a tribe, a memetic ecology, a multiverse in itself. It is bodiless mind. It is an endless sea of bodies. It is a war. It is love. It is sex. It is hunger. It is fear.

It is the accumulation of alien philosophies in the Realm Outside. It is Law, Chaos, Good, Evil, and Balance collected and reinterpreted, digested and recreated in the other, alien reality beyond space and time. Somehow, these forces have gained an altogether new sentience, neither unified nor separate, a great spiraling current around an unseen attractor. It is alive.

Like most living things, it seeks to grow and propagate itself. Therefore it seeks portals into the Great Wheel from which its original substance comes so that it may gather more of these thoughts so foreign to its dimension and so familiar to our own.

For this reason the Storm of Ideals is often the first layer encountered by those foolish enough to cross the veil of Eternity and explore the unfathomable Beyond.

A staggering variety of creatures inhabit and make up the substance of the Storm, each becoming stranger and more complex with every movement. The beings who make up the Thing continually exchange parts of their bodies and essence, never remaining the same for long. This is the current that fuels the Storm.

Any who touch the substance of the Alignment Thing assumes an alignment subtype - either Good, Evil, Lawful, Chaotic, or none. Sometimes more than one subtype is gained. This subtype is permanent, probably the only permanent thing an inhabitant of the Storm of Ideals will ever know again as everything from bones and sinew to spell-like or psi-like abilities are exchanged with those up and downstream. The possessor of this subtype need not live up to it in their deeds and actions, since the alien nature of that which bequeathed it understands these notions very poorly. However, most will be influenced by their subtype to some extent.

The literal meaning is simply "a nod", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, "that which is produced by nodding", just as flamen is "that which is produced by blowing", i.e., a gust of wind. It came to mean "the product or expression of power" — not, be it noted, power itself.

[ H. J. Rose ]
}}

'''Binding Ritual'''

The Numina can only be bound by 30th level Binders. The seal is silently learned once the Binder reaches level 30.

'''Taboo'''

The Numina's pact breaks if the Binder ever loses a level.

'''Mark'''

The Binder is surrounded by whispers.

The whispers can only be hear up close. The whispers can not be disguised.

'''Immunity'''

The Numina grant immunity to [[stun]] and [[confusion]].

'''Skill'''

The Numina allows access to all skills, but does not unrestrict nor grant a bonus to any skill.

'''Active Powers'''
*'''Identify''': Identifies inventory.
*'''Clairvoyance''': Map the local area.
*'''Find the Path''': Detect nearby magic portals.
*'''Gnostic Premonition''': Allows use of Gnostic Premonition despite having spirits bound (Bind any spirit of your choice for 5 turns). Cooldown is 25 turns instead of 125.

'''Passive Powers'''
*'''Whispersense''': Intrinsic monster detection

= The Spirit of Shadow =
This spirit is the only spirit that Binders do not naturally have access to. Female myrkalfar (drow) Anachrononauts are permanently bound to it as part of their starting kit. Lawful male droven Priests, Rangers, Rogues, or Wizards learn the seal upon being crowned and can bind it conventionally. It occupies the same slot as the quest spirits (the Spirits of the Gate), and for Binders who learn this seal, it will behave the same when binding as them.

== The Black Web Entity ==
{{encyclopedia|
The Black Web is a Far Realms entity that represents an inversion of the natural order; in which the shadows cast by webs are imbued with agency, and the thoughts and actions of living things flow deterministically from the choices of these shadows.
[ The Great Scribe ]
}}

'''Binding Ritual'''

The seal must be engraved on a lit square containing a web. This is flavored as using the shadow of the web.

'''Taboo'''

None.

'''Mark'''

Your shadow is wrapped in the black web. This black web can be seen if you're in a lit square and not invisible.

'''Immunity'''

None.

'''Skill'''

None.

'''Active Powers'''
*'''Black Bolt''': Fires a poisoned stained shining shadowsteel spike in a given direction. The enchantment of the spike is 8+5d(spirit dice). This spike phases through walls to to hit a target. When it hits the target, creates a web and traps the target inside.
*'''Weave a Black Web''': For the next 5 turns, makes 4d8 shadowblade attacks to all adjacent hostile monsters. Hitting a monster during this period will trigger this again, but excluding the struck monster.

'''Passive Powers'''
*'''Affinity for Entanglement''': You gain a -8 bonus to AC and +8 movement points when trapped in a web. You cannot destroy webs by any means, but tearing, burning, etc. out of a web will free you instantly as normal.
*'''Sharpened Shadows''': Your unarmed attacks are replaced with 4d8 shadowy spiritual weapon attacks known as shadowblades. As spiritual weapon attacks they bypass AC/DR, but aren't guaranteed to hit shades/etc. like shining weapons. Shadowblades are always poisoned with normal poison. These attacks don't count as hitting with a wielded weapon or get any strength/skill/etc. bonus damage, but also get no unarmed combat bonuses from gloves, rings, or similar. Additionally, you can two-weapon with an empty offhand (which is replaced by a shadowblade), even if you couldn't normally two-weapon due to role or race restrictions, but subject to any bimanual two-weaponing restrictions.

A '''kuker''' (plural: '''kukeri''') is a merchant found in the [[dNetHack]] Lost Cities. Each level there above Gulf of N'Kai can have up to 2 kukeri, with a 7% chance each. Each kukeri has an insight limit as well, ranging from 1-40. 

Kuker are always generated with a +7 wooden weapon with the holy and red-hot [[Object_properties#Weapons|object properties]]. It has a 50% chance to be a scimitar, a 25% chance to be a quarterstaff, and a 25% chance to be a spear. They also are always generated with a normal bell.

The primary purpose of a kukeri is to offer services you can't find anywhere else. These services are reusable, with the exception of sanctification, which removes the kuker along with all non-unique items it is carrying. Some of these services will not be available unless you meet their criteria. 

They are most useful in sanctifying weapons. This can be used to add a large amount of extra damage to any weapon, so you can upgrade your current endgame weapon to be even better, or make a less viable weapon more effective. The complete dungeon, minus Fort Ludios, can barely end up with enough gold to sanctify two weapons, but it's unlikely that you'll even find two kukeri to sanctify with.

'''GnollHack''' is a variant of [[NetHack 3.6.2]] developed by Sound Mind Games, a Finnish nonprofit organization. It adds numerous monsters and items, changes spellcasting, and adds Gnolls as a playable race (replacing Gnomes).

GnollHack has a forum [https://community.soundmindgames.com/forums/gnollhack.18/ here]. It also has an [https://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack/wiki official wiki]. [https://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack/wiki/Starting-Guide-for-NetHack-Veterans This] is a useful page for some initial pointers to the variant if you're well-versed in regular NetHack.

== Servers ==

GnollHack can be played on the following servers:

* US: ssh play@server.gnollhack.com
* EU: ssh play@eu-server.gnollhack.com
* AU: ssh play@au-server.gnollhack.com

== New objects ==

GnollHack adds the following new objects:

* bag of wizardry: Reduces the weight of spellbooks, scrolls, reagents, and wands to 1/8

== Experience formula ==

Note that the EXP gain was also changed, as described in their wiki linked below.

* You can get information about items by using #examine, or Alt+x. If the item is formally identified, it will describe its effect.
* Note that the cost for temple protection ("major contribution") changed: instead of 400*XL, it's now 2500 + 150*XL.
* Mummy rot is a fatal illness. The message when you're afflicted is "You feel severely ill." (so that's what you want to configure MSGTYPE for).
* There are no ability exercise or abuse. If you want higher attributes than you started with, you'll have to alchemize gain ability yourself. For Int/Wis, you can also use blessed enlightenment, which can be made from fountains of power.

&&%s&& %s Altar farming {149667 2023-01-06T18:34:31Z {4000867 K2} Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/MrSurvivor1997|MrSurvivor1997]] ([[User talk:MrSurvivor1997|talk]]) to last revision by [[User:Actual-nh|Actual-nh]] '''Altar farming''', sometimes referred to as '''altar scumming''' in more extreme forms, is the act of camping by an [[altar]] within the [[Mazes of Menace]] for an inordinate amount of time for the purpose of obtaining numerous [[sacrifice gift]]s and [[favor]]s. As with some other forms of [[farming]], some players may consider this to be against the spirit of the game.

==Description==
[[Monster creation]] does happen over time, but normally not fast enough for the purposes of altar farming. Players who want to try altar farming will usually need a way to spawn a large number of strong monsters very quickly. Useful tools for accomplishing this include:

* Being on a lower [[dungeon level]] or having a higher [[experience level]] (makes stronger monsters spawn)
* Using [[Wand of create monster|wands]] or [[Scroll of create monster|scrolls of create monster]], the [[spell of create monster]], or a [[bag of tricks]] to manually create monsters.
** [[Scroll of charging|Scrolls of charging]] and [[The Platinum Yendorian Express Card]] increase the uses available from the wand and bag, and [[The Eye of the Aethiopica]] allows the spell to be cast frequently
* Having a [[werecreature]] summon help or a spellcasting monster cast the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]]
* Being [[chaotic]] (allows for [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|same-race sacrifices]])

Of course, just because you can create an extremely high number of monsters [[Archon|doesn’t]] [[Ki-rin|mean]] [[Titan|you’ll]] [[Angel|live]] [[Lich#Arch-lich|to]] [[Dragon#Black_dragon|sacrifice]] [[Wand_of_death|them]] [[Touch_of_death|all]]. Other tools must also be on hand to kill them and manage all their [[Death_drop|death drops]]:

* Low [[Armor_class|AC]] to take numerous strong physical attacks
* A strong [[weapon]] to kill monsters quickly
** Sacrificing can give you an [[artifact weapon]] to use for further farming
* [[Gloves]] to handle [[Cockatrice|cockatrice corpses]]
* [[Magic resistance]] to resist the [[Destroy armor (monster spell)|destroy armor]] and [[Curse_items|curse items]] monster spells
* [[Reflection]] to resist [[Attack_wand|attack wands]] and [[Dragon|dragons’ breath]]
* [[Escape item]]s if too many monsters spawn or the ones spawned are too much to handle
* A [[container]] for storing useful death drops and keeping them out of monsters’ hands
* Means of curing [[lycanthropy]] if using werecreatures for farming
* Plenty of [[Comestible|food]] or a [[ring of slow digestion]] if you’re following a food-related [[Conduct#Vegan|conduct]]
** Food also helps save corpses for sacrificing that you’d otherwise have to eat (unless you want their [[Corpse#Gaining_intrinsics|intrinsics]])

==Sacrificing for gifts==
One of the benefits that can be gained from altar farming is [[Sacrifice#Gifts|sacrifice gifts]]; with the extremely high number of sacrifices coming in, [[Artifact_weapon|artifact weapons]] are much easier to come across, and you can get multiple in case you don’t get the one you want. Of course, the more gifts you receive, the longer it’ll take for you to get your next one. [[Grayswandir]], [[Vorpal Blade]], [[Magicbane]], [[Fire_and_Frost_Brand|Fire/Frost Brand]], and [[Stormbringer]] are all in reasonable reach with the use of altar farming.

==Sacrificing to pray==
The other benefit of altar farming is that it can very quickly get rid of your [[prayer timeout]] so you can repeatedly pray for [[Prayer#Favors_and_gifts|gifts, favors, and other boons]]. The ones that are the most worth pursuing include:

* Removing [[BUC#Cursed_items|curses]] without spending [[Potion_of_holy_water|holy water]]
* Increasing your max HP (by bringing yourself to low HP before praying)
* Gaining intrinsic [[telepathy]], [[speed]], [[stealth]] and [[Intrinsic_protection|protection]]
* Obtaining [[spellbooks]] (you’ll usually get ones in schools you’re not restricted in)

Staying at a high enough level of [[luck]] for the best outcomes usually involves carrying around a [[luckstone]], but be careful! If your luck’s too high, there’s a chance you’ll get [[crowned]] instead, greatly slowing down the rate at which you can pray. Once you're at max luck, you can avoid crowning by breaking a [[mirror]] and putting away your luckstone before praying, and by not making sacrifices once your prayer timeout has expired.  You can also prevent crowning (even with maximum luck) by ensuring that your [[alignment record]] is below 20 when you pray.  This can be checked by using a [[stethoscope]], [[wand of probing]], or [[enlightenment]] on yourself and ensuring that you are not piously aligned.

&&%s&& %s Scroll of recall {135690 2020-08-12T07:46:57Z {4000572 FIQ} make it clear from the initial heading text that a magic whistle doesn't outright replace this {{scroll|name=recall|cost=200|ink=5-9|muse=def}}

The '''scroll of recall''' is a scroll in [[FIQHack]] that can bring pets to you like a [[magic whistle]], but can work across dungeon levels.

==Generation==

It has a base price of 200zm, ink cost of 10 and appears as 3% of all scrolls.

==Effects==

Unlike a magic whistle, the scroll draws pets across dungeon levels, unless the pet is carrying the Amulet. A cursed scroll will draw hostiles on the same level to you. An uncursed scroll will draw pets on the same level to you (like a magic whistle). A blessed scroll will draw all pets in the dungeon to your current location.

If the reader is confused, the effect is reversed -- it will instead draw the reader to a hostile monster (if cursed) or a pet (if uncursed) or possibly a pet on a different level (if blessed).

폴리파일링을 할 때에는, 스택(stack)과 파일(pile)을 구분하는 것이 중요합니다.
스택이란 단일 종류로 묶여 있는 아이템으로, "4 [[blessed|축복받은]] [[scroll of blank paper|백지의 두루마리]]"와 같은 아이템이 여기에 해당합니다.
파일이란 한 [[square|칸]] 위에 있는 모든 아이템들을 의미합니다.
본 문서에서 스택과 파일은 엄밀하게 구분되어 사용될 것입니다. 

주문spell과 완드는 빔beam 타입으로 6~13 사이의 사정거리로 발사된다(일렬로 늘어진 파일 바로 옆에서 폴리모프 빔을 쏘면, 3~7개 정도의 파일에 마법을 걸 수 있을 정도) 따라서 폴리모프 1회로 다수의 파일에 마법을 걸 수 있다. 폴리모프 포션은 한번에 #dip한 하나의 스택에만 폴리모프 마법을 걸 수 있다.


폴리모프 된 아이템이라고 하더라도 본연의 클래스class는 변하지 않는다. 따라서 포션은 폴리모프 되어도 포션이고, 스크롤은 언제나 스크롤이다. 그런 이유로 유니콘 뿔unicorn horn은 폴리포더 1순위다. 유니콘 뿔의 클래스는 마법도구magic tool 이고, 매직 마커magic maker가 마법도구 클래스에 속한다. 또 다른 폴리파일링의 유용한 사용법은 게임 초반에 스펠북을 폴리모프 하는 것이다. 폴리모프 마법은 아이템의 충전횟수charge와 마법부여enchantment 수치를 바꾸지 않는다.


당연히 폴리파일링에도 문제점은 있다. 폴리모프 마법에 의해 폴리포더가 파괴되어 사라질 수 있고, 열받은 골렘golem이 만들어 질 수도 있다(더 자세한 사항은 다음 섹션을 참고하라), 아이템이 파괴되는 정확한 메커니즘은 다소 복잡하나 최대한의 이득을 얻기 위해서는 어느 정도 이해하고 있을 필요가 있다.


완드와 스펠북은 폴리모프가 되면 아이템의 퀄리티가 낮아진다. 스펠북의 경우 한 번 더 읽은 것으로 계산된다. 넷핵의 스펠북은 읽을 수 있는 횟수가 네 번으로 한정되어 있고, 모든 횟수만큼 읽는다면 글자가 희미해져 읽을 수 없는 상태가 된다. 또한 스펠북을 읽은 횟수와 폴리모프된 횟수의 합이 4 이상이고, 읽은 주문책의 마법이 이미 알고 있는 것이라면 이 경우에도 글자가 너무 희미하다는 메시지를 볼 것이다. 하지만, 주문을 모르는 상태라면 주문을 익힐 수 있지만 스펠북은 "글자가 너무 희미한" 상태가 되어 다음엔 읽을 수 없다. 스펠북을 완전히 다 읽은 상태가 되면 used blank spellbook이 된다. 이 상태는 unused blank spellbook와는 구별되는 상태다. 매직 마커로 새로운 스펠북을 쓰는 것만이 used blank spellbook을 다시 사용할 수 있는 유일한 방법이다.


비슷하게 완드를 폴리모프하는 것도 재충전recharge한 것으로 계산된다. 완드의 재충전 횟수는 다음 재충전 때 완드가 폭발할 확률을 높이는 효과가 있다. 따라서 다 쓴 완드를 폴리파일링에 쓰는 것은 설사 좋은 완드를 얻을지라도 그렇게 큰 이득은 아니다, 이미 그 완드의 폭발 확률이 일반 완드보다 높아졌기 때문이다. 폴리모프에 의해 재충전 횟수가 증가할 확률은 max(0,(6-x)/7) 로 계산되며, x는 이전에 재충전된 횟수를 의미한다.


이와 반대로 도구tools의 재충전 횟수는 폴리모프에 영향 받지 않는다(매직 마커는 예외적으로 한번 재충전 한 것으로 세팅 됨)


상점의 아이템을 폴리파일링하는 것은 상점 주인을 열받게 만든다.


크로커다일 시체crocodile corpse를 폴리파일링하면 a pair of non-cursed fireproof +0 low boots 를 얻을 수 있다.

The spell and wand supply a beam with a random range between 6 and 13 (long enough to hit 3 to 7 piles if they are all in line and contiguous and you are adjacent to the first) so you can work on several piles at once. A [[potion of polymorph]] works on one item stack at a time, the item stack you dip into it.

Polymorphed items do not change item class. Potions will always yield potions, scrolls will yield scrolls, etc. [[Unicorn horn]]s are especially popular polyfodder because they may polymorph into other [[magical tool]]s, such as [[magic marker]]s. Another useful thing to do if you gain polymorph in the early game is to polypile [[spellbook]]s. Polymorphing retains the [[charge]]s and [[enchantment]] of polymorphed items.

Polypiling has its drawbacks. Polyfodder may be destroyed, and hostile [[golem]]s may be generated. See [[#Probability of item loss and golem generation for wand and spell|the next section]] for more details. The exact mechanics of item destruction are rather complex, but understanding them is important if you want to get the most out of your resources.

When polymorphing [[wand]]s and spellbooks, their quality degrades. A spellbook will act as if it had been [[read]] once more. If the book's combined read/polymorph-count is four or more, it will turn into a blank spellbook counted as read 0&ndash;3 times;{{refsrc|zap.c|1552|nethack=3.6.1}} it will thus subsequently be able to be polymorphed into a non-blank spellbook with 75% chance.

Likewise, a wand may count as if it had been [[charging#wands|recharged]], increasing the chance of an explosion if you attempt to recharge it; thus, it is not generally worthwhile to polypile empty wands, even if they become something worth charging, the chances of the new wand exploding instead of [[charging]] are already higher than normal. The chance of a wand's charge counter being incremented by polymorphing it is {{sfrac|6 &minus; <var>x</var>|7}} where <var>x</var> is the number of times the wand has been recharged.{{refsrc|zap.c|1333|comment=recharge count < rn2(7)  to see if polymorph increments charge counter on wands}}
