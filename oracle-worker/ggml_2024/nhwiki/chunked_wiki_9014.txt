'''Ring mail''' is a type of [[body armor]] that grants a base [[AC]] bonus of 3 and [[magic cancellation]] 1.

==Generation==
[[Knight]]s enter the dungeon with a +1 ring mail.  [[Human (starting race)|Human]] [[Barbarian]]s start with a +0 one.

==History==
Ring mail became [[MC]]1 in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].  In variants (such as [[SLASH'EM]]) based on older versions, it may have an MC of 0.

==Strategy==

The [[studded leather armor]] is generally preferred because it is [[weight|lighter]], less expensive, and does not interfere with [[spellcasting]].

{{clear}}
==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Ring armour}}
Ring mail is a standard type of armor in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and games and media inspired by it, but it is unclear if it ever existed as portrayed in D&D.  There is no record of the term being used before the 19th century, when it was described to describe an armor composed of metal rings, not interlinked as in true mail ([[chain mail]] in D&D and NetHack), but stitched to a leather or cloth base.  In this respect it might be considered a more involved form of [[studded leather armor]].

There are no known examples of authentic ring mail, only speculative interpretations of medieval artwork and historical accounts.

'''Chain mail''' is a type of [[body armor]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is made of [[iron]], and provides [[magic cancellation|MC1]] and 5 base [[AC]] when worn.

==Generation==
[[Player monster]] [[Barbarian (player monster)|Barbarians]], [[Knight (player monster)|Knights]], [[Priest (player monster)|Priests]], and [[Valkyrie (player monster)|Valkyries]] have a {{frac|2}} chance to force a random suit of body armor instead of [[dragon scale mail]], and a {{frac|8}} chance for that body armor to be chain mail - effectively a {{frac|7|128}} or ~5.47% chance to be [[Monster starting inventory|generated with one]].{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|175|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|202|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|216|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|243|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Chain mail is a decent set of armor, but additionally blocks [[spellcasting]] and is heavy as well. Roles looking to shore up their AC early can make good use of a set of chain mail until they find options that are lighter (e.g., [[mithril-coat|mithril-coats]]) and/or more conducive to spell casting (e.g., [[studded leather armor]] or [[dragon scale mail]]).

==History==
Chain mail has been present in the game since ''Hack 1.21'', one of the first variants of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Mail (armour)}}
Chain mail is made of small metal rings interlocked to form a mesh, and was widely used in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, from pre-Roman times until as late as the 19th century. In medieval sources, this type of armor was described simply as "mail" - the use of the term to describe other types of armor (and the invention of "chain mail" to distinguish it from those ) began in 19th-century historical fiction.

The stats for chain mail are derived from its appearance in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the [[Undead Slayer]] has a {{frac|4}} chance to start with chain mail as their body armor. A chain mail can also be found in the lawful [[temple]] within the goal level of the [[Yeoman quest]].

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], [[Croesus]] has a {{frac|7|8}} chance to generate wearing [[Gold (material)|gold]] chain mail.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarven]] [[Binder (dNetHack role)|Binders]] always start with a [[rust|thoroughly rusty]] chain mail. Dwarven and female [[Half-dragon (starting race)|half-dragon]] [[Noble]]s will always start with standard chain mail, as do all non-[[Incantifier (dNetHack starting race)|Incantifier]] Knights.

Any [[Orc (starting race)|orcish]] player that would start with chain mail receives [[orcish chain mail]] instead.

The '''bat''' is a class of [[NetHack]] [[monster]] represented by the overall symbol {{white|B}}.  They are all extremely fast and can fly, as one would expect.

The '''bat''', {{monsym|bat}}, is also the weakest monster of this class.  Other bats include the {{monsymlink|giant bat}} and the {{monsymlink|vampire bat}}. The {{monsymlink|raven}}, a [[bird]], also uses the same symbol.

Eating a bat corpse is a bad idea.  It [[stun]]s you for 30 turns{{refsrc|eat.c|846}}, and the corpse itself is worth only 20 [[nutrition]].  [[Pet]]s, however, are for some reason immune to stunning, and can easily eat bat corpses.

Bats [[growing up|grow up]] to be giant bats.

[[Player]]s polymorphed into bats are permanently [[stun]]ned.{{refsrc|youprop.h|89}}

== Movement ==
All {{white|B}} monsters have slightly erratic movement. If the monster decides to move, there is a 1 in 3 chance that the monster will fly in a random direction, rather than approach you.{{refsrc|monmove.c|728}} If you are fleeing from a bat, this might provide a moment of relief. If you stay in melee range, the monster will also stay in melee range and continue to attack you.

Interestingly, any bat, giant bat or vampire bat generated in Gehennom is made slightly faster than normal.{{refsrc|makemon.c|993}} Presumably because nothing moves like a "bat [on its way] out of hell".

== Strategy ==
Bats and [[giant bat]]s both appear early in the game, and the giant bats are individually more dangerous. Bats normally appear in small groups.

The bats of NetHack stay within melee range, making them easy targets for many players.

When eaten, bat and [[giant bat]] corpses cause the player to be stunned (for 30 and 60 turns, respectively). [[Vampire bat]] corpses are poisonous, while [[raven]]s are safe to eat.

==History==
Bats have annoyed adventurers seeking the [[Amulet of Yendor]] since the days of [[Hack]], back when eating a dead bat would cause [[confusion]] because [[stun]] was not yet implemented.

==Biodiversity patch==
Real life bats have [[echolocation]], employing sound to discover the positions of things in the dark. NetHack does not implement echolocation, though the [[biodiversity patch]] does, at least if you polymorph into a bat.

The '''vampire bat''', {{monsym|vampire_bat}}, is a [[monster]] in [[NetHack]]. It is the most powerful variety of [[bat]]. Despite its name, it cannot [[drain life]] the way a [[vampire]] can, but it does have a [[poison]]ous bite.

Its corpse is poisonous, but unlike the corpses of other species of bat, it does not stun the player.

As of version 3.6.0, a vampire bat may actually be a shapeshifted [[vampire]] or [[vampire lord]], and resurrect in that form after being killed.

==Player==

[[Player]]s [[polymorph]]ed into vampire bats
* are permanently [[stun]]ned.
* will polymorph into [[vampire]]s when the player polymorphs without [[polymorph control]].

==Identifying polymorphed vampires==

A vampire bat can be identified as a polymorphed vampire by using any means of probing ([[wand of probing]], [[stethoscope]], attack with [[Magicbane]]); the message will show a "shapeshifter." Attacking a vampire bat with a [[silver]] weapon will sear it if it is really a vampire.

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], vampire bats are classified as members of the vampire [[race]].  This does not give them any actual vampiric properties, but [[vampire (starting race in SLASH'EM)|player vampires]] can nevertheless use their corpses for [[sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|same-race sacrifice]].

==Biology==

Vampire bats are real, and common to the American Southwest as well as Central and South America. There are three distinct species of vampire bat, and are the only animals known to feed primarily or solely on the blood of other animals.

}}

The '''stalker''', {{monsym|stalker}}, is an [[elemental]] [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. As it is always generated [[invisible]], the game frequently refers to them as '''invisible stalkers'''.

Eating stalker meat will [[stun]] the player and turn them temporarily invisible for 50-149 turns if they are not already invisible; if eaten while already invisible, the player will become permanently invisible and gain the [[see invisible]] intrinsic.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|996|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Wearing a [[mummy wrapping]] counts as being visible for this purpose.

[[Player]]s that [[polymorph]] into stalkers are stunned as long as they maintain the polyform.

==Generation==
Stalkers are always generated invisible as indicated above, and will always be hostile.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1251|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} 

The stalker is the second [[quest monster]] for [[Samurai]], and makes up 14% of the monsters randomly generated in the [[Samurai quest]]. Stalkers are also generated upon the initial creation of each quest level: one each on the home and upper filler levels, nine in the locate level, three in the lower filler level(s), and nine at the goal level. Stalkers are also part of the first quest [[monster class]] for [[Monk]]s and the second quest class for Samurai.

Stalkers may be created by a hostile [[spellcaster]] casting the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]]. 

==Strategy==
Stalkers can hit fairly hard with their single attack and move at the same speed as an unburdened, unhasted player - in addition to being invisible, their "stunned" effect causes them to move erratically, making them annoying to face or avoid unless you have a means of detecting them (e.g., see invisible or [[telepathy]]).

Stalker meat is one of the more reliable sources of the see invisible intrinsic, either through eating two separate servings in quick succession or else eating one with a worn source of invisibility. As eating stalkers stuns you, be sure to avoid doing so in the midst of battle unless you can cure it quickly (e.g., with a [[unicorn horn]]); keeping a [[mummy wrapping]] around is also advisable if you plan on shopping at any point afterward.

==History==
The stalker has been present in the game since [[PDP-11 Hack]], a variant of Jay Fenlason's Hack. From this version and the first releases of [[Hack 1.0]] until [[NetHack 3.3.0]], the symbol {{white|I}} was used to represent the stalker (I meaning "invisible"). Starting with [[3.3.1]], the stalker was moved to the {{monclasssym|E}} class, and {{white|I}} instead indicates the last known position of ''any'' invisible monster.

==Origin==
The invisible stalker is a monster that appears in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where it is a type of [[air elemental]]; this is likely the basis for making the stalker part of the elemental monster class, and may explain their ability of [[flight]]. As most versions of ''Hack'' and ''NetHack'' automatically prefix monster names with "invisible" when relaying actions referring to an invisible monster, the word "invisible" is dropped from the monster's name to avoid the redundant "invisible invisible stalker".

==Messages==
{{message|You feel hidden!|You permanently gained the invisibility intrinsic by eating a stalker corpse while already temporarily invisible.  Eating a stalker corpse while invisible (temporarily or permanently) will also give the see invisible intrinsic, but no message is given.}}

==Variants==
===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], stalkers that leave corpses will always leave [[Invisible item (SLASH'EM)|invisible ones]].

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], stalkers also leave corpses that are always invisible upon death, and the Cloud Bank of the [[Lawful Quest]] will always contain at least one stalker. This also applies to [[SlashTHEM]].

&&%s&& %s Invisibility {140897 2021-06-14T05:17:40Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Sources */ Repair link '''Invisibility''' is a [[property]] that prevents [[you]] from being seen by monsters that lack the [[see invisible]] property. Monsters with the invisibility property cannot be seen normally by a player without see invisible, though invisible monsters can be detected through other methods.

==Effects==
While invisible, the monster's glyph cannot be seen on the map unless the monster can be seen through another method, such as [[telepathy]]. If you bump into an invisible monster, their square will be marked with an {{white|I}}, and [[searching]] will also mark their locations this way; however, this is done before the monster takes action, meaning they will often move to another square afterward. Bumping into a [[peaceful]] invisible monster will anger it.

While you are invisible, monsters will have difficulty locating you, and attacking monsters take a -2 to-hit penalty; such monsters will attack the square they think you are located on. Invisibility has no effect on combat between monsters.

An invisible player will be prevented from entering [[shop]]s by the [[shopkeeper]]. ("Invisible customers are not welcome!") The shopkeeper will also prevent invisible players from leaving.

===Effects on other objects and properties===
Invisibility prevents [[displacement]] from working on monsters that do not see invisible. You also cannot scare monsters by [[apply]]ing a [[mirror]] unless they can see invisible; similarly, mirrors and sources of [[reflection]] will not reflect [[Medusa]]'s petrifying [[gaze]] while you are invisible.

While invisible, wearing a [[mummy wrapping]] will render you visible until it is taken off.

==Sources==
There are multiple methods of becoming invisible:

* You can become invisible by [[quaff]]ing a [[potion of invisibility]], zapping a [[wand of make invisible]] at yourself, or wearing a [[cloak of invisibility]]; monsters can also do the same, and the potion effect is always permanent for monsters. You can also wear ([[Eating jewelry|or eat]]) a [[ring of invisibility]], which will [[auto-identify]] itself when you put it on unless you have invisibility from another source. Except for non-[[blessed]] potions, these items will make you invisible either permanently or until you remove them.

* The {{spellbook of|invisibility}} spell and non-blessed potions of invisibility will grant you temporary invisibility for 31-45 (more) turns.

* The [[Orb of Detection]], the [[Archeologist]] [[quest artifact]], can be #[[invoked]] to toggle invisibility on or off if you do not already have the property.

* Eating [[stalker]] meat will stun you and turn you invisible for 50-149 (more) turns; if you are already invisible through other means, you will instead gain permanent invisibility and the see invisible intrinsic. Pets cannot gain invisibility from eating stalkers.

Monsters will make use of the wand and the potion, which is always permanent for them, and the [[disappear]] [[monster spell|monster mage spell]] renders its caster invisible. Tame and peaceful monsters will only use these if you can ''currently'' [[see invisible]]. Stalkers and [[black light]]s are always generated invisible.

==Strategy==
Invisibility has a number of perks for especially crafty players. Pets gain no benefits from being invisible, as it does not affect monster-versus-monster combat, and will only make them harder to keep track of.

Tame and peaceful monsters that have a way to turn invisible, including spellcasters, only do so if you have see invisible; this is particularly dangerous if you got the property from drinking a non-blessed [[potion of see invisible]], as you will not be able to see them once it expires. Bumping into invisible monsters will anger them - this is potentially fatal in the case of the [[watch]] and shopkeepers.

===Fighting while invisible===
Invisibility is a good evasive aid, usually resulting in hostile attackers missing more often unless you stay in one place; it is especially useful in the early game, where few monsters will have see invisible, and can aid in escape from unexpectedly powerful foes. This can also double as an offensive aid that helps you keep targets off-balance while picking them off from a distance, e.g., with [[projectile]]s or [[polearms]]. As the game progresses, you will encounter more monsters with see invisible, limiting its effectiveness (unless paired with something like displacement).

Since its passive gaze relies on ''you'' seeing it, a [[floating eye]] is not affected by a player's invisibility; however, turning the eye invisible instead will render the gaze ineffective (unless you have see invisible), rendering it harmless and allowing you to attack it with impunity. Invisible floating eyes will also not paralyze pets that cannot see invisible; this is especially useful for [[pacifist]]s.

Invisibility can actually be a disadvantage in certain scenarios: [[unicorn]]s in particular cannot see invisible and will not know the player's location to keep a knight's jump away, meaning that hostile unicorns will close in unexpectedly and likely skewer an early character. Conversely, invisible players can safely approach co-aligned unicorns to throw their [[gems]] at, and cross-aligned ones will be easier to kill or pacify for a prepared character. Invisibility can also make controlling other monsters for various purposes difficult if they lack see invisible, e.g., luring [[soldier]]s into [[Castle]] [[trap door]]s or luring [[wraith]]s away from non-[[graveyard]] levels. 

The mummy wrapping is a good cloak for players who elects to remain invisible long-term, but find it necessary to become temporarily visible for certain tasks. Like any other piece of armor, be sure to verify the [[beatitude]] of a wrapping before trying it on. If you temporarily remove another cloak to use a wrapping, make sure to replace the cloak once you're done.

===Fighting invisible monsters===
Invisible monsters can be annoying to deal with, and are especially aggravating if the base monster was already decently strong (e.g., a stalker). Searching can reveal their approximate location and help you take the fight to them, and you can also lure the monster down a narrow hallway to make it easier to target; monsters that drink cursed potions of invisibility will also "aggravate" you, revealing their location to you temporarily and allowing you to plan accordingly.

Pets are not deterred by invisibility and can pick a monster off as it approaches; if the monster is a black light, however, it will likely explode and [[confuse]] them, causing them to potentially attack you in turn. [[Shapeshifter]]s that turn into powerful enough spellcasting monsters can cast disappear, and will retain their invisibility even after they shift forms again.

Monsters can generate with a wand of make invisible as a [[miscellaneous item]]; if you recently heard a zap prior to killing an invisible monster, and the monster drops a wand that makes engravings vanish, it is most likely a wand of make invisible.

===Invisibility and shops===
One of the main disadvantages to invisibility is the hassle of shopping - you will be barred from entering or leaving unless you make yourself visible, which is especially troublesome if the source is a cursed item or gave invisibility that was permanent. Most players should keep a mummy wrapping or two on hand in case they accidentally wear such a cursed item and cannot remove it, obtain invisibility that cannot be toggled, or else simply plan to shop while invisible; they can also try to [[teleport]] into and out of the shop.

==Variants==

In [[SLASH'EM]]
====Invisible items====
{{main|Invisible item (SLASH'EM)}}
Items can also be invisible as well - this includes the [[corpse]]s of killed invisible monsters, but not any [[statue]]s created from [[stoning]] them. Zapping an item(s) with a wand of make invisible will turn it invisible, as will dipping them in a potion of invisibility; dipping the item in a potion of see invisible or [[cancelling]] it will render it visible again. There is a {{frac|1250}} chance that a randomly generated item will be created invisible.<ref>{{sourcecode|mkobj.c|683|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>

The [[wand of wishing]] in the Castle is always invisible, but will always be found within its [[chest]] under normal circumstances. Mummy wrappings and [[zorkmids]] can never be made invisible, and Sokoban [[boulder]]s cannot generate invisible.<ref>{{sourcecode|obj.h|145|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>

Invisible items mostly function the same as their visible counterparts, with some exceptions:

* An invisible [[blindfold]] or [[towel]] will still blind you if worn.
* An invisible mirror will not function when applied unless the monster has see invisible.
* Invisible scrolls and books cannot be [[read]] if you cannot see invisible. <!-- The same constraint doesn't appear to exist for monsters, but it doesn't make a big difference as they can't pick up invisible scrolls, only be generated with them -->
* An invisible weapon has a +3 to-hit bonus against monsters that cannot see invisible.
* Invisible items cannot be stolen by a monster that cannot see invisible, with the exception of invisible body armor or a cloak worn on top of a visible [[t-shirt]] or body armor; no monster with a theft attack can normally see invisible.<ref>{{sourcecode|steal.c|277|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>
* The [[disarm (technique)|disarm technique]] cannot be used if you cannot see the target's weapon.

Monsters will not pick up invisible objects if they cannot see invisible;<ref>{{sourcecode|mon.c|1025|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref> however, this does not prevent them from moving to the item, with the result that they stand on top of it trying and failing to pick it up repeatedly.

&&%s&& %s See invisible {148198 2022-09-20T20:41:35Z {4001042 Bleem} /* Monsters with intrinsic see invisible */ not sure why half of these names were capitalized '''See invisible''' is an [[intrinsic]] which enables you to spot [[invisibility|invisible]] monsters and [[you]]rself, if you are invisible. It is very useful to possess as high level spellcasting monsters can render themselves invisible, and some monsters (notably [[stalker]]s) are intrinsically invisible.

Invisible monsters can also be seen with telepathy, barring the possibility of a mindless creature getting zapped with a [[Wands|wand of invisibility]]

The ability to see invisible can be acquired in the following ways:
* Drink a [[potion of see invisible]] (if non-blessed, will be temporary).
* Eat a stalker while invisible (note that this also gives permanent invisibility).
* Be [[crowning|crowned]] by your god.
* Sit on a [[throne]] (a small chance).
* Drink from a [[fountain]] (a small chance, and can also have bad effects).
* Wear a [[ring of see invisible]].
* Be a [[Monk]] or a 15th-level [[Ranger]].
* Polymorph into a monster with intrinsic see invisible.

One possible negative side-effect of only seeing invisible temporarily is that peaceful monsters might make themselves invisible (since you can then still see them), but once you can't see them anymore (e.g., by removing the [[ring of see invisible]]), they stay invisible. Running into them will then anger them, which might end in a quick death.

==SLASH'EM==
See invisible is especially important in SLASH'EM. [[Pixie]]s are the (even more) annoying equivalent of nymphs, because they are always invisible. Therefore they can strip you naked, without you having a chance to fight back.

Invisible items are exceedingly rare, but importantly, even invisible non-artifact weapons are good, since [[invisible item (SLASH'EM)|they]] give +3 to-hit versus monsters which cannot see invisible. Finally, imagine the (exceedingly unlikely) annoyance if you skip a randomly generated [[Grayswandir]] on Dlvl 1 because you couldn't see it.

&&%s&& %s Wresting {143597 2021-11-08T00:18:22Z {723 Scorchgeek} /* Strategy */ note danger of accidental wrests When zapping or engraving with a wand that has no charges remaining, there is a 1 in 121 chance{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2137|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} that you will '''wrest''' another charge out of the wand, providing you with one last bit of magic after which the wand crumbles to dust. It is most commonly cited in connection with [[wand of wishing|wands of wishing]], where one last [[wish]] can be immensely useful; it is nevertheless possible with any wand.

A [[Cancellation|cancelled]] wand cannot be wrested from, as the internal charge counter is set to -1 by the act of cancellation.

==Messages==

{{message|You wrest one last charge from the worn-out wand.|You were successful in wresting the final charge.}}
{{message|The &lt;wand&gt; turns to dust.|The wrested wand is destroyed, after the charge is wrested.}}
{{message|The &lt;wand&gt; glows violently, then turns to dust.  You are not going to get anywhere trying to write in the <nowiki>[dust|frost]</nowiki> with your dust.|You wrested the final charge whilst engraving. The wand crumbles to dust before you can engrave anything.}}

==Strategy==

The usual technique associated with wresting is to #[[adjust]] the wand to the [[z]] inventory slot and holding down the {{kbd|z}} key to zap the wand repeatedly, greatly reducing the amount of real time and effort needed to extract the wrested charge. Be sure to pay attention to what's going on around you while you hold down the key, or you may end up dead without knowing what killed you. Ideally you'd quickly tap the {{kbd|z}} key instead of holding it.

Tapping {{kbd|ctrl|a}} (redo command) is an alternative to tapping {{kbd|z}}.

84 zaps are needed for a 50% chance of success.

It's not possible to use the wrested charge from a [[wand of fire]], [[wand of lightning|lightning]], or [[wand of digging|digging]] to engrave with.

If you have the resources, it's a good idea to formally [[Identification|identify]] extremely valuable wands that you plan to recharge (e.g., [[Wand of wishing|wands of wishing]]) before zapping them enough times that they could potentially have reached 0 charges; while the 1/121 chance of discovering the wand is empty by accidentally wresting it is small, if you play enough games this ''will'' happen eventually!

==History==

Prior to [[NetHack 3.6.0|3.6.0]], a useful alternative for non-directional wands such as wishing was to engrave with them while levitating, or to abort when prompted what text to engrave. Unsuccessful and canceled attempts to write did not consume a game turn, but did attempt to use the wand. This was [[bug#C343-246|bug C343-246]]. When levitating, [[adjust]]ing the wand to {{kbd|E}} and holding down that key you will get your wrest very quickly. This is safe because the "You wrest one last charge from the worn-out wand." message triggers a more prompt. This made exploiting the bug much faster with levitation.

&&%s&& %s Cold {137668 2021-02-09T23:15:13Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* References */ In addition to harming the player and monsters, '''cold''' in NetHack can shatter [[potions]], freeze [[water]]y terrain, and harden [[lava]].

Cold damage comes from the following sources:

* Zapped or broken [[wand of cold]]
* Blown [[frost horn]]
* [[spellbook of cone of cold|Spell of cone of cold]]
* Cold [[breath]] of a [[winter wolf]] ([[winter wolf cub|cub]]), [[white dragon]], or [[silver dragon]]
* [[Melee]] attack of an [[ice troll]], [[ice devil]], or [[lich]] (any type)
* [[Passive attack]] of a [[brown mold]] or [[blue jelly]]
* [[Engulf]]ing attack of an [[ice vortex]]
* [[Explosion attack]] of a [[freezing sphere]]
* Bonus damage of the [[artifact]] [[Frost Brand]]


==Effects==
All potions on the floor or in your main inventory can be destroyed by cold, by freezing and shattering.  Potions in [[container]]s are safe.

Cold rays and explosions may freeze [[water]], turning it into [[ice]].  In [[NetHack 3.6.0]] ice formed this way is likely to be temporary, melting back to water after 50-2000 turns{{refsrc|src/zap.c|4105|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}, so be careful when standing on it!  Water on the [[Plane of Water]] will never turn to ice ("The water freezes for a moment.")  The same attacks can also cause lava to cool and solidify into an ordinary stone [[floor]].  Hardened lava will not thaw out again, at least not in the present version.

===Passive cold attacks===
The cold-based [[passive attack]]s of brown molds and blue jellies are noteworthy: if they do damage to the target, they heal the mold or jelly and can even cause it to multiply!  

Each attack that does damage adds half the number of points of damage to the monster's hit points.  If the new hit point total exceeds the monster's current maximum, the maximum increases. If the monster gains enough hit points from this it will [[division|divide]] into two monsters of the same type. 

Thankfully, [[cold resistance]], which prevents damage from this attack, keeps such monsters from multiplying at your expense.

==Cold protection==
Damage to yourself or your inventory can be prevented or minimized by the following:

* '''Resistance''': Intrinsic or extrinsic [[cold resistance]] prevents or reduces hit point loss from cold attacks.  It does not prevent destruction of potions in your main inventory.
* '''Reflection''': Cold [[ray]]s and [[breath]] attacks can be [[Reflection|reflect]]ed, preventing damage to yourself and your items. Nondirectional attacks (melee, passive attacks, explosions) cannot.
* '''Containers''':  Items in [[container]]s are safe from fire damage.
* '''Magic cancellation''': High MC can protect your inventory from melee cold attacks. It does not prevent damage from passive or engulfing cold attacks, or from explosions or ray attacks.

==SLASH'EM==
* [[SLASH'EM]] features the new [[role]] of [[Ice Mage]] and the artifact [[athame]] named [[Deep Freeze]], which deals cold damage.
* The following new SLASH'EM [[monster (SLASH'EM)|monsters]] have cold attacks: [[snow ant]]s, [[shadow wolf|shadow wolves]], [[mist wolf|mist wolves]], [[steel golem]]s, [[crystal golem]]s, [[shadow]]s, and [[Vecna]].
* When entering the [[Chaotic Quest]], you will get the message, "You feel deathly cold."  This coldness does not harm [[you]] or damage anything in your inventory.

==UnNetHack==
* [[UnNetHack]] adds a [[cold trap]], found in [[Sheol]], which deals cold damage in a manner similar to a [[fire trap]].

[[Gremlin]]s, [[Mold|brown molds]], and [[blue jelly|blue jellies]] can divide into two with half the HP and maximum HP of the original - the former from any source of water and the latter two from inflicting damage with their [[passive attack|passive]] [[cold]] attacks.

[[Brown pudding|Brown]] and [[black pudding]]s will divide into two with half the current HP but the same maximum HP as the original monster when hit with any [[iron]] item.  As the maximum HP does not decrease, it is possible to split these monsters indefinitely if they are [[healing|healed]] after splitting, giving rise to the practice of [[pudding farming]]. (As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], puddings and molds no longer leave corpses, making farming inviable.)

[[Long worm]]s can have part of their [[long worm tail|tail]] cut off, sometimes resulting in a new worm as the old tail; the maximum HPs of the two resulting worms depends on their length.

The [[Wizard of Yendor]] can cast [[Double Trouble]], creating a copy of himself at full HP, provided no copy already exists.

The '''djinni''', {{monsym|djinni}} (plural '''''djinn'''''), is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

Despite sharing a glyph with [[major demon]]s, the djinn do not share any of their characteristics. Djinn are [[poison resistance|poison resistant]] and immune to [[stoning]]; despite being poisonous to eat, this almost never comes up, as they do not leave corpses.

==Generation==
Djinn are only generated on the [[Plane of Air]], where three are guaranteed; additional djinn can be generated elsewhere by rubbing a [[magic lamp]] or drinking a [[smoky potion]]. A djinni generated this way might be [[tame]], peaceful, or hostile - in some cases it might simply disappear, sometimes granting a [[wish]] first. A tame djinni makes a powerful [[pet]] in the early game&mdash;it is intelligent and will use weapons&mdash;but a wish is almost always more useful. [[Blessing]] the lamp or potion will increase the odds of receiving a wish.

A player or monster may not polymorph into a djinni.

==Strategy==
{{Main|Magic lamp|smoky potion}}

Early-game characters will want to be especially sure that any magic lamps they find are blessed, in order to minimize the chance of spawning a hostile djinni and subsequently dying. A particularly paranoid player may also want to save potential wishes from lamps or potions until they have sufficient armor or weapons to handle such a worst-case scenario; the djinn only has one attack, but can hit for up to 16 base damage.

==Messages==
The following messages can occur when you release a djinni from a magic lamp, or one is released from a smoky potion.

{{message|"I am in your debt. I will grant one wish!"|You get a wish, then the released djinni will vanish.}}
{{message|"Thank you for freeing me!"|The released djinni is [[tame]].}}
{{message|"You freed me!"|The released djinni is peaceful.}}
{{message|"It is about time!"|The released djinni simply vanishes.}}
{{message|"You disturbed me, fool!"|The released djinni is hostile (or sometimes peaceful to a neutral hero, perhaps due to a bug).}}
{{message|"Sorry, I'm all out of wishes."|You have [[chat]]ted to a tame djinni.}}
{{message|"I'm free!"|You chatted to a peaceful djinni.}}
{{message|"This will teach you not to disturb me!"|You chatted to a hostile djinni.}}

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air.  There,
among their kind, they have their own societies.  They are
sometimes encountered on earth and may even be summoned here
to perform some service for powerful wizards.  The wizards
often leave them about for later service, safely tucked away
in a flask or lamp.  Once in a while, such a tool is found by
a lucky rogue, and some djinn are known to be so grateful
when released that they might grant their rescuer a wish.

==Variants==
{{wikipedia|Genie (Dungeons & Dragons)}}
[[NetHack--]] and [[SLASH 6]] (precursors of SLASH'EM) and [[SlashTHEM]] add three more types of genie, all from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'':

* The '''efreeti''' ({{red|&}}), from the [[Plane of Fire]]
* The '''dao''' ({{gray|&}} in [[NetHack-- 3.1.3]], {{brown|&}} in SLASH 6), from the [[Plane of Earth]]
* The '''marid''' ({{cyan|&}} in NetHack-- 3.1.3, {{blue|&}} in SLASH 6), from the [[Plane of Water]]

Of note is that the efreeti and marid are referenced in regular ''NetHack'' as [[hallucinatory monster]]s.

None of the genies are randomly generated. In SLASH 6, any one of the four types can be found in a potion or magic lamp, with the same probabilities of granting wishes, etc. as a djinni in regular NetHack. (The code for randomly selecting one of the four types is present in the SlashTHEM source as well, but commented out.) Despite the elemental affinities of the three new genies, according to the ''D&D'' source, djinn remain the only species that are guaranteed to appear on any of the [[Elemental Planes]]. (In [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], only the djinni can be found in a potion or lamp, and the Elemental Planes do not exist, so it is unclear how a player can find the other three types, apart from wishing for a [[figurine]] or a [[statue]].)

Like the djinni, these genies are not considered [[demon]]s and so are not harmed by [[silver]]. They are almost identical to the djinni, except in their names, glyphs, and alleged homes. The only significant differences are that in SLASH 6 the efreeti resists [[fire]] and [[Shock|electrical]] damage (only fire in NetHack-- 3.0.10) and the marid resists [[cold]] damage. In NetHack-- 3.0.10 the dao [[phase]]s like an [[earth elemental]] while the other three genies can [[fly]]; in SLASH 6 all four are flyers. All four genies have the same [[D notation|2d8]] physical attack.

&&%s&& %s Psi bolt {99066 2015-12-20T19:38:07Z {4000080 ChasonBot}  '''Psi bolt''' is the internal name for a [[monster spell]] (though it is never referred to in the game as such). This spell can be cast by any monster that uses mage spells. 

==Damage==
This spell will deal (monster's level/2)d6 damage, plus additional damage based on the monster that cast the spell: +8d6 for [[Orcus]] and [[Demogorgon]], +6d6 for [[Dispater]], +4d6 for [[Archon]]s and [[golden naga]], +2d6 for [[ki-rin]] and +1d6 for other monsters. [[Neferet the Green]] is an exception: her Psi bolt spell does (her level/2 + 2)d8 damage.  {{refsrc|mcastu.c|261}}

The damage can be halved by [[half spell damage]] and by [[magic resistance]]; if you have both, you will only suffer one quarter of the damage (rounded up). 

==Frequency==
Because of the way monsters select their spells, the relative frequency of this spell decreases as the monster's level increases from 1 to 23, but the relative frequency increases as the monster's level increases from 23 to 50.{{refsrc|mcastu.c|83}} Thus, spellcasting monsters with a very high level (such as Demogorgon) will use this spell very often, which can be dangerous to the hero, as they can do a lot of damage with this spell (for example, 33d6 base damage for Demogorgon).

In SLASH'EM, there are many new spellcasting monsters. For the ones that can cast mage spells, the additional damages values (as explained above) are the following: +6d6 for [[ghoul mage]]s, +5d6 for [[Solar]]s, +4d6 for [[Planetar]]s and [[ghoul queen]]s, +2d6 for [[vampire mage]]s, and +1d6 for all others.

&&%s&& %s Monster spell {146829 2022-07-21T10:20:55Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Variants */ A '''monster spell''' is a category of [[spell]]s that only spell-casting [[monster]]s can make use of. Some are unique to this category, while others share properties with other magical items.

Monsters can only cast spells if they are not [[cancelled]] and at least level one, and can only cast once every (10 &minus; (monster's level)) turns to a minimum of two turns;{{refsrc|mcastu.c|214}} they will attempt to cast spells if these conditions are not met, producing a "curse" message.{{refsrc|mcastu.c|208}} Even with these conditions satisfied, there is a 2 in (monster's level) chance of the spell failing (with five times that chance if the monster is [[confusion|confused]]).{{refsrc|mcastu.c|232}}

Monsters that are scared (e.g., by [[Elbereth]]) or are not adjacent to you{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|772|nethack=3.6.1|comment=if monster is at range, buzzmu() is chosen which only handles ray-type spells}} will not use directed spells.  If a monster uses a directed spell at you, but you are on a different square than the monster expected, the spell will fail and produce a "curse" message.

Monsters will never cast spells (even not directed at you) if they're more than 7 [[square]]s away from you.{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|570|nethack=3.6.1}}

==Messages==

==Spells==
There are three categories of spells that monsters can cast: ray-type spells, mage spells, and clerical spells. In vanilla, no creature casts spells in more than one category. In the tables below, ''Min. level'' refers to the minimum level required for the monster to be able to cast that spell. The monsters that use the type of spells in each table are listed in the two ''Monsters'' column. In the ''Monsters (at lowest level)'' column, we assume that the monster is generated at its base level minus one, which is the lowest possible level at which a monster will be randomly generated. In the ''Monsters (at highest level)'' column, we assume that the monster is generated at its base level times 1.5, which is the highest possible level at which a monster will be randomly generated. In both cases, each monster can cast the spell on the line it appears, as well as every spell above it. It is still theoretically possible for monsters to cast spells that appear below their names in the table, if they drink enough potions of gain level.
The spell [[Double Trouble]] can only be used by the [[Wizard of Yendor]].
As an example, a golden naga is guaranteed to be able to cast Psi bolt, Cure self, Haste self, Stun, Disappear, Drain strength and Destroy armor. It may be able to cast Curse items and Aggravate, if it is generated at a high enough level.  

Monster spellcasting abilities are dependent on their current level, not their original level, so [[drain life|draining]] a monster will remove its ability to cast higher-level spells.  However, most important spellcasters are immune to life drainage, and those that aren't generally have very high [[Monster MR|MR]], making the spell nearly useless.  [[Stormbringer]] and [[the Staff of Aesculapius]] bypass monster MR, though both will kill most non-resistant monsters quickly enough that the effect on their spellcasting is not generally that noticeable.

=== Ray-type spells ===

Ray-type spells come in three varieties{{refsrc|mcastu.c|270}} (though only two are in use).  They can be cast from afar, and when used this way, act the same as [[wand]]s or [[breath weapon]]s.  When cast from an adjoining square, they act as [[melee]] attacks and cannot be [[reflection|reflected]], but the appropriate resistance will still nullify them.
* Three creatures use [[magic missile]]: [[Angel]]s, [[Yeenoghu]] and the [[Oracle]] (the Oracle's version is passive and will only occur in response to a melee attack).  [[Magic resistance]] is proof against this attack.  The message is, "You are hit by a shower of missiles!"  "The missiles bounce off!" if you have magic resistance.
* [[Asmodeus]], and no one else, has a [[cold]] attack.  "You are covered in frost" when hit by this attack.  [[Cold resistance]] nullifies it.
* The source code also supports a [[fire]] attack.  "You are enveloped in flames" when hit by this attack, and [[fire resistance]] nullifies it.  No monster in vanilla has this attack.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] has many new spellcasting monsters, including [[fire vampire]]s which use the previously-unimplemented fire ray spell. It also introduces two new mage spells:
*[[Call undead]], which can be used by all [[lich]]es (and no other monsters);
*[[Create pool]], which can be used by monsters of level 13 or higher.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], monsters use the same spellcasting system as the player, and can also read [[spellbooks]] to acquire new spells. This makes higher-level spellcasting monsters much more dangerous. Low-level spellcasting monsters (kobold shamans, orc shamans and gnomish wizards) no longer approach you due to lacking melee ability, and will instead attempt to line up with you in order to cast spells.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], if you are polymorphed into a monster with spellcasting attacks in their routine and you have enough spare power, attacking in melee will cause you to randomly use one of their available spells; the spellcasting attack fails if you do not have enough power.

'''Snakes''' are a class of [[monster]] in [[NetHack]] represented by the overall symbol {{white|S}}. They are generally [[poison]]ous and have the capability to hide under [[item]]s dropped on the ground.

The '''snake''', {{monsym|snake}}, is also the second-weakest member of this class (next to the [[garter snake]]). It is poisonous if eaten.

If a snake is created during the initial level generation process, NetHack will generate a random item for the snake to hide under.{{refsrc|makemon.c|1159|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=snakes get a free house}} This method of item generation accounts for a significant portion of the items in the [[archeologist quest]].

In the dungeon you will encounter the following kinds of snakes:
* {{monsymlink|garter snake}}
* {{monsymlink|snake}}
* {{monsymlink|water moccasin}}
* {{monsymlink|pit viper}}
* {{monsymlink|python}}
* {{monsymlink|cobra}}

== Body parts ==
'''Snake''' also refers to the grouping of body parts for the forms of snakes. It affects the messages referring to the appropriate body parts as follows:

{{encyclopedia|
Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.  And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:  but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
 
And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done?  And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

The '''garter snake''', {{monsym|garter_snake}}, is a variety of [[snake]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Unlike most of their brethren, they are not [[poisonous]], but can [[hide]] under objects and may prove to be an annoyance when generating in large [[groups]].

Garter snakes are often the first hiding monsters a player may encounter.

==Generation==
Garter snakes can appear in groups of 2 to 11, and will occasionally generate as peaceful towards [[neutral]] player characters.

==Strategy==
Garter snakes are quite harmless on their own, but their tendency to appear early and in groups can spell doom for a weaker or careless character, though they can be handled fairly easily otherwise. Their ability to hide makes for a rude surprise when encountered in [[shop]]s, though not nearly to the level of most [[mimic]]s. Pets that are not terribly weak themselves should have no trouble dispatching a group of them.

==History==
Garter snakes first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Garter snake}}
Garter snakes are a group of generally harmless, small to medium-sized snakes commonly known snakes found in North America. While real garter snakes are venomous, they are only mildly so, and they can only become poisonous by feeding on toxic newts and retaining those toxins.

The '''xan''', {{monsym|xan}}, is a [[monster]] in [[NetHack]]. Xans are capable of [[flight]], and their [[corpse]] is poisonous to eat.

It has a unique attack that targets your legs, resulting in [[wounded legs]] if the attack succeeds. A [[Cancellation|canceled]] xan cannot injure your legs, and instead "nuzzles" them.

==Strategy==
Boots can protect your legs from the xan's attacks - worn [[iron shoes]] or [[low boots]] protect you 40% of the time, and any other boots protect you 80% of the time.{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1219|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} As indicated above, cancelling a xan can render it harmless.

==History==
Before [[NetHack 3.6.3]], [[riding]], flying, or [[levitation|levitating]] would prevent a xan from wounding your legs. As xans themselves fly, this was considered a [[bug]] and fixed.
