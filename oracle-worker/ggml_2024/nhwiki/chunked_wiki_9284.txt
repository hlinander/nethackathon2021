If the PC's alignment record is between 3 and -3, it is not possible to use this move.

=== Bird kick ===
All adjacent targets are [[kick]]ed once. Having high encumbrance can cause the kick to fail as normal.

=== Wing storm (Chiropterans only) ===
All adjacent targets are knocked back up to 4 squares. This deals no damage, but does stun and slow the targets.

=== Meteor drive ===
A single target in front of the PC is thrown downwards. If the target is standing on ordinary room terrain, corridor, soil, sand, grass, or a doorway, they take size- and strength-dependent damage.

=== Flurry/Pummel ===
A single target in front of the PC is attacked twice with the PC's normal attack.

&&%s&& %s Monk revision (dnethack) {148250 2022-09-27T21:46:43Z {4000354 Chris} /* Weapon special maneuvers */  Add nunchucks Monks are currently in the process of being revised in [[dNetHack]].

== Monk moves ==

Monks now have [[Monk_moves_(dnethack)|"fighting game"-style special moves]] that are triggered by two-move sequences of attacks or moves. Each of these moves costs 8 magic energy. Moves can be toggled on and off using #style, which is useful since they trigger without the player's explicit input.

== Meditation ==

Monks now "meditate" while skipping turns with '.', recovering magic energy at slightly over twice the normal rate and using half the normal amount of nutrition.

== Fasting ==

Monks now lose nutrition at half the normal rate while "hungry" or worse. This stacks with the reduction in hunger from Meditation.

== Leaping attack ==

If a Monk collides with an enemy (that they can see) while hurtling through the air, they make a full attack against the target. If the Monk's [[partial action]] hasn't been used this turn and the attack moves the target out of the way (whether due to death or displacement) the monk will continue hurtling, otherwise they will stop in front of the target.

Monks can use this in combination with a source of [[jump]]ing to launch themselves through weak enemies.

== Weapon special maneuvers ==

=== Quarterstaff and khakkhara ===

Monks can '''jump''' while wielding one of these weapons. The range will be equal to a jumping spell cast at the lower of their quarterstaff skill and their martial arts skill. Expert quarterstaff combined with master or grand master martial arts grants additional range.

=== Shuriken ===

Monks throw shuriken as a partial action. In addition, shuriken no longer [[mulch]] on impact with enemies.

=== Nunchaku ===

All characters can apply nunchaku to disarm a target. Monks can perform this disarm maneuver as a [[partial action]].

The '''illithid''' (also known as a [[mind flayer]]) is a playable race of monster that appears in [[EvilHack]] and [[SlashTHEM]].

==EvilHack==
First introduced in version 0.4.0, EvilHack portrays illithids as an ancient race with psychic abilities and natural spellcasting ability, but they are physically weak compared to other beings.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-040 EvilHack changelog]</ref> 

Illithids are a [[chaotic]] race, and can be played as a [[Convict]], [[Infidel]], [[Priest]], or [[Wizard]].

===Racial benefits and restrictions===
Player illithids have [[infravision]], and gain more power generation per level than even [[Elf (starting race)|elven]] characters. They possess a natural psionic attack that can confuse and kill and is tied to spell [[power]] use, but is not considered a spell for the purposes of interactions with the [[Amulet of Yendor]]; metal [[helm]]s block the ability to use the psionic wave, and illithids that have their race changed lose the ability until they return to normal (i.e., in the case of crowning as an Infidel, it is lost indefinitely).

Illithids start out with intrinsic [[psychic resistance]] and [[telepathy]], and gain [[flight]] at level 12 like their more "wild" mind flayer brethren.

Illithids have a single extra tentacle attack that behaves exactly like the tentacle attack from a mind flayer, set up in such a way that it will automatically not be used if attacking something the player should not touch unprotected (e.g., [[cockatrice]]s). Mind flayers and other monsters with psychic resistance are immune to intelligence drain from brain-eating attacks, and a player illithid is likewise immune to having their own brain eaten (but not to any other effects, such as possibly-fatal [[illness]] from a zombie bite).

====Attribute caps====
{| class="prettytable"
!| Character<br>[[Race]]
!| [[Strength]]
!| [[Dexterity]]
!| [[Constitution]]
!| [[Intelligence]]
!| [[Wisdom]]
!| [[Charisma]]
|-
|| Illithid || 10 || 20 || 12 || 22 || 22 || 16
|}

Illithids have exceptional agility and mental prowess that surpass even elves, but are the weakest among playable races in terms of physical strength.

====Price adjustments====
The following price adjustments are used for illithid interactions with [[Racial monster|racial]] [[shopkeeper]]s:

{|class="wikitable"
!colspan="1" rowspan="2"| !! colspan="9"|Shopkeeper's race
|-
! Human/Other !! Elf !! Dwarf !! Orc !! Gnome !! Illithid !! Centaur !! Nymph !! Giant
|-
|rowspan="1"|Illithid || &times;1 || &times;2 || &times;2 || &times;1 || &times;{{frac|3|2}} if [[Int|INT]] is ≤14<br/>&times;{{frac|4|3}} if INT is 15-17 || &times;1 || &times;{{frac|3|2}} || &times;{{frac|4|3}} if [[Cha|CHA]] is ≥15<br/>&times;{{frac|5|3}} if CHA is <15 || &times;{{frac|4|3}}
|}

Of note is that player illithids are the only race not subjected to a 1000% markup from illithid shopkeepers.

===Starting equipment===
In addition to normal starting equipment for their role, illithids always start with the [[psionic wave]] ability; in previous versions, a "spellbook" of the ability would be included in the initial inventory of any non-Convict illithid.

====Strategy====
The illithid's psychic resistance makes them immune to zombification, providing insulation against one of the biggest early-game threats in EvilHack's revamped zombies. However, they can still die as a result of the bites being poisoned, and their low strength and constitution caps make them incredibly frail. Their carrying capacity is also quite low, making a [[bag of holding]] an even more vital resource for them due to the weight reduction.

Early [[wish]]es for illithids often include [[gauntlets of power]] to offset their low strength, with [[bone]] and [[wood]] as popular [[Object materials (EvilHack)|choices of material]] due to being lighter and spellcaster-friendly. [[Stone]] is also viable in this regard and even provides an extra point of base [[AC]], though it is heavier compared to other materials; this is somewhat offset by keeping them worn where possible.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Illithid}}
Illithids, also known as mind flayers, are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''; the illithid is considered "Product Identity" by Wizards of the Coast. Creator Gary Gygax stated that one of his inspirations was the cover painting of the Titus Crow book ''The Burrowers Beneath'' by Brian Lumley. They appear in all editions, and were first described in the very first 1975 issue of TSR Games' official newsletter ''The Strategic Review''; they were included in the ''Eldritch Wizardry'' supplement for the original white box edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and further appear in the first edition's Monster Manual. The 3rd and 3.5 editions introduce playable illithids.

In the various ''Dungeons & Dragons'' settings and many other works featuring them, the origins of the illithids are subject to many conflicting stories: A common thread in regards to ''Wizards'' properties and similar works is that illithid society by and large seeks to rebuild their former empires, wherein all other species were their slaves. As a result, they view any sentient creature as worthy only of being their slaves or their food; despite this, they are pragmatic and will trade with other races who are too strong to be conquered. Illithids also fear undead, as they are immune to telepathic detection and manipulation and often have no brains to consume.

Illithid dwellings are structured around a creature called an "[[elder brain|Elder Brain]]", which lives in a pool of cerebral fluid in the center of a city. Illithids have their brain extracted upon death and taken to the pool to be added to the collective that the Brain represents, which they believed a form of immortality; the Elder Brain thus also functions in part as a vast library of knowledge that other illithids can call upon. Psionic potential is an integral part of illithid identity - those who study wizardry often risk becoming outcasts (somewhat unlike EvilHack illithids), as magical power cannot be absorbed into the Brain. A limited study of wizardry is tolerated insofar as it allows illithid society to better understand the powers of their enemies - illithids outcast for going too far with these studies often seek another form of immortality through undeath, becoming [[alhoon]]s.

Illithids typically communicate through psychic means, projecting thoughts and feelings to each other in a way non-illithids can scarcely comprehend. Their rare forays into written language are known as "qualith", a series of marks consisting of four broken lines that functions like an extremely complex braille; illithids read this by using each tentacle to feel the breaks in the lines and comprehend all four of them simultaneously. In EvilHack, the spellbook of psionic wave is written in a language that only player illithids can comprehend, and other playable races cannot read the book.

==Common traits==
All demon lords and princes are [[covetous]], and will warp to you when they detect you, and to the up stairs to flee and heal. They will pick up the [[Amulet of Yendor]] if they can, and attack any monster carrying it other than the [[high priest]] of Moloch and the [[Wizard of Yendor]]. Orcus additionally covets the [[Book of the Dead]].

Like their lesser brethren, the unique demons have [[fire resistance]], [[poison resistance]], [[drain resistance]], and resistance to death magic including rays from the [[wand of death|wand]] or [[Finger of death|spell]]; they also nominally respect [[Elbereth]], although it has no power in their native [[Gehennom]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Elbereth no longer affects unique monsters.

Any level in Gehennom where a demon lord or prince is present is considered a [[non-teleport level]] for you and any monster that isn't a demon lord or prince.}}

===Rank===
A demon's rank has no effect on its combat prowess, but does affect some other aspects of the game:
* [[Demon#Demons summoning demons|Demon gating]] will summon a demon at most one rank over the original one, so major demons can't summon princes. Princes are more likely than lords to summon other unique demons. Demon gating by a [[polyself]] can't summon lords or princes.
* Same-race sacrifice will summon a lord, or a major demon if both lords have been generated. It will never summon a prince.

===Bribery===
Lawful demon princes are generated [[peaceful]]. When one detects you, it will warp to you and demand some portion of your carried [[gold]]. If you pay it off, it will vanish from the game; if you refuse, or have no gold, it will turn hostile. You may shortchange it up to 39 gold with a chance of success. If the demon has the Amulet, the bribe will always be more than you have, so that the demon and Amulet aren't removed from the game.

If you are polymorphed into any {{monclass|&}}, the prince won't ask for a bribe, but will remain on the map, peaceful, until you deal with it.

Wielding [[Excalibur]] causes lawful princes to be generated hostile, so they won't ask for a bribe. They will turn hostile if you wield Excalibur when they would demand a bribe, or if fooled by your [[displacement]].

Chaotic demons are always generated hostile (except when summoned by a chaotic character's same-race [[sacrifice]]), and will attack on sight.

==Lairs==
Four of the demons have their own lairs in [[Gehennom]]. All four lairs are guaranteed to be generated, which means you're almost certain to see all four demons if your character gets that far. However, all four lairs can also leave [[bones]], so it's possible for a demon not to appear in its own lair if it was previously dispatched or led away. As each of them are unique, they will also be absent if generated by other means (e.g. sacrifice or other demons).

==Strategy==
Although demon lords and princes are statistically some of the most powerful monsters by the numbers, many of them are not guaranteed encounters, and most players have had plenty of time to prepare for the rest by the point that they first encounter any. Asmodeus is nearly impotent against a fire- and cold-resistant character, for example, and Baalzebub's gaze won't penetrate a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]]. At the other end of the spectrum, Orcus' spells can cause trouble for even magic-resistant characters, and Demogorgon can kill almost anyone should he appear. Players who lack good [[AC]] or essential resistances may have more difficulty.

Those playing for a [[speed ascension]] will generally elect to bribe Asmodeus and Beelzebub, and with a [[unicorn horn]] or other cure for illness Juiblex can be disposed of easily (with a [[wand of digging]] expediting the process), leaving Orcus as the most difficult remaining ruler to face. [[Pacifist]]s generally have trouble finding [[pet]]s willing to attack such high-level creatures, especially since all demons are drain-resistant, and generally have to resort to bribery for similar reasons. A blessed [[figurine]] of an [[Archon]] is usually a go-to pacifist [[wish]] for this among many other reasons: they can reach level 28 with little effort, become immune to [[conflict]] at level 25, and can also be given a powerful kit and potions of {{! of|gain level}} in order to deal with demon lords and princes, as well as other higher-level monsters like the [[Wizard of Yendor]].

The '''Magic 8-Ball''' is an [[artifact]] that appears in ''[[EvilHack]]''. It is unaligned, and its base item is a [[plastic]] [[eight ball]]. 

==Generation==
The Magic 8-Ball is always found in the possession of the [[Oracle]] on her level. It cannot be [[wish]]ed for due to its generation method, but does not affect wishing for other artifacts.

==Description==
The Magic 8-Ball is implied to be the source of the Oracle's knowledge.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/v0.7.1/include/artilist.h#L216 EvilHack 0.7.1 include/artilist.h, line 216]</ref> It grants [[warning]] when carried, and can be [[applied]] to divulge a random [[rumor]] - the rumor will be true or false based on the artifact's [[beatitude]]: true if blessed, false if cursed, and an equal probability of each if uncursed. Additionally, there is a {{frac|100,000}} chance that applying the blessed Magic 8-Ball will grant the user a [[wish]], which causes it to disappear. 

[[Read]]ing the Magic 8-Ball randomly generates one of twenty responses that have no effect.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Magic 8-Ball}}
A Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere made to look like an oversized billiards eight-ball, used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman, and is currently manufactured by Mattel; originally designed as a paperweight, it has since become a popular office toy and children's toy. The Magic 8-Ball contains a blue twenty-sided die with white letters in a pool of blue liquid; the user asks a yes–no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.

In fiction, the Magic 8-Ball is often used for humor, with it giving very accurate, very inaccurate, or otherwise statistically improbable answers. The standard Magic 8-Ball has 20 possible responses when read - 10 affirmative answers, 5 non-committal answers, and 5 negative answers - that the artifact in EvilHack uses.

It is the first of the new branches added to the variant. All three levels are [[no-teleport level]]s, with [[undiggable]] floors and walls.

==Generation==
The Ice Queen's Realm is accessed via a [[magic portal]] that can always be found in the [[Dungeons of Doom]], on the floor above [[Medusa's Island]].

==First level==
The first level is set in the midst of a frozen river that winds through a dark forest mostly comprised of [[dead tree]]s, though some live [[tree]]s are also present.

The portal is set in the southeastern region, and the down stair in the northwest. Nearby is the [[corpse]] of an [[Archeologist (player monster)|archeologist]] named Carl the Excavator; on the same square is a [[fedora]] and a [[novel]] named "The Adventurer's Journal". Both items are uncursed.

Four [[frost salamander]]s patrol the icy river, and a quartet composed of [[goblin outrider]]s and their [[goblin-captain|captain]] are generated just outside of a ring of dead trees around the stairway. Within the ring of trees, a [[snow golem]] guards the staircase down. Nine other random monsters are placed around the map at level creation. There are additionally an [[axe]] and [[battle-axe]], as well as a [[crystal chest]], randomly placed on the map, as well as five [[bear trap]]s and three [[spear trap]]s.

The icy river is "composed" of many frozen [[pool]]s. The dead trees surrounding the stairway cannot be [[phase]]d through, and must be chopped down or otherwise removed to gain access; the guaranteed axe and battle-axe are provided for this purpose.

==Second level==
The second level is a vast icy plain, with a gorge running through the middle of it. There is only one path across the gorge, which is heavily defended by several monsters.

The stairway from the first level leads out into a narrow passage that connects the two cliffsides, with the [[Abominable Snowman]] placed in the middle of the pass - it stands in front of a [[spiked pit]], with a [[spear trap]] behind the pit. A trio of [[revenant]]s is generated a short distance from the up stair, just in front of a bear trap.

Further south, a [[saber-toothed tiger]] is generated next to the corpse of a [[Wizard (player monster)|wizard]] named Tim the Enchanter; there is a [[cornuthaum]] and a random [[spellbook]] on top of the corpse, both of which are uncursed. Four frost salamanders are generated at the marked locations above; a [[frost giant]] and a [[mastodon]] are generated near the down stair; and 12 random monsters are randomly placed around the level.

It may be wise to lure the Abominable Snowman off the gorge pass towards the east if you plan on keeping the pass boulder-free; at least one boulder is worth leaving intact in order to fill up the spiked bit blocking the west end of the pass. [[Giant (starting race)|Giant]] players can catch the boulders and either hold on to them or lob them back at the Abominable Snowman.

==Third level==
The third and final level is the [[treasure zoo]]-filled castle of the Ice Queen, who awaits within the innermost room alongside her loyal guardians.

The stairway from the second level is placed in the southwest of the courtyard outside the castle. All of the castle's doors are locked, and [[iron bars]] can be seen on the watch towers of the castle. A [[woolly mammoth]], a frost giant, and a saber-toothed tiger are generated just outside the entrance; blocking the doors are a pair of spear traps. [[Ice troll]]s are stationed in the watch towers, each generated with 100 [[orcish arrow]]s and an [[orcish bow]] (both uncursed).

Three unlit treasure zoos are present within the castle, which is structured so that you must pass through at least two of them. Iron bars within each of the "side" zoos connect them to the foyer, patrolled by a pair of snow golems. Two pairs of [[ice devil]]s are stationed outside and within the easternmost room, which is a temple to [[Moloch]] with a [[aligned priest|priest]] of [[Racial monster|a random race]] present - the code implies that this priest assisted the evil witch that placed the curse upon Kathryn, transforming her into the Ice Queen.

[[Kathryn the Ice Queen]] and her pets [[Bourbon]] and [[Ozzy]] await beyond the foyer in the center-most room of the castle; next to Kathryn is a [[grave]] for Koa, and each of the dogs generate in front of a [[fountain]]. Kathryn is generated hostile, while Bourbon and Ozzy are peaceful, but they will become hostile once you attack Kathryn. Defeating Kathryn the Ice Queen turns her into Kathryn the Enchantress, rendering her and her pets peaceful, with one exception - if playing as an [[Infidel]], Kathryn the Enchantress will be hostile towards the player. She is still grateful for being released from her curse, but she will not tolerate evil; as such, she will grant the Infidel 100 turns of safe passage before she becomes mobile and attacks.

A crystal chest is placed in each corner of the room; the lower-right crystal chest has 3 [[apple]]s, 3 [[orange]]s, 3 potions of {{! of|acid}}, an uncursed saddle, and a 20% chance of [[barding]] being generated (80% chance of [[spiked barding]], 20% chance for [[barding of reflection]]). The barred cage in the west end of Kathryn's room holds the prizes for the branch: a [[pegasus]] is generated peaceful and asleep within the cage, with 4 piles of 2000 [[zorkmid]]s inside; a pegasus [[egg]] has a {{frac|5}} chance of being generated underneath the sleeping pegasus on its marked square. The marked square also has a crystal chest that holds the [[Bag of the Hesperides]]; there is also a 10% chance of a [[magic marker]] appearing inside the chest. The guaranteed potions of acid found in one of the crystal chests can be used to melt the iron bars.

==The Adventurer's Journal==
The novel found on the archeologist corpse in the first level is a source of hints describing various aspects of the branch and its inhabitants.

====First entry====
 While exploring the Dungeons of Doom, I stumbled upon a magical portal, 
 transporting me to an inhospitable, frigid wasteland.  It looks as if   
 the forest here died ages ago... so many dead trees.  The freezing cold 
 is unbearable - I must find a means to keep myself warm, or I may freeze
 to death.                                                               
                                                                        
 There is a frozen river nearby, perhaps it leads somewhere?  I shall    
 investigate, and may [[Quetzalcoatl]] protect me.                           
                                                                        
====Second entry====
 So many strange and exotic creatures in this dead forest!  All of them 
 adapted to the extreme conditions here.  I thought salamanders prefered
 only the extreme heat of the lava caves... who knew?  And I swear to   
 whoever may read this, I have seen the largest cat anyone has ever laid
 eyes on.  As big as a warhorse, and its fangs were the size of swords, 
 Quetzalcoatl as my witness!                                            
                                                                        
 My intellect tells me to turn around and leave this place immediately, 
 but my gut tells me I am on to something much more important.  I will  
 continue my explorations.                                              

====Third entry====
 I have searched this forsaken forest for nearly three days, and finally     
 I believe I have found a way forward.  I stumbled upon a thicket of dead    
 trees to the northwest whilst fleeing from yet another pack of hungry       
 winter wolves.  In a last-ditch attempt to save myself, I chopped my way    
 through the thicket, which revealed a small clearing.  In this clearing     
 was a path leading out of the forest.  As I was about to make my way        
 through, I caught a glipse of something huge moving towards me.  I couldn't 
 quite make out what it was, it seemed as if it blended right in with the    
 surrounding snow.  I ran for my life and hid, and only now have I dared to  
 venture out and try for the clearing again.  May the Luck of the Grasshopper
 be with me!                                                                  

====Fourth entry====
 I have left one place of immense danger, only to stumble into another place
 even more dangerous than the first.  The dead forest has given way to an
 utterly barren icy plain, with a deep gorge running through the middle of it.
 A very narrow ice bridge connects this side to the other, but I fear I
 cannot cross.  Some enormous monster guards this ice bridge; I dared not get
 close enough to find out what this immense creature might be.  I fear I may
 have to turn back, otherwise I could very well die in this godforsaken place.

====Fifth entry====
 This may be my last entry, but I pray to Quetzalcoatl that it is not.  I am
 attempting to make my way back to the magical portal that transported me
 here, but I am pursued at every turn.  The terrifying undead creatures that
 inhabit this place are relentless, and their very touch paralyzes you with
 fear.
 
 Whilst fleeing, I stumbled across the corpse of another adventurer,
 a powerful wizard.  His journal described a castle that resides even further
 in, beyond the ice bridge that I did not cross.  He made mention of a powerful
 sorceress that lives in this castle, and she is the one responsible for this
 never-ending winter that afflicts this land.  She is guarded by extremely
 vicious monsters, and he went on to mention that she had in her possession
 some sort of prize that was beyond the wealth of even the most powerful kings.
 
 Tempting to be sure, but I wish to live.  I will return to this realm and seek
 out these riches.  I just need to make it out of this place alive first...

==Strategy==
A source of [[cold resistance]] is required to travel safely within the levels - similar to [[Gehennom]], entering without any source of the resistance will cause your [[hit points]] to slowly deplete, with the cold damage dependent on the amount of cold resistance you possess. Various cold-resistant monsters are generated on each level, and their [[corpse]]s should be enough to obtain full 100% resistance if you lack either that or a [[ring of cold resistance|ring]].

Crossing the widespread ice can be hazardous without [[water walking boots]], or else a [[levitation]] or [[flight]] source - a monster that has an item capable of creating [[fire]] can melt it away and drown you, though this is just as much of a hazard for other monsters. As such, the odds of a monster generating with a [[wand of fire]] in the Ice Queen's Realm are lower.<ref>https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/324d4b2d8f37b1459e4c29b8459c90a42633fbdc EvilHack commit 324d4b2: "Adjust odds of a wand of fire randomly appearing in a monster's ..."]</ref>

==History==
The Ice Queen's Realm was added to the game in a commit that also introduced dead trees to EvilHack (modified adapted from [[UnNetHack]]) alongside the various unique monsters that appear within the branch,  prior to the release of version 0.5. The same commit also added the [[Hell]]-like trait of constant HP loss without [[fire resistance]] to [[Gehennom]]. The developer, [[User:K2]], had promised his then-seven-year-old daughter Kathryn in 2019 that he would add her and their dogs to EvilHack; Kathryrn loves the movie ''[[wikipedia:Frozen|Frozen]]'' and likes to pretend she has Elsa's ice magic.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/113aae435bc8823acc978097f99a19aaf9f3b2b1 New branch: The Ice Queen's Realm.]</ref> 

==Messages==
{{message|You hear a howling wind.<br>You hear an eerie, ominous wail.<br>You hear someone singing "Do You Want to Build a Snowman".|The portal to the Ice Queen's Realm is present on the level.}}
{{message|You arrive in a frozen, barren wasteland.<br>The remnants of a once majestic forest stretch out before you.|These messages are displayed upon entering the branch for the first time.}}

A '''frost salamander''', {{brightblue|:}}, is a monster that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is an icy counterpart to the standard [[salamander]], and only resides in cold areas. Similar to their fiery counterparts, frost salamanders can wear all armor except boots and wield weapons.

Eating a frost salamander's corpse conveys a high percentage of [[cold resistance]].

==Generation==
Frost salamanders are only randomly generated in the [[Ice Queen's Realm]].

==Strategy==
While frost salamanders are incapable of [[drowning]] you like their fiery cousins, their strong attacks and cold damage can prove perilous for the unprepared. A simple approach to disposing of frost salamanders is drowning them by melting the [[ice]] from underneath them - similar to normal salamanders and [[lava]], frost salamanders will stay on ice tiles whenever possible. Most [[fire]] sources - a [[fire horn]], [[wand of fire]], or even a [[scroll of fire]] (preferably blessed) - are acceptable for this; even if you do not opt to drown them, frost salamanders are vulnerable to fire attacks as well.

If you entered the Ice Queen's Realm without full intrinsic cold resistance, frost salamander corpses are a good source of the property.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
For hundreds of years, many people believed that salamanders were magical.  In England in the Middle Ages, people thought that fire created salamanders.  When they set fire to damp logs, dozens of the slimy creatures scurried out.  The word salamander, in fact, comes from a Greek word meaning "fire animal".

The '''Abominable Snowman''', {{brightcyan|Y}}, is a unique monster that appears in [[EvilHack]]. Among its three attacks, it has a powerful bite and a claw swipe that can send the target flying back; it is also capable of lifting and throwing [[boulder]]s, and can freeze [[pool]]s of water underneath it as it moves.

==Generation==
The Abominable Snowman appears on the second floor of the [[Ice Queen's Realm]], where it is generated in the middle of the gorge's narrow pass on level creation. It is [[monster starting inventory|always generated with]] a dozen boulders in its inventory.

==Strategy==
The Abominable Snowman's ice power makes it immune to [[drowning]], and the boulders it will pelt you with can obstruct the pass. It is typically worth keeping a [[wand of striking]] or two around so that non-[[Giant (starting race)|giant]] characters can break them and pass by; casters such as [[Healer]]s can also try the [[stone to flesh]] spell.

==Origin==
The Abominable Snowman is also known as the [[Yeti]], an iconic cryptozoological animal said to inhabit the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet. Folklorists trace the origin of the Yeti to a combination of factors, including the folklore of pre-Buddhist Himalayan cultures such as the [[wikipedia:Sherpa people|Sherpa people]], and misidentified fauna such as bears or yak. The Abominable Snowman is often described as a large, bipedal ape-like creature that is covered with brown, gray, or white hair, and it is sometimes depicted as having large, sharp teeth.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.

'''The Forge''' is a [[special level]] that appears in [[NetHack: The Next Generation]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is the home of the blacksmith [[Duri]], a [[unique monster]] who can forge selected [[artifact weapon]]s for you, though the prices are suitably hefty depending on the chosen artifact.

While the artifacts that can be made at The Forge are all capable of generating in normal play, requesting an artifact from Duri is not subject to artifact generation rules, and uses different prices compared to the artifacts' typical base prices. All of the artifacts listed can also be obtained by normal methods, unless otherwise specified.

==NetHack: The Next Generation==
In NetHack: The Next Generation, the Forge has an 80% chance of being generated, and may appear anywhere from levels 15 to 19 within the Dungeons of Doom.

===Artifacts===
The following artifacts can be crafted by Duri; their base prices are listed below.
