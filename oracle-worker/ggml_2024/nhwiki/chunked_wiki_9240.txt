Next time:
 Once again, you stand outside Erelhei-Cinlu.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 You have the oddest feeling that this may be the last time you
 are to vist <i>(sic)</i> Erelhei-Cinlu.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "You have been granted an audience with Eclavdra.  Don't keep her waiting!"
 "The heretics of Eilistraee are besieging the city!"
 "Eclavdra will see to those pale-elf loving freaks."
 "The path to the surface passes through the drider caves. 
 Those failed priestesses have little respect for their betters!"
 "Hail Lolth!"

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "You have been granted an audience with Eclavdra.  Don't keep her waiting!"
 "The heretics of Eilistraee have been routed, praise be to Lolth!"
 "Eclavdra certainly saw to those pale-elf loving freaks."
 "I hope you taught those acursed <i>(sic)</i> driders some respect!"
 "Hail Lolth!"

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  It is good that you have answered my summons.
 Lolth requires your talents.
 
 "But first, I must evaluate your abilities, to see if you 
 have the required abilities to take on this holy mission."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Once again, <playername>, you stand in our midst.  Are you ready now?"

This message is not currently used:
 "Ah, you are here again, <playername>.  I will test your readiness..."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "<playername>!  You have doomed yourself.  You fairly radiate lawful influences,
 showing your treachery for all to see.
 
 "You are hereby banished!  I revoke the grace of Lolth from you!"

When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "<playername>, you are yet too inexperienced to withstand the demands of
 Lolth's holy mission.  An An'kin might just be able to do this thing.
 
 "Return to us when you are worthy of this honor."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "You have strayed, <playername>!  You know that Lolth requires
 that we maintain a pure devotion to things chaotic!
 
 "Return when you have purified yourself, and not before!"

When finally assigned the quest:
 "You are indeed ready, <playername>.  This is your mission,
 your holy quest from Lolth:
 
 "The heretics of Eilistraee, treacherous daughter of Lolth,
 have been sending missionaries into the city, infecting
 our citizens with their debased teachings.
 
 "This outrage cannot be alowed to stand. Your mission is
 to travel through the drider caves and up to the surface,
 locate the grove of Eilistraee, and kill her heretic
 priestess.  Bring me Silver Starlight, her unholy sword,
 as proof of your deed!
 
 "Do this, and know the glory of Lolth! Fail, and know
 everlasting torment! Go now!"

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "There are many secret passages in the drider caves."
 "Why are you still here?  Get on with it, or face the wrath of Lolth!"
 "Go now!"
 "Serve Lolth in all things!"
 "The Eilistraee heretics seek to bring down the clergy of Lolth."
 "Eilistraee and her followers have always hated us."
 "The blasphemous missionaries have set off a quake that shall bury
 them alive!"
 "Driders are strong, but they enjoy not the favor of Lolth."
 "You tempt the wrath of Lolth with your delay."
 "The heretics have formed a blasphemous alliance with the surface
 elves."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 You descend into the outer regions of the drider caves.  You can hear
 scuffling sounds in the corridors, and vague mumblings in the distance.
 
 You know that there were many secret passageways in this complex.

When returning:
 Once again, you descend into the drider caves.

When first entering the goal level:
 You have arrived at the Grove of Eilistraee.  The accursed sunlight still
 fills your eyes with painful darkness, but in the center of the trees 
 you can hear voices raised in song, singing naive, heathen melodies in
 honor of the bitch-goddess Eilistraee.

When returning:
 Once again, you enter the Grove of Eilistraee.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "Wait, <playername>!?  <playername>, is it really you?  It's me, Seyll Auzkovyn!
 
 "We were friends as girls, do you not recall?  Has Eclavdra sent you to 
 kill me?  She is using you, decieving you. She fears to come and 
 confront me herself, fears to leave the Underdark and face the sunlight.
 
 "Please, give me a chance!  What we were taught as girls is not the truth.
 Lolth is a wicked deity, not worthy of our service.  She has turned 
 generations of drow against one another for her own amusement, just as she
 has turned us against each other now.  Think, what the drow could do,
 if we did not kill nine-tenths of our daughters in futile fratricide and
 assassinations!
 
 "We have a chance to break this cycle!  If we can free Erelhei-Cinlu from
 the clergy of Lolth, our acts will reverberate from one side of the 
 Underdark to the other!"

Upon further meetings:
 "Please, speak to me!"

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "Lolth is not worthy of your service!"

When you have Silver Starlight, but Seyll Auzkovyn is still alive:
 "That blade was a gift from Eilistraee!"

====Discouragement====

Seyll Auzkovyn will occasionally utter "maledictions":
 "Lolth has turned us against each other!"
 "Think of your daughters! Do you want their blood spilt in petty squabbles!?"
 "Help us end this!"
 "Please don't make me kill you!"
 "We have a chance to break this cycle!"
 "Eclavdra is using you!"
 "Help me free Erelhei-Cinlu!"
 "What we were taught as girls is not the truth!"
 "Don't you remember your sister!?  Did you truly feel nothing, when you
 drove the blade into her heart!?  Help me put an end to the killing!"
 "You must not stop me.  I'll kill you, if I must!  But please, trust 
 me!  Talk to me instead!"

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:
 The wind plays a mornful tune as it blows over Silver Starlight, 
 but it stops when you pick it up.  Eclavdra will accept this blade
 as proof that you have truly killed Seyll Auzkovyn.

When killing the nemesis:
 Seyll Auzkovyn falls to her knees, her life's-blood running down her chest and
 onto the grass.
 
     Perhaps- *cough* Perhaps I was a fool to think I could change
     the drow.  Perhaps I was a fool to stand against Lolth.
     
     But please, <playername>, don't forget me!  Remember what I told you,
     and you may yet escape the knife!
 
 She shivers for a moment longer, then lies still.

When returning to your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  You have destroyed the foul heretics!  I only wish Seyll Auzkovyn 
 had been taken alive, I would have liked to ... instruct her as to 
 the error of her ways.
 
 "Your name will be entered in the annals of Lolth, and the tale of how
 we bested the hordes of the traitor goddess Eilistraee will be told for
 generations to come.
 
 "You must now return to the Dungeons of Doom and your quest for the 
 Amulet of Yendor.  With that divine relic, Lolth will finally be able
 to put down her rebellious daughter!
 
 "Take Silver Starlight with you, if you wish.  Otherwise, you can take the 
 Wrathful Spider, with which to kill your foes from a distance."

When subsequently throwing Silver Starlight to Eclavdra:
 "This weapon was made by the surface elves for the high priestess
 of Eilistraee, Seyll Auzkovyn.  Befitting their obsession with frivolous music,
 it has a flute built into the handle.  It can also be used to create
 throwing stars, and imparts a silvery sheen to such weapons.
 
 "Would you like to use this weapon in your quest, or would you 
 prefer the ancient droven crossbow, the Wrathful Spider?"

When subsequently throwing the Wrathful Spider to Eclavdra:
 "This crossbow was made in the earliest days of our empire in
 the Underdark.  With it, one need never run out of bolts.  
 Unlike lesser crossbows, it can also fire multiple bolts in
 one volley, though the damage inflicted by each bolt is not
 so great."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Eclavdra after the quest:
 "How have you fared on your holy quest for the Amulet
 of Yendor?  Lolth does not tolerate failure!"

When talking to Eclavdra after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "You have it!  You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor!
 
 "Whoever brings that to Lolth's high altar in the astral plane will
 be exhalted above all others, and shall even be granted the rank of
 demigoddess!
 
 "I have been searching for that Amulet for many long years.  To 
 think a mere <currentrank> would find it first!
 
 "Well, I thank you for bringing it to me.  Your part in this
 is done.
 
 "Now DIE!"

==Messages if you switch sides==

===Entry===
The first time you return to the Grove of Eilistraee after switching sides:
 You have returned to the Grove of Eilistraee, home base of the 
 rebellion against the clergy of Lolth.

Subsequent visits:
 Once again, you have returned to the Grove of Eilistraee, 
 home base of the rebellion against the clergy of Lolth.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "We are so glad that you were able to shake off the webs of Lolth!"
 "The followers of Lolth have launched several assaults on this Grove!"
 "Seyll Auzkovyn was so relieved that you sided with us."
 "You will have to go back through the Drider caves to reach
 Erelhei-Cinlu. Though Lolth has betrayed them, the driders 
 have little use for the followers of Eilistraee!"
 "Eilistraee is not like her mother.  She saved us from the dark."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "We are so very glad that you were able to shake off the webs of Lolth!"
 "The followers of Lolth have been thrown into disarray!"
 "It's been a long time since I've seen Seyll Auzkovyn so happy."
 "I hope you didn't have to kill many of those unfortunate driders."
 "You have saved us and our goddess from the dark."

===Quest leader===

When you are given the quest:
 "<playername>!  I am so glad that you decided to trust us!
 
 "I think you already know what I must ask you to do:"
 
 "We had initially hoped to avoid bloodshed altogether,
 sending missionaries into Erelhei-Cinlu to start an underground
 religious countermovement.  And, indeed, met with some 
 initial success.  However, our efforts enraged Lolth, and
 Eclavdra, high priestess of Lolth, led a bloody purge of 
 our missionaries and converts.
 
 "Eclavdra has since taken the offensive against us,
 orchestrating a wide variety of assassination attempts
 and outright assaults.  I now see that we must carry the
 fight to Eclavdra and the matron-mothers if we are to have
 any chance of freeing Erelhei-Cinlu from Lolth's webs.
 
 "You must be our sword in this.  You will be able to 
 pass through the perimeter of Erelhei-Cinlu unchallenged.
 With a little good fortune, no one will know you've 
 joined Eilistraee before you confront Eclavdra!

When you are expelled from the quest for having changed alignment:
 "<playername>!  I thought I could trust you!  In your treachery, you have
 doomed yourself.  Lolth has revoked her grace from you, and now
 you have turned your back on Eilistraee as well.  I banish you
 to The Dungeons of Doom, and I pray to all the gods you one day find peace!

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "There are many secret passages in the drider caves."
 "Good luck!"
 "Eilistraee will be with you, I know it."
 "Lolth and her clergy must fall!"
 "We must free the drow!"
 "Go swiftly and silently."
 "For the sake of all drow, we must not fail!"
 "Watch out for driders."
 "Beware the wrath of Lolth.  Eclavdra will not be an easy opponent."
 "Eclavdra made a critical error, coming to the outskirts of Erelhei-Cinlu."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 You descend into the outer regions of the drider caves.  You can hear
 scuffling sounds in the corridors, and vague mumblings in the distance.
 
 You know that there were many secret passageways in this complex.

When returning:
 Once again, you descend into the drider caves.

When first entering the goal level:
 You have returned to you house's fortress on the outskirts of
 Erelhei-Cinlu.  The silver star of Lolth is still set over the gates, token of
 Eclavdra and the high council of the matron-mothers.
 
 The hour of reckoning is at hand.

When returning:
 Once again, you have returned to Erelhei-Cinlu.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "<playername>!  Lolth has told us of your treachery!  Prepare to die!

Upon further meetings:
 "Now you die!"

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "Accept your fate!  Die now!"

When you have the Tentacle Rod, but Eclavdra is still alive:
 "Give that back!"

====Discouragement====

Eclavdra will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "You dare turn against Lolth!?  Even in death you shall not know peace!"
 ""Seyll Auzkovyn is using you.  You won't survive this fight!"
 "Even a drider's fate is too good for you!"
 "I'll flay your soul!"
 "Even a zombie's fate is too good for you!"
 "You will never know peace!"
 "I'll kill you and anyone who ever gave you shelter!"
 "Your fate will be wispered <i>(sic)</i> of for generations to come!"
 "You, a hero?  Don't make me laugh!  You killed two of your sisters,
 stabbed one in the back and shot the other in the head, from ambush 
 no less!  It was masterfully done!  What makes you think that 
 Eilistraee would accept one such as you!"
 "Your hands are as bloody as any of us!  Eilistraee or Lolth, you
 will burn!"

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:
 The Rod's tentacles wave languidly at you as you pick it up.  There
 is something unwholesome about this weapon.  You almost fear to let
 it sense you.

When killing the nemesis:
 Eclavdra falls to her knees, blood running down her forehead and into
 her eyes.  She curses you:
 
     You haven't seen the last of me.  You shall never escape
     the webs of Lolth...  and there are others still who would
     avenge me, who are bound to my aid by pacts sealed in blood!
     Gods of rot and decay and lust.  Enjoy your brief victory,
     I will have my re-
 
 Her eyes go wide, and she vomits black ichor onto the ground.
 Tentacles sprout from the stain, and from the corruption spreading
 from her shadow.  The tentacles wave languidly for a moment, then
 strike with frightening speed, dragging her down into the suddenly
 contracting patch of corruption.

When returning to your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  You did it!  We'll use the opening you have given us to send
 the missionaries back in.  With a little help from Eilistraee, 
 we'll free this whole city from Lolth's foul webs!
 
 "If you're willing, you should now return to the Dungeons of Doom 
 and your quest for the Amulet of Yendor.  With that divine relic, 
 Eilistraee will finally be able to battle Lolth on equal footing,
 or even from a position of greater power!"
 
 "Take the Tentacle Rod with you, if you wish.  Otherwise, Eilistraee will gift
 you her greatest instrument, the Crescent Blade, that can cleave
 even the necks of goddesses!"

When subsequently throwing the Tentacle Rod to Seyll Auzkovyn:
 "This rod was gifted to Eclavdra while she served Zuggtmoy, demon
 lady of rot and corruption, then consort of the Elder Elemental
 Eye, the chained god Tharizdun, who seeks to consume all the
 worlds and all the gods thereof.
 
 Eclavdra and Zuggtmoy both betrayed the Eye, and each other, having 
 planned from the beginning to use it for their own ends.  Any 
 interaction with the Chained One is perilous, however, and its
 service is not easy to foreswear.  It was likely Tharizdun who
 sent the black tentacles that claimed Eclavdra as she lay dying.
 
 "The Rod itself seems free of the taint of its father, however,
 and there is little doubt that it is a powerful tool, 
 capable of augmenting spellcasting and multiple debilitating 
 attacks in melee.
 
 "Would you like to use this weapon in your quest, or would you
 prefer the Crescent Blade of Eilistraee?"

When subsequently throwing the Crescent Blade to Seyll Auzkovyn:
 "This blade was forged by Eilistraee as a weapon against her
 mother, Lolth.  It's pale moon-fires pass through armor, and
 it can cleave even the head of a goddess from her shoulders."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Seyll Auzkovyn after the quest:
 "Welcome back, <playername>.  How have you fared on your quest for the
 Amulet of Yendor?"

When talking to Seyll Auzkovyn after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "You have it!  You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor!
 Now, I will tell you what must be done:
 
 "The Amulet has within it magic, the capability to transport you to
 the Astral Plane, where the high altar of Eilistraee resides.
 
 "To activate this magic, you must travel upwards as far as you can.
 When you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to Eilistraee.
 
 "Thus will you fulfill your destiny."

'''Angband orcs''', found in [[dNetHack]], are much stronger than regular orcs, being survivors from the First Age.  In most cases, they appear only in the company of an [[orc of the ages of stars]].  As such, they will probably not be encountered until the [[ascension run]], at which point the character will probably be more than strong enough to deal with them.

However, Angband orcs do randomly generate in the Borehole, the lowest section of the Tolkien-themed Chaos quest. Angband orcs encountered at this point in the mid-game should not be taken lightly due to their high damage output.
