The '''queen ant''', {{cyan|a}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. They have a decently powerful bite and [[poison|venomous]] sting.

==Generation==
The queen ant is only found in [[anthole]]s, where a solitary queen is guarded by the rest of the ants within.

==Strategy==
Queen ants have the typical high speed associated with [[Team Ant]], moving twice as fast as normal characters and possessing two decently-damaging attacks. They lack [[monster magic resistance]] of any kind, but players looking to take advantage must hit through a solid [[AC]] of -8.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	This giant variety of the ordinary ant will fight just as
	fiercely as its small, distant cousin.  Various varieties
	exist, and they are known and feared for their relentless
	persecution of their victims.

The '''mind flayer larva''', {{brightmagenta|;}}, is a monster that appears in [[EvilHack]].

==Generation==
Mind flayer larva are only generated in mind flayer nurseries, which appear on or after dungeon level 20.

==Strategy==
While relatively weak in terms of stats and incapable of moving outside the shallow water they generate in, the mind flayer larva's sole attack can attach themselves to the player's face. A character that has a mind flayer larva attached to their face has only one turn to kill or remove it; if not removed in time, the larva will burrow itself into their brain, killing them instantly. Players that die in this way will arise as a [[mind flayer]] if their death leaves [[bones]].

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Mind flayer larva are only ever found in mind flayer nurseries, tended to by an adult mind flayer.  Relatively weak, they exist in shallow pools of water and will not venture from them.  They have one attack, which is to attempt to attach itself to its victims face.  If successful, the victim has only moments to kill or remove the mind flayer larva from its face.  If not removed in time, the mind flayer larva burrows itself into its victims brain, killing them instantly.  The larva controls the host body, feeding off of it and eventually growing into a full-grown mind flayer.

The '''giant cockroach''', {{green|a}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It has a [[poison]]ous bite that weakens [[constitution]], similar to a [[rabid rat]], and can [[hide]] under objects.

==Generation==
Giant cockroaches are not randomly generated, and only appear on levels that contain raw sewage - these occur rarely in the [[Gnomish Mines]], and always appear in the [[Mines' End]] level where the [[Rat King]] can be found. Certain [[unique demon]] lairs that contain sewage will contain many giant cockroaches on level creation.

==Strategy==
Giant cockroaches are small and fast, and can prove an unwelcome surprise for players that have yet to obtain [[poison resistance]].

The '''giant centipede''', {{orange|s}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]].

==Strategy==
Giant centipedes are especially nasty members of an already-aggravating monster class, with twice the speed of an average character and a powerful [[poison]]ous bite. To make matters worse, they possess a strong AC of -6 and can wrap themselves around their victims, stopping their escape.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	I observed here, what I had often seen before, that certain
	districts abound in centipedes.  Here they have light
	reddish bodies and blue legs; great myriapedes are seen
	crawling every where.  Although they do no harm, they excite
	in man a feeling of loathing.  Perhaps our appearance
	produces a similar feeling in the elephant and other large
	animals.  Where they have been much disturbed, they
	certainly look upon us with great distrust, as the horrid
	biped that ruins their peace.

The '''weredemon''', {{black|&}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is a former lesser demon that has been infected by a werewolf, and is the most powerful of the [[lycanthrope]]s present in the game. They are able to shift into a hell hound-form, {{red|d}}, and can summon actual [[hell hound]]s and/or other [[demon]]s to help them. Like all other lycanthropes, they can infect others with their bite.

==Generation==
Weredemons are the only demon-class monster that can spawn outside of [[Gehennom]].

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
In 1573, the Parliament of Dole published a decree, permitting the inhabitants of the Franche-Comte to pursue and kill a were-wolf or loup-garou, which infested that province, "notwithstanding the existing laws concerning the chase." The people were empowered to "assemble with javelins, halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs, to hunt and pursue the said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other penalty."  The hunt seems to have been successful, if we may judge from the fact that the same tribunal in the following year condemned to be burned a man named Giles Garnier, who ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured little children, "even on Friday."  The poor lycanthrope, it appears, had as slight respect for ecclesiastical feasts as the French pig, which was not restrained by any feeling of piety from eating infants on a fast day.

The '''saber-toothed tiger''', {{yellow|f}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is the most dangerous member of the {{monclass|f}} class that can be encountered in the game.

==Generation==
Saber-toothed tigers are only randomly generated in the [[Ice Queen's Realm]].

==Encyclopedia Entry==

{{encyclopedia|
The saber-toothed tiger, a common term for a member of the genus Smilodon, is perhaps the most well-known of the saber-toothed cats.  Notable for the long, dagger-like fangs from which the name of the genus is derived, these apex predators stalked mammoths, bison, and other large herbivores across the plains of prehistoric North America.

The '''hobbit pickpocket''', {{black|h}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. In versions prior to 0.7, they are known as '''hobbit rogues'''. They are similar to the "base" [[hobbit]], but have an additional theft attack similar to that of [[monkey]]s, and may carry some of a [[rogue]]'s trademark [[tools]].

==Generation==
In addition to standard starting inventory, hobbit pickpockets [[Monster starting inventory|have a chance to be generated with]] the following, as with regular hobbits: one of a [[dagger]], a [[elven dagger]], or a [[sling]] and some [[flint stone]]s; a [[dwarvish cloak]] ({{frac|10}} chance); and a {{frac|10}} chance for any armor they generate with to be made into [[mithril]] [[elven chain mail]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L1277 EvilHack 0.7.0 src/makemon.c, line 1277]</ref> They will also receive some [[gold]], with an additional {{frac|8}} chance of receiving a [[lock pick]] and a separate {{frac|6}} chance of getting a [[sack]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L1297 EvilHack 0.7.0 src/makemon.c, line 1297]</ref>

Hobbit pickpockets may occasionally generate as peaceful towards a [[hobbit (starting race)|hobbit]] player, as well as any [[chaotic]] or [[unaligned]] player character.

==Strategy==
Hobbit pickpockets are slightly tougher than the standard hobbit, and their chance to carry a sling and flint stones makes them somewhat dangerous for early game [[Giant (starting race)|giants]]. However, they are not much more difficult to defeat - a giant in particular can easily flatten one with a thrown [[boulder]].

Hobbit pickpockets are a good early source of unlocking tools and containers for most players.

The '''ice nymph''', {{brightcyan|n}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]].

Eating ice nymph meat adds 6% of [[cold resistance]] and can possibly convey the [[teleportitis]] intrinsic.

==Generation==
Ice nymphs are only generated in the [[Ice Queen's Realm]] and [[Geryon's Lair]].

==Strategy==
Ice nymphs are barely much different from other [[nymph]]s, save for being cold-resistant and having slightly lower base experience - they can still pose a threat to you by stealing vital items as usual. This can become especially dire if you are relying on an external source of cold resistance (e.g. [[armor]] or a [[ring of cold resistance|ring]]) to safely traverse the Ice Queen's Realm, or else end up charmed into disrobing during a fight with [[Geryon]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
A female creature from Roman and Greek mythology, the nymph occupied rivers, forests, ponds, etc.  A nymph's beauty is beyond words:  an ever-young woman with sleek figure and long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips and gentle eyes.  A nymph's scent is delightful, and her long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence.  A nymph's demeanour is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty.
                                []

Theseus felt her voice pulling him down into fathoms of sleep.	The song was the skeleton of his dream, and the dream was full of terror.  Demon girls were after him, and a bull-man was goring him.  Everywhere there was blood.  There was pain.  There was fear.	But his head was in the nymph's lap and her musk was about him, her voice weaving the dream.  He knew then that she had been sent to tell him of something dreadful that was to happen to him later.  Her song was a warning.  But she had brought him a new kind of joy, one that made him see everything differently.  The boy, who was to become a hero, suddenly knew then what most heroes learn later -- and some too late -- that joy blots suffering and that the road to nymphs is beset by monsters.

Like normal [[cloud]]s, they block line of sight while allowing [[you]], other monsters, projectiles and spells to pass through them unobstructed. However, poison clouds are much more dangerous to actually walk into.

The area covered by a poison cloud is represented by {{brightgreen|#}}[[Image:Cloud.png]], which is the symbol also used for normal clouds - however, clouds remain visible on-screen even while you are [[blind]], while poison clouds are only displayed when actually in your line of sight.

==Generation==
Poison clouds occur naturally in the [[Plane of Fire]], where the lava produces plumes of poison gas intermittently.

Poison clouds can also be created through the following methods:

* The poison [[breath]] weapon of a [[green dragon]], an [[iron golem]], or a randomly selected breath attack from the [[Chromatic Dragon]] 
* A read [[scroll of stinking cloud]]

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|[[Hezrous]] now leave poisonous clouds as they move. Per {{commit|4b525374d039420916be2f002f5d32a98c046996|commit 4b52537}}, [[vrock]]s can now emit a plume of poison clouds when fleeing, similar to the scroll of stinking cloud.}}

==Description==
Poison clouds obstruct vision from the outside, and being caught within one is much worse - walking through them renders you blind and inflicts steady damage each turn you remain inside, eventually killing you unless you can make you way out. Monsters are subjected to those same effects, taking damage unless they are [[nonliving]] or [[unbreathing]], and monsters with eyes are [[blind]]ed - possessing [[poison resistance]] will prevent you or a monster taking any damage, but the gas will still blind and induce coughing regardless.{{refsrc|src/region.c|971|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
While you will generally encounter a source of poison resistance far before you have to deal with poison clouds, they can still leave you blinded, which can be a hassle unless you have a means to cure it and/or a way to maintain sight of hostile monsters, such as [[telepathy]] or [[warning]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Wearing a [[wet]] [[towel]] halves damage from poison gas clouds and breath.}}

==History==
Poison clouds were introduced with the scroll of stinking cloud in [[NetHack 3.3.0]].

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], poison clouds are subject to some [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3|now-fixed bugs]]:

* Monsters affected by stinking clouds always get angry at you, even if you did not create the cloud. The is bug C341-1 and was declared fixed in January 2004; 3.4.3 had mostly fixed the bug, with the minor exception that it would still occur if loading a bones file from an older game in the 3.4 series.
* The display of stinking clouds on the map may be incorrect when wearing the [[Eyes of the Overworld]]. This is bug C343-213 and was fixed on September 21, 2006.
* The [[invulnerability]] granted from a successful [[prayer]] does not prevent damage from poison clouds; this is bug #H2645 according to the commit that fixed it (0add5217), and the fix was made in 2012.

==Messages==
{{message|Something is burning your <lungs>! You cough and spit blood!|You are affected by a poison cloud and do not have poison resistance.}}
{{message|You cough.|As above, but you are poison resistant and take no damage from the poison cloud.}}
{{message|Your eyes sting!|You were blinded by the poison cloud.}}
{{message|<monster> coughs!|A breathing, living monster is affected by the stinking cloud. This message is printed regardless of whether or not they possess poison resistance.}}

==Variants==
The [[Itlachiayaque]] patch, which replaces the [[Archeologist]] [[quest artifact]] with Itlachiayaque and is implemented in some form in many variants, can be #[[invoked]] to create a targeted, seven-tile diameter poison cloud, similar to a blessed scroll of stinking cloud.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], [[dungeon fern]] spores primarily attack by exploding into small poison clouds, which can sometimes be avoided by standing diagonally to them. Dungeon ferns and their sprouts can create these spores, as does reading a blessed scroll of stinking cloud while [[confused]]. A [[bag of tricks]] also has a {{frac|40}} chance to produce a posion cloud when [[applied]].

[[Cthulhu]] will disintegrate into a mass of poison clouds when defeated, but will reform again after a short amount of turns.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], hezrous now leave poisonous clouds as they move, reflecting their encyclopedia entry. Stinking clouds created by reading a scroll no longer use a predefined rhombus shape, and instead expand from their origin point to fit the terrain. This makes them even more dangerous in closed spaces.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the lair of [[Lolth]] has permanent poison clouds that lack gravity or a floor; a character that enters them will be subject to the same movement rules as on the [[Plane of Air]].

More monsters utilize poison clouds as well:

* The [[poison gas]] mage spell used by Cuprilach [[Rilmani]] creates clouds of poison gas.
* [[Yochlol]]s can transform into a [[vortex]] form called a "stinking cloud", which has an [[engulf]]ing attack with the same effects as regular poison clouds.
* [[Changed]] that fall below 1/2 HP will stop restoring health naturally and begin releasing small poison clouds while losing 1 HP per turn - this ensures it will eventually die, which produces a large cloud of poison.
* As in UnNetHack, Cthulhu will disintegrate into a mass of poison clouds if defeated, but reforms after a short amount of turns.

===GruntHack===
[[GruntHack]] fixes the 3.4.3 prayer-related bug that did not prevent damage from poison clouds.

===DynaHack===
In [[DynaHack]], the bag of tricks works as it does in UnNetHack, including the chance of producing poison clouds on application.

Madmen may be any race except for [[Chiropteran]]. They may be any alignment to start.

==Starting inventory==
*[[cursed]] [[straitjacket]]
*uncursed blindfold (this can be put on and remove via apply even while stuck in the jacket, and madmen begin with intrinsic telepathy).
*2 uncursed potions of booze or two potions of human blood as a vampire.

The cursed straitjacket prevents the use of the hands, with the same basic effects as a [[Two-handed#Strategy|cursed two-handed weapon]]. Worse, the jacket prevents melee attacks with the hands. The Madman will [[kick]] as their default attack.

Further, Madmen have a summon-able [[secret whisperer]] instead of a normal pet.

==Psychic powers==

Madmen can use [[mind blast]] for 10 power, and can summon their secret whisperer, initially at a cost of 10 power (this cost increases as your [[insight]] increases).
*The mind blast can be used to thin crowds of enemies from across the map, but this is not reliable. The blasts are very reliable vs. mind flayers, and pretty reliable vs. other psychic monsters.
*The secret whisperer initially has no attacks and is quite fragile. Its primary purpose is to buff the Madman ("whispers dire secrets, filling you with zeal"), increasing their to-hit and damage. Enemies will also still attack the whisperer in preference to the PC, so it can be used to absorb a blow or two. It's typically important to summon the whisperer before a battle begins, since it costs a turn and needs to be out for a round before buffing you. The whisperer gains one level per point of [[insight]] you gain.
**Every time the secret whisperer buffs you, both [[wisdom]] and [[intelligence]] are [[exercise]]d. This is one of the only ways to exercise intelligence.

==Intrinsics==
Madmen gain intrinsics at these [[experience level]]s:

*XL 1: [[Telepathy]]
*XL 7: [[Searching]]
*XL 15: [[Warning]]
*XL 30: [[Clairvoyance]]

Madmen start with no skills learned.

Madmen use charisma as their spellcasting stat.

==Quest==
The [[madman quest]] sees you fighting [[Doctor Archer]] for [[the Star of Hypernotus]], a amulet versus curses that protects against [[confusion]], [[stun]]ning, [[sanity]], and [[madness]] effects when carried.

==Gods==
{{wikipedia|The Doom That Came to Sarnath}}
{{main|Religion}}
* Lawful: Lobon
* Neutral: Tamash
* Chaotic: Zo-Kalar

*Non-aligned: Bokrug, the water-lizard

The Madman pantheon is made up of deities worshiped by the inhabitants of Sarnath in the H.P. Lovecraft story "The Doom That Came to Sarnath." They have the option to switch to the unaligned Bokrug after they complete their quest.

===Crowning gifts===

===Water-damaged scroll===

{{stub}}

==Rank titles==
The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1-2: Ward
*XL 3-5: Escapee
*XL 6-9: Drifter
*XL 10-13: Derelict
*XL 14-17: Raver
*XL 18-21: Lunatic
*XL 22-25: Maniac
*XL 26-29: Augur
*XL 30: Seer

==Strategy==

Madmen start the game stuck in a [[straitjacket]], with a negative [[alignment record]], and an [[Anger|angry god]]. Vampiric madmen also start the game [[punished]].
*The jacket prevents the use of the hands (even in combat), so the Madman must get free from the jacket before being able to improve their offensive or defensive abilities. See the [[straitjacket]] article for suggestions on how to get free.
**The jacket forces Madmen to kick down doors in order to pass through them. Use the starting blindfold to make sure you aren't about to kick down a shop door!
*Your god's anger and your negative alignment record prevents prayer. 
**It will be at least 800 turns before you can increase your alignment record to 1.
**If you can fix the anger, you will be able to pray for aid once your alignment record is positive.

&&%s&& %s Straitjacket {141008 2021-06-17T22:25:43Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Escaping a cursed straitjacket */ Links The '''straitjacket''' ("long-sleeved jacket") is a type of torso "armor" that appears in [[dNetHack]].

== Use as armor ==

As armor, the straitjacket (unusually for armor in the torso slot) protects the upper body and arms. It provides MC 2 and no extrinsic.

However, a straitjacket should never actually be used as armor, due to the risk of becoming trapped in the armor should it become cursed.

== Effects of a cursed straitjacket ==

A cursed straitjacket prevents the use of the hands, acting as if your hands were welded to a [[Two-handed#Strategy|cursed two-handed weapon]], notably preventing donning and doffing armor, opening doors, and casting spells. Additionally, a cursed jacket prevents any attack that uses the upper limbs, notably including the player-character's default melee attack. While stuck in a jacket, the PC will fall back on their [[kick]] attack if possible, becoming completely unable to attack if their kick attack is somehow blocked (such as by standing in shallow water).

== Escaping a cursed straitjacket ==

Because the jacket is stuck to itself, weld-proof-ness offers no protection against a cursed straitjacket. There are, however, numerous methods of escape. Some more frequent methods are as follows (see [[curse removal]] for a complete list):
* Prayer. The gods recognize being stuck in a jacket as a major [[trouble]], and so are quite likely to free you (note that [[Madman (dNetHack role)|Madmen]], who start the game stuck in a jacket, also start with [[anger|angry]] gods!).
* A scroll of remove curse or an [[effigy]] will lift the curse and allow escape.
* A scroll of destroy armor will destroy the jacket as normal.
* Shopkeepers sometimes offer curse removal as a [[Shopkeeper_services|shop service]]. Gaining access to a shop may require waiting for an intelligent monster to open the door for you!
* Allowing the jacket to be stolen by a [[nymph]] (amusingly, the nymph may proceed to trap herself in the jacket, preventing further theft attacks!).
* Allowing the jacket to be removed by a [[foocubus]].
* Polymorphing to a form that breaks or shrinks out of the jacket.
* A [[magic trap]] may uncurse the jacket (4.8% chance).

'''Hellish seals''' (also commonly referred to as '''hell vaults''') are a [[dungeon feature]] added in [[dNetHack]]. Being a feature of the floor, they do not block line of sight or otherwise obstruct the square. Indeed, the only way to interact with a hellish seal is to break it by [[digging]] downwards over the seal.

Hellish seals are generated as part of random level generation in random [[gehennom]] mazes. They are generated in small, closed 3x3 rooms found within larger rooms. A specific monster is sealed away within each hellish seal. The precise monster type can only be learned by breaking the seal, but the broad category can be learned by observing the statue placed on top of the seal.

Each hellish seal also contains a metallic chest containing between 9 and 36 (9d4) random magical items. Approximately 1/3rd of these items will be armor, 1/3rd of them will be weapons, and the remaining 1/3rd will be random magic items. Armor and weapons may be highly enchanted, may generate as [[artifact]]s, and may generate with [[object properties]]. It will likely be necessary to dig the chest out of the ground beneath the seal. The chest is always locked and trapped.

'''Akkabish tanninim''' are a possible inhabitant of a strange-larva-[[hellish seal]]. They are not particularly threatening one-on-one, but their sting attacks can snowball if they are not dispatched quickly.

==Implant egg attack==

Each melee sting delivered by the tannin implants an egg into the target that will eventually hatch into a '''strange larva'''. Strange larvae are non-threatening, but they quickly grow into a pre-set monster type-in this case, another akkabish tannin. Since an akkabish has six of these sting attacks and is able to make a full round of attacks twice per turn, this can quickly get out of hand.

==Formication madness==

While afflicted with '''formication''' (the feeling of insects crawling over your body) the character will suffer from reduced skill levels (-1 skill level per 20 points of lost sanity) and increased spell failure (1 percentage point per 2 points of lost sanity). In addition, the character will randomly awaken from [[sleep]] (normally, this is a slight advantage, but for [[android]] characters it is a huge disadvantage).

==Origin==

'''Tannin''' (plural '''tanninim''') is an ancient Hebrew word meaning "sea monster" (or sometimes "serpent," and sometimes translated as "dragon"). Ancient Semitic religions used sea monsters to symbolize primordial chaos, and sometimes evil (see also '''Tiamat'''/[[the Chromatic Dragon]]).

'''Akkabish''' is a Hebrew word meaning "spider."

dNetHack's tanninim are based on D&D [https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Obyrith Obyrith] and Pathfinder [https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/qlippoth/ Qlippoth]. Akkabish tanninim are based on Ekolid Obyrith.

'''Shalosh tannoth''' are a possible inhabitant of a strange-larva-[[hellish seal]]. They are not particularly threatening one-on-one, though they can become somewhat threatening if allowed to build up an army of offspring.

==Flesh hook attack==

The tannah's primary attack traps the target in a '''flesh hook''', which restricts movement much like a [[bear trap]]. Flesh hooks can immobilize flying targets as well as grounded ones.

==Demon offspring==

Each turn, a shalosh may (1/9th chance) produce 1-3 '''strange larvae''' in adjacent squares. These larvae will quickly grow into either [[vrock]]s, [[hezrou]], [[nalfeshnee]]s, or [[marilith]]s, complete with appropriate (organic) equipment. Because these larvae do not grow into more shalosh, there is little danger of the situation snowballing out of control; however, it is still wise to quickly kill the shalosh.

==Host madness==

The character becomes convinced that their body is playing host to some sort of large parasite. They will periodically become [[Nauseated]] as a result, and have their [[Dexterity]] temporarily reduced to 3.

==Origin==

'''Tannin''' (plural '''tanninim''') is an ancient Hebrew word meaning "sea monster" (or sometimes "serpent," and sometimes translated as "dragon"). Ancient Semitic religions used sea monsters to symbolize primordial chaos, and sometimes evil (see also '''Tiamat'''/[[the Chromatic Dragon]].

The etymology of '''tannah''' is a bit less clear, however, it seems to be the feminine form of tan ("jackal"). It appears to symbolize desolation, loneliness, and abandoned places. English-language sources tend to claim that it means "dragon" and is the feminine form of tannin, but this appears to be a mistranslation. Regardless, dNetHack uses the word as though it ''were'' the feminine form of tannin.

'''Shalosh''' is a Hebrew word meaning "three."
