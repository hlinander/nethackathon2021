===Copyright-orphan spoilers===

There are many spoilers available which carry no copyright notice, but the copyright of these still lies with their authors. It might be said that the voluntary public distribution of these documents is an implied license which grants the freedoms necessary for us to include these works in this wiki. We do so in good faith by using the {{tl|basedon}} template, which looks like this:

== Watchlists missing on new wiki ==

If you just came here from Wikia, you may have noticed that [[Special:Watchlist|your watchlist]] is empty.  Apparently, the [[mw:Extension:MediaWikiAuth|MediaWikiAuth extension]] doesn't import it automatically.  However, you can fix the problem easily:

# Go to [http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Watchlist/raw Special:Watchlist/raw at Wikia].  If you're logged in, you should see a textbox listing the contents of your watchlist on the old wiki.  Select it all and copy it to your clipboard.
# Go to [[Special:Watchlist/raw|the corresponding page]] on the new wiki and paste in what you just copied.  Then click "{{int:watchlistedit-raw-submit}}".

Happy hacking!  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 01:08, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

PS. It looks like user preferences don't get imported either, even though [[mw:Extension:MediaWikiAuth|the documentation]] says they should be.  Alas, I know of no such easy shortcut to fixing that.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 01:18, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

== We need a new logo ==

[[File:Nethackwiki-logo.png|thumb|132px|Logo suggestion by [[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]]]]
Since we're no longer at Wikia, the [[:File:Wiki.png|current logo]] (which spells "wiki@") seems a bit inappropriate.  We should pick a new one.  To kick things off, here's [[:File:Nethackwiki-logo.png|my quick suggestion]] based on the old idea (monsters spelling out the name of the site).  There's also an [[:File:Nethackwiki-logo.svg|SVG version]], <s>although the SVG renderer here makes an awful mess of it</s>.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 02:12, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

I'm growing a bit wary of administrivia. Feel free to beat me to the task.[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 15:19, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

== Unified login (in the remote future) ==

Each of several major NetHack sites has its own user namespace (this wiki, the old wiki, NAO, freenode, NAO forums, other gameservers). In a long term perspective, some form of unified login would be great. Users would benefit from less signup hassle (and less chance of impersonation). For the wiki, it's a great marketing ploy. Especially as we're competing against ourselves at Wikia. Silly as it seems, each signup act drives away visitors.

I realize this is pie-in-the-sky right now, and we have more pressing chores due to The Move.

Colliding usernames will make unified login difficult. We could let Wikiuser play as w:Wikiuser, and Naoplayer edit as n:Naoplayer until people can merge their accounts themselves. Freenode requires some thought. As a first step, I propose adding a warning "You are about to create a username that already exists on NAO/the wiki/freenode/... Please consider choosing a different name unless you are the same person."

See also: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Unified_login

:<s>The [[mw:Extension:CentralAuth|CentralAuth extension]], which Wikimedia uses, has been designed to address just those username collision issues.  (That's why it's so complicated; if starting from scratch, it would be much easier to just share the user table between wikis.)  However, it's been designed with the assumption that all the wikis are running on the same server(s).  I haven't really looked at the code to see if there might be any way to relax that assumption.</s>  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 21:29, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
::Ah, scratch that, I misread what the issue was.  Still, looking at how CentralAuth handles username conflicts ''might'' be useful.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 21:31, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

{{resolved top}}
== Announcing edits on IRC? ==

MediaWiki can be set up to [[mw:Manual:IRC RC Bot|report edits on IRC]].  It would be kind of nice to have [[Rodney (bot)|Rodney]] announce whenever someone edits the wiki, although some checks would probably have to be set up to avoid flooding the channel if someone makes lots of edits in a short time.  (Just having it not report edits marked as minor might be a good start.)  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 21:53, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

:Please try it out. The usage data will be valueable, if nothing else. (Personally, I'm too old-fashioned to find value in Twitter.)
:Speaking from RSS/Atom experience, [[Special:RecentChanges]] isn't the right thing to broadcast - too much traffic. At the very least, offer some filtering. E.g. keywords: I expect a Crawl person will want to follow all Crawl-related changes, and so on. [[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 15:17, 13 November 2010 (UTC)
::[[Rodney (bot)|Rodney]] will now announce edits in #nethackwiki. --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 18:23, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
{{resolved bottom}}

== Google and optimization ==

Google was by far the largest source of traffic to the old site, so our Google ranking is very important. How can we raise it?

* '''Original and fresh content.''' When two sites offer identical content, one of them is downranked as copycat. We need to be different from Wikia, and we should offer Googlebot fresh stuff. Can we please have something like [[Special:AncientPages]], except that it shows only pages that have not been modified since Google spidered it, with (by humans) most visited pages sorted first?

* <s>Why did our main page see 1722 hits already, but all other articles go virtually unread? The page view counts were much closer on the old wiki. [[Special:PopularPages]], [[w:c:nethack:Special:Mostvisitedpages]].</s> I propose adding a box to our main page that explains briefly what NetHack is, aimed at people stumbling into the wiki.

--[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 22:03, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

:The special page idea sounds interesting.  I suspect one reason for the main page being so far ahead here is that all the move announcements link to it.  People get curious, click the link, go "oh, it's just like the old wiki, just a different skin" and leave.  Things ought to even out once the idly curious folks are replaced by people actually interested in looking something up.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 22:26, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

:<s>BTW, I ''think'' the reason [[-]] ranks so high is because MediaWiki uses it as a dummy page name for loading some site JS and CSS code.  Although the fact that those hits get counted at all could be considered a bug.  (At least, I hope that's it.  The other possibility is that there are some broken links somewhere actually sending people to that page.)  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 22:32, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
::There ''are'' broken links, see above near http://domain/article. [[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 22:40, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
:::Just to make it clear: Those broken links have been taken care of. Also: [[-]] is indeed used as a dummy page name by MW. --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 15:22, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

:''Don't Panic!'' Most of the visitors right now are those who already know the wiki, but have seen the move announcement in RGRN, LJ, whatever. They just pop in, put the new link in their bookmarks, and go on with their lives. --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 07:37, 12 November 2010 (UTC)</s>

::{{moon phase}} Agreed.  It does suggest the possibility that a well timed main page redesign might encourage those visitors to look around a bit more.  We might as well do it anyway, seeing as the current design was optimized for Wikia.  One idea I had was that we might borrow the idea of a [[wikipedia:WP:DYK|Did you know?]] section from Wikipedia (probably starting off without any age or length limits, basically just a regularly updated list of curious NetHack trivia).  It shouldn't be hard to manage, and should serve as a nice hook to lure casual visitors in.

::Ps. I already made some small tweaks to the main page, including greeting logged-in users by name and notifying them of full/new moon like the game does.  I also wrote a quick little [[Template:Moon phase|template]] for displaying moon phases like NAO does (although my version so far only has one image for each of the 8 phases nethack uses internally).  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 08:25, 12 November 2010 (UTC)
::Moon phase does not show up for me.[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 17:14, 12 November 2010 (UTC)
:::You mean on the main page or at [[Template:Moon phase]]?  The version I [{{fullurl:Main_Page|diff=56298&oldid=54072}} put on the main page] only says anything when the moon is new or full, just like in the game.  I was thinking of putting (something like) {{[[template:moon phase|moon phase]]}} on the main page too, but hadn't got around to the that yet. --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 19:32, 13 November 2010 (UTC)

* '''rel="nofollow"'''. I changed most high-ranking incoming links, but virtually all wikis make external links useless. This is the reason for our abysmal Google rank. (Forums fare better.) The only solution I can see is to ask the respective admins to add us to their interwiki table, and then to make those links interwiki links. Of course, we have to link to them with a "good" link first... --[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 03:51, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
:: The [[User:Tjr/incoming_links|list of incoming links]]. Admins go to "view deleted". Our former wikihost should not see this.

**<s>Robots.txt needs a sitemap: "Sitemap: http://nethackwiki.com/sitemap.xml"

== Source code syntax highlighting? ==

As we can now highlight syntax for several programming languages (Thanks to an [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi extension] using [http://qbnz.com/highlighter/ geshi]), should we change the source code pages to use that? For a short test, see [[User:Paxed/src geshi test]]. --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 08:48, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

:Yes.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 10:02, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

How would we link to the function definitions in the source files? Geshi only knows the function name, so the links would have to be something like [[Source:invent.c#feel_cockatrice|http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Src/feel_cockatrice]], which would redirect to the correct place in the Source namespace. I already have a list of the functions at [[User:Paxed/Source Functions]], but what would be best format for the function redirects? [[Source/function_name]], or [[Src/nh343/function_name]] or what? --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 17:35, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

:You mean the text the human user will see? Why not <nowiki>[[Src/feel_cockatrice]]</nowiki>? BTW, your list of source functions is incomplete, and macros are excluded entirely. ---[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 20:32, 18 November 2010 (UTC)
::Yes, I know it's incomplete, it's automatically generated from the src-directory, and macros aren't as easy. --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 20:50, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

:BTW, I wonder if it would be better to keep the line numbers hardcoded and somehow kluge GeSHi to skip over them?

:::I can replicate the bug if I change the style <code>#line .de1, #line .de2 { font: 1em/1.2em monospace; }</code> to <code>font: 1em/1em monospace;</code>.  This causes the lowest few pixels of all characters to be cut off, making underscores look like spaces.  Perhaps on your browser even the 1.2em line height isn't enough?  It might be safer to set the line height to something larger, say 1.4em or more, and, if desired, use negative margins to tighten up the line spacing instead.  (For example, <code>#line .de1, #line .de2 { font: 1em/2em monospace; margin: -0.8em 0; }</code> looks identical to the current style for me, but avoids any risk of characters being cut off.)  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 09:55, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

== Site name "NetHack Wiki" or "NetHackWiki", important for Google search ==

People overwhelmingly search for "nethack" or "nethack wiki", and don't find us. Google has us keyworded and well-ranked for "nethackwiki". There seems to be no connection between "nethackwiki" and either "nethack wiki" or "nethack". (I'm sorry, I was not aware of this disconnect ahead of time.) This is a real problem because Google was the main referrer on the old wiki.

Monthly searches on Google: 60,500 for "nethack", 165,000 for "net+hack", 2,900 for "nethack+wiki", surprisingly same for "wikihack", negligible for "nethackwiki". [https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&__c=1000000000&ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none Source]

Our keywords are, as reported by Google Webmaster Tools: nethackwiki 100%, edit 63%, nethack 36%, monster 35%, navigate 33%, search 31%.

The goal is to make us relevant for "nethack", and for "nethack+wiki".

IMHO things can still be fixed at this time, and should be. Global on-site replacement is easy with [[Special:ReplaceText]]. I can edit the various other wikis myself. Most visitors won't even notice. But I would hate to annoy those helpful individuals who switched external links with another requested change. (Not very many have done so using NetHackWiki as anchor text.) I don't know how bad the mis-match between link anchor text + domain "nethackwiki" versus page title + contents "nethack wiki" is.

What are your opinions? --[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 14:45, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

:1) "net+hack" we can ignore, they're not looking for us. "nethackwiki" doesn't get more searches because there hasn't been a "nethackwiki". (the old site was called "wikihack", remember?) I'm sure "nethackwiki" will get more searches in the future when people realize that's our name. IMO, using extra spaces will just annoy, maybe create problems/annoyances with some things (category rename, text renames, etc). And most of the links that link to us from reputable roguelike sites will be either "NetHackWiki" or "NetHack Wiki", so eventually google will start ranking us higher than the old site. (domain name match!) --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 14:54, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

== Let's audit advice ==

The wiki seems to contain a lot of bad advice. Most of its bad reputation is due to that. Advice should make clear its assumptions on player skill, conducts, and available in-game resources.

Let's audit all pages for junk.

I suggest starting with [[special:popularpages]], and adding <nowiki>[[Category:AdviceAuditedBy|YourUsername]]</nowiki> to pages that you have checked.

Thoughts? Better ideas? --[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 00:50, 29 November 2010 (UTC)

:::Not in stock MediaWiki, but I think the [[mw:Extension:DynamicPageList (Wikimedia)|DynamicPageList extension]] should let you do that.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 13:16, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

:While I think it's a great idea for us to have a concerted effort to audit advice found in this wiki, I don't think it's a good idea to have a "Audited by user X" sticker prominently shown on the page, since that has very little meaning to a reader unless he knows exactly who user X is and trusts his opinion. Also, anybody can change that advice, making that "audited sticker" practically worthless once the advice has changed. Of course, the reader can look at the history and see what changes have been made to the advice since it was lasted audited, but he might as well just go back and see who originally wrote the advice if he's going to bother looking that deep into the history of the article.

:IMO, a more low profile list of who audited what that is mainly visible only to the auditors would be a better way of organizing this effort, since it would reduce the chance of the readers having a false confidence in the advice given in the audited article. A simpler way of saying it: Even though an article has been audited, it's still an article on a wiki.

== Talk page signature checker ==

I've added a script to warn users if they edit a [[Help:talk page|talk page]] or a forum without signing their edit with <code>--~~<nowiki>~~</nowiki></code>.  You may need to [[wikipedia:WP:BYPASS|clear your cache]] before it starts working.  Logged-in users can turn it off in their [[Special:preferences|preferences]] (under "Gadgets") if they find it more annoying than useful.  Any feedback or bug reports are very much appreciated.

One known bug is that the script doesn't work on pages in the {{ns:Project}} namespace, such as here on the Community Portal.  The problem is that this namespace contains both discussion and content pages, and it's not trivial to tell them apart.  One possible solution would be to simply hardcode a list of pages that should be treated as talk pages.  A better one might be to query the MediaWiki API to tell if the page contains <nowiki>__NEWSECTIONLINK__</nowiki>. --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 22:01, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

== Renaming the old site back to Wikihack ==

I've thought about it again, and I think Bhaak is right. It's too confusing to have two identically branded sites. And I'm not sure if renaming it to anything else except Wikihack wouldn't get reverted. My original motivation why I introduced NetHackWiki was to gently prepare readers for the move, without really thinking through what would happen if Google kept ranking the old site first. With the move notices gone, this point is moot now.

We can't win the fight for the keyword "wikihack" anyway. (We're on position 58.) Let's win "nethackwiki". --[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 03:28, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

I didn't have any particular reason for picking it, except that it happened to be the nicest looking monospaced font I had installed.  (Also, the colors I used are a bit different from the standard CGA colors used in the site CSS; you can see them on the third line of [[User:Ilmari Karonen/Color schemes|this page]].  In particular, I made the yellow in the logo fairly dark so that the {{yellow|c}} wouldn't stand out too much, and brightened the blue to make the {{blue|e}} more visible.)

:::::As for the proposed logos, I think both the original design and ZeroOne's new version are nice.

== People have trouble with our captchas ==

Reading [[s:w:awa:Talk:Moved_wikis#wikis_which_need_to_maybe_reconsider_login_procedures]], it seems a reasonable fraction of all visitors have problems with the captchas.

== Standard format for the "Messages" section. ==

I've noticed a variety of different formats used for lists nethack messages, but haven't found standard format. Is there a standard format that I have missed? If not, is there a good place to discuss this issue?

Most places where I've seen messages being listed, they are usually in a table or "definition list" type of format, both of which are, IMO, interchangeable without losing any information or ease of use. I prefer the "definition list" way of doing it, since it appears to be a little more flexible, the messages stand out more and there is space for a bigger description of the message. 

Also would there be any benefit for using templates to list individual messages? Not only would that allow for a standard representation of messages, it could also allow for easily cross-referencing messages that appear on multiple pages or some other type of automated features with messages. IMO, it would be nice to have a since source for messages dedicated to listing all types of messages and fully explaining them. And then having other pages referring to those messages to prevent unnecessary duplication.

--[[User:Dptr1988|Dptr1988]] 20:54, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, a standard format for messages would be nice.  I also like the definition list format, even if it has some minor disadvantages (like the fact that colons in messages can mess it up unless encoded).  It would also be nice if we could automatically generate anchors for messages (like MediaWiki generates for section headings) so that one could link to them; I suppose a template could be made to do that.  I could look into it a bit later.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 09:51, 25 December 2010 (UTC)

The [http://www.seomad.com/SEOBlog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/organic-CTR.jpg market average CTR] in these positions ranges from 13% to 7%.

That means there is a lot of room for improvement, and we need to do some testing and tuning. What do you suggest to put in [[MediaWiki:Description]] and [[MediaWiki:Pagetitle-view-mainpage]]? --[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 00:18, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

:I have a suspicion that the main page title, while possibly helpful for our ranking, may also be hurting our click-through rate precisely because it looks like the kind of "keyword spam" that people have learned to semi-consciously ignore.

Maybe we can fix it so it can use some of the hooks from the [[Project:Did you know?]] page, and some generic rumors that aren't too big on spoilers from the oracle. Not only would it bring a fresh change to recurring visitors, but it will hopefully spark the curiosity in the wiki/game from new visitors as well.

== Role articles ==

I know this has been said for a while, but the role articles could use some substantial work. They're not ''bad'' as they are, but they could be a lot more useful.

In particular, the Strategy section should be split into a couple sections, like Early Game, Midgame, and Late Game. Each section should consider things like weapon choice, general gameplay, and so on.

Should quest information be discussed on the role page, the quest page, or the quest nemesis page? I think we have some of each right now. The others should just link to there.

Other ideas? If we agree on what to actually do, I'd be willing to do some restructuring work.
[[User:Scorchgeek|Scorchgeek]] ([[User talk:Scorchgeek|talk]]) 01:23, 1 November 2012 (UTC)

:I think that's a good idea. (The sections might be named "Early '''g'''ame" etc. though for capitalization consistent with the other parts of the wiki.) Strategy can vary quite much between different stages of the game, obviously.
:On quest information - I think it'd make sense for nemesis-specific information to be on the nemesis page, perhaps with a short note on the quest page. Other quest information ("there are many [[vampire bat]]s in the wizard quest", etc.) should be on the main quest page. The role page might mention the quest (something similar to [[Wizard#Quest]], maybe with a note about its difficulty), using {{tl|main}} to link to the quest page for the role in case readers want to know more things about the quest (thus keeping duplication of content to a minimum while still giving the most basic information).
:The strategy sections should probably mention when to do the quest, too, though details about ''how'' to do it are probably best placed on the quest page (or nemesis page in the case of nemesis strategy). This can then be linked to.
:In some cases, the Strategy sections might need to mention different strategies; I don't think we should only specify one of them, especially in cases where all of them are rather common (I'm thinking mostly of [[wizard]]s here &ndash; some people prefer using metal armor early and throwing [[dagger]]s while others try not to use metal armor at all, instead preferring high [[spellcasting]] success rates for all of the game).

== Handling monster color changes in UnNetHack ==

Version 5.0 of UnNetHack changes color of multiple monsters ([https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unnethack/changeset/1455 r1455]). My suggested method of handling this in monsym templates is to it like it is done with Cthulhu (different symbols in UnNetHack and SLASH'EM)
* Create templates for variants ([[Template:Monsym/master mind flayer (UnNetHack)]] and [[Template:Monsym/master mind flayer (vanilla)]])
* replace [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Monsym/master_mind_flayer|Template:Monsym/master mind flayer]] by proper one (or maybe leave multivariant one)
* modify [[Template:Monsym/master mind flayer]] to look like [[Template:Monsym/Cthulhu]] (displays both possibilities)

Is there anybody with a better method of handling this change? Second question - when this mass edit should be done? UnNetHack 5.0 will be used during Junethack and released after tournament [[User:Bulwersator|Bulwersator]] ([[User talk:Bulwersator|talk]]) 15:32, 29 May 2013 (UTC)

:I think something like [[Template:Monsym/master mind flayer/UnNetHack/5.0]] and [[Template:Monsym/master mind flayer/NetHack/3.4.3]] would be even better, actually. That'd involve some work, but it should be not too difficult to automate.
:[[Template:Monsym]] would take a variant parameter and use that variant; it'd also take a version number. I'm not completely sure how to avoid having a duplicated page for ''every'' version released, but there's probably some way I could think of.
:Something like [[mw:Extension:Variables]] would help avoid specifying all the parameters everytime [[Template:Monsym]] is used on a page. Perhaps it could be combined with a modification of the templates suggested on [[NetHackWiki:Next version]], too: have a template that marks individual sections as specific to e.g. UnNetHack 5.0 or vanilla 3.4.3, then have that automatically set the variable.

== Medica Ossium ==

Hey.

I didn't find a way to send a message to someone who could help, so I'm gonna write here. Sorry for that.

I'm here just to tell you I find a creature who wasn't cataloged in this website. I tried to create a new page for it myself, but I've failed.

The creature is named "medica ossium" (same name of the healer's rank).

"Status of the medica ossium (neutral): Level 14    HP 65(65)   AC 10."
 
I took a couple of screenshots of it.

== New page please: Command line arguments ==

Uh-oh! The Style Guide says not to create a missing page and just stick {-{stub}-} in it. I'm real busy this week ... maybe someone else has time to put the command line arguments supported by the NetHack binary into Wiki-ese?

== Tiles ==

I've noticed that a lot of people have been able to upload tiles, but they're only available in the source code as the little "color by letter" 16x16 squares. How would I go about getting the tiles for the defunct quest monsters for the SLASH'EM racial quests onto the wiki? --[[User:Kahran042|Kahran042]] ([[User talk:Kahran042|talk]]) 13:09, 18 June 2015 (UTC)

== This page may need to be updated for NetHack 3.6.0 ==

on a page which has one of these 3.6 banners how do i show that i have checked one of the links to the source?

i cant remove the 3.6 banner because i havent checked them all but i'd like to indicate to others that they dont have to check this particular link.

any ideas?

:Which page? You could always leave a note on the discussion page for starters. [[User:MyNameWasTaken|MyNameWasTaken]] ([[User talk:MyNameWasTaken|talk]]) 22:22, 29 June 2016 (UTC)

::Fenris, thanks for getting involved in the wiki!
::You can update in-text 3.4.3 source code references by opening up the [[NetHack 3.4.3 source code]] to the line number being referenced, finding the corresponding line in the [[NetHack 3.6.0 source code]], opening the page you are working on for editing, and changing the number in the Refsrc template call to the new line number.  The reorganization of the source code has caused some extreme shifts in line numbers, so take a good look at the line's context in the 3.4.3 source before you're sure of the new location.  Sometimes the same subheadings are used in both sources, so looking for the nearest subheading in the 3.4.3 source might help you orient yourself in the 3.6.0 source.  
::To make it clear that the reference is now to version 3.6.0, change the Refsrc template call to match the new "versioned" format, which you can find at [[Template:Refsrc]].  Usually this just means including the name of the folder of the file being referenced (src/allmain.c), and adding the name of the version (version=NetHack 3.6.0).  "Category:Pages with unversioned Refsrc templates" has a list of pages that need to be changed to the new syntax, but be aware that some of these are for pages related to [[patch]]es and [[variant]]s that reference a source code other than 3.6.0.

== Macro implementation: nh 3.6, Windows 10 ==

I'm curious if (and how) there are successful recent implementations of the AutoHotKey macro method described at the Wiki "Macro" page.

In 3.6.0, running under Windows 10, I created the runmeonce and trigger ahk scripts, etc, but there is no NHLauncher.exe executable with which to start nethack in the nh distribution, and within the nethack UI (I tried both the "traditional" and windows graphical versions) CTRL+M does not launch the macro creator interface window.

Any help would be appreciated

== Link to GitHub with [[Template:Refsrc]]? ==

I'd like to propose to amend [[Template:Refsrc]] to point to GitHub for vanilla NetHack source code links, and possibly some variants as well. This will get around the issue of line number anchors not working, and would work for NetHack 3.6.2 until the source is uploaded to the wiki.

[[User:Wooble]] has independently made the same suggestion on [[IRC]] just now.

[[Template:Reffunc]] may not work with this, ''unless'' we write a list mapping function names to source lines and do a similar thing from there. - [[User:Andrio Celos|Andrio Celos]] ([[User talk:Andrio Celos|talk]]) 11:55, 24 May 2019 (UTC)
:How hard (comparatively) would it be to fix the line number anchors? I know they used to work and I don't see that anything has changed, so I was surprised to see them broken all of a sudden.

== Identification section ==

Should pages for items include an "Identification" section?

I tend to add an explicit "Identification" section to item pages with advice for identification. However the "Identification" section I added for [[ring of conflict]] was removed, and all the relevant info was moved to "Strategy", so clearly not all of you feel the same way about this.

I think identification of items is separate from the strategy for using a particular item. A player benefits from identifying every item, even items with no strategic use, if for no other reason than to feel better about throwing them away. It also makes sense for identification to be described before strategy because a player will have to identify items before using them reliably.

Well, that's my take. Anybody else?

--[[User:Aximili|Aximili]] ([[User talk:Aximili|talk]]) 17:02, 21 March 2020 (UTC)

Actually, quick correction, I didn't add an "Identification" section to [[ring of conflict]], I merely moved identification advice from the pre-existing "Strategy" section. --[[User:Aximili|Aximili]] ([[User talk:Aximili|talk]]) 17:05, 21 March 2020 (UTC)

:I think I moved it back precisely ''because'' it just sounded like an extended strategy section more than anything. I'm not at all against the inclusion of separate sections for identification - rather, it's more that I interpret it as a section specifically for stuff like price-ID, autoidentifying, things of that nature. Informal identification CAN be and basically is part of that on paper, but with the ring of conflict, my rationale (which I'dve gladly explained had I been asked directly) was that it's also a vital part of any strategy around it, "it" being "not finding the thing and immediately dying from wear-testing it", such that it was worth noting first in that section. I'm more than willing to rewrite it more to accommodate, and I actually made a couple of edits in that direction - the larger question is more ''how'' to approach that than anything else. --[[User:Umbire the Phantom|Umbire the Phantom]] ([[User talk:Umbire the Phantom|talk]]) 23:28, 22 March 2020 (UTC)

== "What links here" link availability? ==

Hi. For things like fixing [[https://nethackwiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Astaroth&redirect=no this redirect]] so that it does follow wiki style while not creating double redirects, and for multiple other uses, it would be very nice to have readily available (preferably via a left-hand-side menu link, under Tools) the standard wiki "what links here" special page (and the rest of the special pages, for that matter). Is there some setting I need to change for this, or is this something needing correcting by admins? Thanks! -[[User:Actual-nh|Actual-nh]] ([[User talk:Actual-nh|talk]]) 18:05, 6 June 2021 (UTC)

== New NetHack tiles, can someone help with screenshots? ==

Hello.
I just created a new set (2 sets actually) of tiles based on the default and Oryx tilesets. I called them Kinghack, they are located in the Pictographic Tiles section of the Tiles page.
https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Tileset
Can someone add them to the NetHack tileset screenshots (Where one can see the different tilesets in different areas of the game, wall testing, monsters, objects, etc). Or tell me how to add them to that site?

== GetIndie.wiki listing? ==

Would it be appropriate to submit the wiki to GetIndie.Wiki? It's a browser extension that redirects users from Fandom wikis to alternate better maintained wikis.

:I don't see why not.  It doesn't cost us anything and it might be helpful to a few new people who end up on Fandom without realizing that the community moved.

== Live games ==
{{main|Public server}}

The [[nethack.alt.org]] [https://alt.org/nethack public NetHack server] located in California, USA allows you to browse games live as others play them:

 $ telnet nethack.alt.org

A few other servers also run [[dgamelaunch]] and are mostly used by those who find NAO too far away. You can watch games if anyone is playing:
* [http://nostalgia.suroot.com/ Nostalgia Public NetHack Server], Sweden:
 $ telnet nostalgia.suroot.com
* [http://slackwell.com/nethack/ Slackwell.com NetHack server], Indiana, USA:
 $ telnet telnet slackwell.com

* [https://nethack.xd.cm Nethack.xd.cm] public NetHack and other games server
 $ ssh nethack@nethack.xd.cm

If you miss a game on nethack.alt.org or nostalgia.suroot.com, grab [[ttyrec]]s from [https://alt.org/nethack/ttyrecs.php NAO] or [http://nostalgia.suroot.com/ttyrec/index.html Nostalgia].
