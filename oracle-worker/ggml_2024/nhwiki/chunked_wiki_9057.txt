An '''orcish arrow''' is an [[arrow]] for use with a [[bow]]. It appears as a '''crude arrow''' when [[identification|unidentified]]. It is slightly less effective than a regular arrow. If you are an [[orc (starting race)|orcish player]] firing them from an [[orcish bow]], your [[multishot]] counter is increased by 1, meaning you may multishot up to one more arrow than otherwise.

==Generation==
Orcish [[Ranger]]s start with an orcish bow and stacks of orcish arrows instead of a regular bow and arrows.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|216|nethack=3.6.6}}

[[Uruk-hai]] have a {{frac|3}} chance of being generated with an orcish bow and {{rn1|12|3}} [[poison]]ed orcish arrows.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|412|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|157|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Orcish arrows are often spawned [[poisoned]], allowing a 10% instant death chance against many early game monsters. This overcomes the lower damage, though it's bad to be on the receiving end of them without [[poison resistance]]. And it's hard to come by any without having them shot at you.

Orcish [[ranger]]s are in a particular position to benefit from using orcish arrows, because they begin the game with the gear necessary to multishot them and can ignore the dangers of poison in retrieving them. 

These arrows are less useful to non-orcs, as they have less damage and are uncommon to find after the early game. If you are lacking in arrows, orcish arrows can at least fill the quiver slot to keep more preferable fodder from breaking in use.

A '''silver arrow''' is an [[arrow]] for use with a [[bow]]. It deals the same base damage as a regular arrow, but can also cause [[silver damage]].

== Strategy ==
Silver arrows can clear a five-lane highway through silver hating monsters, but unfortunately, they are fairly rare—only twelve in a thousand randomly spawned weapons will be silver arrows. Fortunately, however, with maximized [[Luck]] even a small stack can last a fairly long time.

== History ==
Prior to version 3.6.0,wielding a silver arrow and stabbing monsters with it did not do [[silver damage]]. Nor did throwing the arrow. Only shooting the arrow with a bow dealt silver damage. This was considered a [[bug#C343-2|bug]] by the [[DevTeam]], and it was fixed.

The '''ya''' is a projectile weapon that appears in ''[[Nethack]]''. It is a type of [[arrow]] designed for use with a [[yumi]]. Ya arrowheads are made of [[metal]], and ya appear as '''bamboo arrows''' when unidentified.

Ya do the most base damage out of all arrows (1d7 versus 1d6 for normal arrows) and have a +1 bonus to hit. Samurai firing ya from a [[yumi]] gain a +1 [[multishot]] bonus.

==Generation==
In addition to random generation, [[Samurai]] will always start the game with 26 to 45 ya.

==Strategy==
Ya are the only arrows to have a [[to-hit]] bonus and are inherently [[erode]]proof, making them high-quality projectiles for most bow-wielding roles; Samurai are the most likely to get any use out of them, due to starting with the required yumi. While a solid option for other bow-wielding characters such as [[Ranger]]s, the lack of bonuses outside the inherent +1 to-hit and the relative rarity of the projectiles and/or their launcher can be limiting.

==History==
Ya and yumi are introduced in [[NetHack 3.1.0]]. In previous versions, Samurai started with a standard [[bow]] and arrows.

== Origin ==
{{wikipedia|Ya (arrow)}}
''Ya'' are a real world arrow type used by Japanese archers, around 85-110 centimeters (33-43 inches) compared to the 75-90 centimeters (30-35 inches) of the 'standard' arrow. Their size is designed specifically for the very large ''yumi''. The to-hit bonus may suggest ''ya'' with a [[wikipedia:Bodkin point|bodkin point]], a common medieval war-time arrow in many societies designed to penetrate armor (particularly [[chain mail|chain]] or [[ring mail]]).

A '''crossbow bolt''' is a type of [[stackable]] [[projectile]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are designed for use with a [[crossbow]], and are made of [[iron]].

Like other cursed [[missile]] weapons, crossbow bolts have a chance of [[Projectile#Breakage|breaking]] after hitting a monster; cursed bolts will occasionally "slip" when [[throw]]ing or [[firing]] them and end up on the ground. Crossbow bolts can be poisoned by dipping them in a [[potion of sickness]].

==Generation==
All [[Gnome (starting race)|Gnomish]] [[Ranger]]s start the game with stacks of +0 and +2 crossbow bolts and a +1 crossbow, rather than a bow and arrows;{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|110|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|743|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} crossbows and crossbow bolts are considered [[racial equipment]] for gnomes, though gnomish Rangers are the only case where this substitution applies.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|231|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Plains and mountain [[centaur]]s have a {{frac|2}} chance of generating with a crossbow and {{rn1|12|3}} bolts.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|462|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Crossbows and their ammo can also be generated on any monster lacking the [[strong]] [[monster attribute]] that can use a weapon, but has not received one.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|529|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Crossbow skill==
{{crossbow skill table}}

The crossbow is the only [[launcher]] to use crossbow bolts.

==Description==
Crossbow bolts launched from a crossbow will always fire at their maximum range of 8 squares, but are subject to a [[multishot]] penalty if their user is below a certain [[strength]] level - gnomes must have at least 16 strength to obtain full [[multishot]] bonuses, gnomes who aren't [[Healer]]s or [[Wizard]]s also gain a +1 [[multishot]] racial bonus when firing bolts from a crossbow; other races require at least 18 strength in order to avoid multishot penalties.

==Strategy==
{{main|Crossbow}}
High-strength characters lacking a ranged weapon may choose to retrieve a crossbow and bolts from the [[Gnome (monster class)|gnomes]] in the [[Gnomish Mines]]; bolts are somewhat scarce compared to arrows, which are much more commonplace due to the various arrow types and [[arrow trap]]s. As with most launchers, the bolts themselves should be enchanted rather than the crossbow in order to increase their damage.

[[Monk]]s looking to maintain [[weaponless]] conduct may elect to carry a crossbow and bolts on hand; Rogues can also get Expert in crossbow, making them an option for their long-term ranged weapon. Gnomish rangers may have to rely on their [[pet]] in the early game to kill their fellow gnomes for additional bolts - though the [[Ranger quest]] provides a plentiful source as early as the midgame, they will also have to look out for attack [[wand]]s; their [[quest artifact]], [[The Longbow of Diana]], also forces them to switch launcher and ammo types as well.

==History==
Crossbow bolts have been present in the game since Hack 1.21, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]]. Their special behavior with regards to range and multishot were introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] introduces an artifact crossbow, [[Hellfire]], that is [[chaotic]]-aligned and causes bolts fired from it to produce a 3x3 fiery explosion centered on any monster that it hits.

[[Undead Slayer]]s have a chance of starting the game with a crossbow and bolts.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], gnomish players are always given a crossbow and bolts in place of a regular bow and arrows; all gnomes get an extra die of weapon damage when firing bolts from crossbows.

Crossbow bolts are no longer granted multiple shots at higher skill levels, instead increasing the damage dealt by a single crossbow bolt:

* Basic or lower: 1x(bolt+enchantment) damage
* Skilled: 2x(bolt+enchantment) damage.
* Expert: 3x(bolt+enchantment) damage.

In addition, each shot adds 3x the damage bonus from the current skill level (-5 Restricted, -2 Unskilled, +0 at Basic, +2 at Skilled and +5 at Expert). The extra damage is precision-based and does not apply against amorphous, stationary, or incorporeal monsters, which are assumed to lack discernible weak-points.

===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], crossbows now fire a set range regardless of strength, and require high strength to fire mulitple shots.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], [[bolt traps]] appear in the dungeon that can be [[untrap]]ped to obtain their crossbow bolts.

Gnomish Rangers have a new quest artifact, [[The Crossbow of Carl]], which is an artifact crossbow that mirrors The Longbow of Diana given to other Rangers. This allows them to preserve their multishot bonuses while also giving access to an unlimited source of crossbow bolts.

===SlashTHEM===
For [[SlashTHEM]], on top of SLASH'EM additions, [[Warrior]]s start each game with a +1 crossbow and a stack of +0 crossbow bolts; Undead Slayers now have a {{frac|2}} chance to start with a crossbow and some bolts.

[[Player monster]] undead slayers and gnomish non-[[Cavemen]] are likely to generate with a crossbow and some bolts.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], [[merfolk (starting race)|merfolk]] in roles that would start the game with a bow and arrows receive a crossbow and bolts instead.

A '''shuriken''' is a type of [[weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is made of [[iron]], and appears as a '''throwing star''' when [[identification|unidentified]] - every [[Samurai]] starts the game with knowledge of shuriken.

Shuriken are [[stackable]] weapons designed to be [[thrown]] by hand, and gain a +2 [[to-hit]] bonus when thrown - they can break on impact like some other [[projectile]]s and [[missile]]s, and can be poisoned by [[dip]]ping them in a [[potion of sickness]]. [[Monk]]s gain a +1 [[multishot]] bonus when throwing shuriken, while [[ninja]] and [[Monk (player monster)|monk]] [[player monster]]s gain a multishot bonus when throwing shuriken at [[you]] or other [[monster]]s.<ref>{{sourceref|monmulti}}</ref>

==Generation==
Shuriken are quite rare, making up 3.5% of randomly-generated weapons - this amounts to 0.35% of all randomly found objects in the main dungeon, 0.42% of all items on the [[Rogue level]], and 0.7% of all items in [[Gehennom]].{{refsrc|src/objects.c|130|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Ninja have a {{frac|3|4}} chance of [[Monster starting inventory|generating with a stack of shuriken]], and will otherwise receive a stack of [[dart]]s.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|267|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Monk player monsters have a {{frac|3}} chance of a stack of shuriken replacing the melee weapon they are generated with, and will otherwise generate with no melee weapon.{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|205|version=NetHack 3.6.6|name=monsndx}}

==Shuriken skill==
{{shuriken skill table}}

Shuriken are the only weapons to use this skill, and there are no [[artifact weapon|artifact]] shuriken.

==Strategy==
Each shuriken weighs only 1 [[aum]] similar to [[dart]]s, and their damage when thrown eclipses that of thrown [[dagger]]s - they are stellar weapons to enchant and poison (especially if you are not [[lawful]]), and are employed against dangerous melee-range threats such as [[mind flayer]]s. Their to-hit bonus can also help offset the penalty for throwing them at [[Unskilled]].

In practice, though, the shuriken's rarity makes it difficult to train the skill or make long-term use of them without [[polypiling]]; a [[wish]] can be used to either procure a stack of shuriken directly, or more commonly to obtain something they can polypile them with (e.g. a [[wand of polymorph]]). Samurai are the primary exception to this "rule", as ninja generate exclusively in the [[Samurai quest]] and often carry shuriken - this makes it far easier for them to assemble and enchant a stockpile and to train the skill to Expert, especially with high [[Luck]].

Of the three roles that can attain Skilled in shuriken, [[Healer]]s can also reach Skilled in daggers and [[sling]], as well as Expert in darts - all three are far more common, but generally deal less damage and are overall heavier to carry; darts are the only option of those three that can be poisoned and multishot, and are just as light as shuriken. [[Ranger]]s gain multishot bonuses with arrows, as do [[Rogue]]s using daggers, making them superior preferable to shuriken thrown at Skilled.

[[Monk]]s are in a unique situation: they can only reach Basic in shuriken, but their role-specific multishot bonus makes it their best non-melee weapon by far to advance skill in - of the other options available, [[spear]]s are generally heavy, and [[crossbow bolt]]s require that you keep a [[crossbow]] wielded. [[Weaponless]] Monks may consider enchanting and blessing any shuriken they find or even polypiling for them, which provides one of the [[conduct]]'s few uses for the [[scroll of enchant weapon]].

==History==
The shuriken is first introduced in [[NetHack 1.3d]] alongside the Samurai and the now-defunct [[Ninja (role)|Ninja]] role. Samurai from NetHack 1.3d to [[NetHack 3.0.10]] started the game with a stack of up to 9 shuriken that may be blessed;<ref>[[NetHack 3.0.0/u_init.c#line200|NetHack 3.0.0 u_init.c, line 200]]; NetHack 3.0.10 u_init.c, line 206</ref> Ninja from NetHack 1.3d to [[NetHack 2.3e]] started the game with up to 25 shuriken.<ref>[[Source:NetHack 2.3e/u init.c#line184|NetHack 2.3e u_init.c, line 184]]</ref>

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Shuriken}}
A shuriken (手裏剣, literally "hidden hand blade") is a Japanese concealed weapon used to distract, misdirect or otherwise misdirect enemies. Though they are also known in Western cultures as throwing stars, or ninja stars, they were originally designed in many different shapes - there are a few major varieties of shuriken such as the dart-like ''bō shuriken'' (棒手裏剣, "stick shuriken"), with the star-shaped ones being known as ''hira shuriken'' (平手裏剣, "flat shuriken") or ''shaken'' (車剣, "wheel shuriken"). The curriculum of many famous swordsmanship and martial arts schools taught the art of wielding shuriken, and they were often seen as important tactical supplements to the sword or various other weapons in a samurai's arsenal.

==Variants==
Some variants adjust the skill caps for shuriken and/or make them easier to obtain through certain methods.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], [[garo]] may be generated with a stack of shuriken, and the unique [[garo master]] always generates carrying shuriken. [[Maid]]s may also generate with a stack of shuriken for non-Samurai players, and [[Master Kaen]] will generate with his own stack of up to 48 [[Gold (material)|golden]] shuriken. The [[Fuma-itto no Ken]] is a [[chaotic]] [[artifact weapon|artifact]] [[broadsword]] that can be [[invoke]]d to create shuriken, similar to [[the Longbow of Diana]]'s ability to create arrows.

Shuriken are added to [[Samurai#dNetHack|the expanded list]] of [[Samurai#Japanese names for items|Japanese item names]], and will appear as "hira-shuriken" to Samurai, while darts are called "bo-shuriken".

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], Monks can reach expert in shuriken.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], shuriken instead appear as '''razor cards''' for [[Cartomancer]]s.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Wizards no longer have the shuriken skill.

Stacks of shuriken can be given to a player as a "minor" gift from their [[god]] via [[sacrifice]], and gifted shuriken will be erodeproofed and often enchanted - Monks that maintain weaponless conduct will always receive shuriken when given a gift this way as opposed to the standard armor and weapons, with the exception of [[artifact]]s.

Shuriken can be created at a [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forge]] by combining 2 darts and a dagger; both components are incredibly commonplace in the dungeon, providing any role with easy access to shuriken and the means to create stockpiles that use specific [[Object materials (EvilHack)|materials]] and/or [[object properties|properties]].

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], shuriken are also known by different names to Samurai and Ninja, similar to dNetHack; "standard" shuriken appear as "hira-shuriken", while darts are called "bo-shuriken".

SlashTHEM also adds the Fuma-itto no Ken from dNetHack, which retains its invoke ability and acts as the [[quest artifact]] for the revived Ninja role.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
You know, that's what I hate most about fighting against magic:
you never know what they're trying to do to you until it hits.
The sorceress knew what hit her, however.  Two of the shuriken
got past whatever defenses she had.  One caught her just below
the throat, the other in the middle of her chest.  It wouldn't
kill her, but she wouldn't be fighting anyone for a while.

A '''boomerang''' is a type of [[ranged weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is made of [[wood]], and can be stacked and [[multishot]]. 

== Boomerang skill ==
{{boomerang skill table}}

Boomerangs are the only weapons to use '''boomerang skill'''.

==Description==
When thrown, a boomerang will travel in a circular path counterclockwise from the direction thrown, hitting anything in its path: it will alternate with [[(]] as it flies to show spinning.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3531|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} If it makes its way back to you, there is a ([[dexterity]] in 20) chance of catching the boomerang safely{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3570|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} - if this rolls fails, or the boomerang is [[cursed]] or thrown while [[fumbling]], you are hit, aborting any multishot attempts.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3515|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Boomerangs will not return if their path is blocked by a wall, or if they move over a [[sink]].{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3585|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

When used as a melee weapon rather than thrown, a boomerang has a luck-dependent chance of breaking into splinters.{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|750|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

{{todo|Boomerangs in 3.6.0 seem to stop whenever they pass over or hit a monster.}}

== Strategy ==
Though the boomerang has useful features, the unusual flight path tends to make it a rarely-used weapon, and enchanted [[gauntlets of dexterity]] might be necessary to ensure completely safe operation. However, players more interested in doing damage than having the weapon return can still use this weapon effectively over a range up to four spaces:

Assume a monster is approaching you from a cardinal direction (N,S,E,W). If it approaches from the N, it can be hit at a distance of four spaces by throwing to the NW (45 degrees counter-clockwise) if there are at least two open tiles to the W. A monster at a distance of three spaces to the N can be hit by throwing to the W (90 degrees counter-clockwise) if there are three open tiles in that direction. Any monster can be hit at two spaces by throwing directly at it (the only available option in hallways). Monsters approaching from an ordinal direction (NE,NW,SE,SW) can also only be hit at two spaces. 

Boomerangs can be particularly effective against [[unicorn]]s, who will always attempt to avoid any direct line of ranged attack. They can also be especially effective in large open spaces with crowds of monsters, like the [[Big Room]]. However, as with other projectiles it is unwise to throw during [[levitation]].

==History==
The boomerang first appears in [[Hack 1.0]].

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, along with some variants based on those versions, boomerangs cannot be multishot and fly clockwise when thrown.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Boomerang}}
A boomerang is a thrown tool, typically constructed as a flat airfoil and designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. Boomerangs and paintings depicting them have been found that date back to more than 10,000 years ago - they have been historically used for hunting, as well as sport and entertainment, and are primarily restricted to the latter in modern times. Though commonly thought of as an Aborigine/Indigenous Australian icon, boomerangs come in various shapes and sizes and have also been found in ancient Europe, Egypt, and North America.

The standard boomerang and associated flight arc used in most fictional media is actually closer to a specific type of "returning" boomerang - those designed for hunting are typically "straight-flying", and there were others used for hand-to-hand combat. It is speculated that "returning" boomerangs were developed from flattened throwing sticks still used by the Australian Aborigines, American Navajo and other indigenous peoples around the world; hunting boomerangs are more delicately balanced and difficult to make in comparison.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
Rincewind pulled himself up and thought about reaching for his stick.  And then he thought again.  The man had a couple of spears stuck in the ground, and people here were good at spears, because if you didn't get efficient at hitting the things that moved fast you had to eat the things that moved slowly.  He was also holding a boomerang, and it wasn't one of those toy ones that came back. This was one of the big, heavy, gently curved sort that didn't come back because it was sticking in something's ribcage.  You could laugh at the idea of wooden weapons until you saw the kind of wood that grew here.

Runed [[elven spear]]s and stout [[dwarvish spear]]s are superior to ordinary spears, while crude [[orcish spear]]s are predictably inferior. [[Silver spear]]s deal the same base damage as ordinary ones, but add bonus damage versus [[Silver#Silver damage|silver-haters]].

== Spear skill ==

{{spear skill table}}

The following weapons use the spear skill:

* spear
* dwarvish spear
* elven spear
* orcish spear
* silver spear
* [[javelin]]

Spears have an additional +2 [[to-hit]] bonus against all monsters when thrown.

Weapons in the spear class have a +2 to-hit bonus when hitting [[kebabable]] monster classes.

In versions of NetHack prior to 3.6.0, [[javelin]]s had their own ''javelin'' skill that consisted solely of javelins, but it has since been merged into the spear skill. When unidentified, a [[javelin]] appears as a 'throwing spear'.

There are no [[artifact weapon|artifact]] spears in vanilla NetHack.

[[Elf (monster attribute)|Elves]] may be generated with an elven spear.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|250|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=elven spears}} In addition, elven spears make up about 1.0% of randomly generated weapons.

Being made of [[wood]], elven spears are naturally immune to [[erosion|corrosion and rusting]].

An '''orcish spear''', which appears as a '''crude spear''' when [[identification|unidentified]], does the least damage versus [[Physical size|small]] monsters of any of the spears, one point less than even the ordinary spear.

Curiously, no monsters are generated with orcish spears&mdash;not even any of the [[Orc (monster class)|orc]]s.  They make up about 1.3% of randomly generated weapons, however.

The '''silver spear''' is the rarest kind of spear, making up just 0.2% of randomly generated weapons.  It deals the same base damage as a regular spear, but being made of [[silver]], it deals additional damage to [[Silver#Silver damage|silver-hating]] monsters.
{{clear}}

==Generation==
Spears of all kinds make up about 9.7% of randomly generated weapons (on the ground, as [[death drop]]s, and in [[shop]]s).  In addition, [[watchmen]], [[soldier]]s in the [[Yendorian army]],{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|199|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=mercenary spears}} [[salamander]]s,{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|436|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=salamander spears}} and [[ice devil]]s{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|694|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=ice devil spears}} may be generated with a spear. 

==Strategy==

In the absence of [[dagger]] skills, a small stack of spears is a powerful [[ranged weapon]] for any [[Caveman]] or [[Priest]] lucky enough to find more than one. Generally you need to encounter a large [[shop|antique weapons outlet]] to find them in any number. However, spears are quite heavy (three spears weigh more than a [[pick-axe]]), so they have a tendency to cause [[encumbrance]] problems.

Spears can be [[multishot]] as of NetHack 3.6.0.  [[Cavemen]] get a +1 multishot bonus for throwing spears.{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|138|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=Caveman multishot}}

The silver spear does only one point less damage on average against small or medium monsters than a [[silver saber]], and the same against large monsters (which include most major [[demon]]s), making it an attractive option for roles restricted in saber, such as [[Cavemen]], [[Priest]]s, and especially [[Monk]]s. [[Valkyrie]]s and [[Samurai]] might also consider this weapon for two-weaponing as they can be skilled in spear versus basic in saber, overcoming the damage difference.

===UnNetHack, SporkHack and SLASH'EM===
In [[UnNetHack]], [[SporkHack]], and [[SLASH'EM]], [[Dragonbane]] is a dwarvish spear.

==Origin==

The spear is a weapon designed for thrusting. Chimpanzees use very rudimentary spears, so it is likely that humans have used spears for an extremely long time.

The related [[lance]] is designed for jousting and the [[javelin]] for throwing.

'''Displacement''' is a [[property]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' that causes your image to appear a tile or two away from where you actually are, which can misdirect the attacks of [[hostile]] [[monster]]s. The [[cloak of displacement]] is currently the only source of the property: no monsters have intrinsic displacement.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|[[Displacer beast]]s have the displacement property, which is implemented similar to some of the variants listed below; fighting them may cause you to displace them instead of attacking; force-fighting via {{kbd|F}} may similarly cause you to attack thin air. The [[corpse]] or [[tin]] of a displacer beast confers temporary intrinsic displacement when eaten.}}

==Description==
Displacement will make a particular given monster think you are at a random square within a 5&times;5 area centered on the player; in other words, the monster will think you are 0&ndash;2 squares away from where you are. If you do not have a clear line of sight to the monster, it will only generate the image in a 3&times;3 square around you; this is presumably to prevent monsters being alerted to your presence from well around corners, or from the other side of a closed door.

A monster that does not know your location has a {{frac|4}} chance of figuring out where you actually are during each of its turns; a monster that knows your location is not affected by displacement, but you must be 'found' again each time you move, similar to [[invisibility]]. A monster fooled by your displaced image will often attack it instead of you - the monster may even move in the wrong direction entirely, with the odds of this varying widely depending on your surroundings and movement.<!--Old revision claimed a range of 0-28%, with odds "generally 8.7% in an open room if you're moving away from the monster"; citation + math check would be lovely.--> Shopkeepers and aligned priests are not fooled by displacement if you are generating [[conflict]], and they will not hesitate to attack you. 

Displacement is done per-monster, so your displaced image will generally be in two different locations for two different monsters. This makes it possible for one monster to see your image in the square of another monster - monster melee attacks that target such a square will miss, but breath weapons, ranged weapons and the like will still deal damage.

===Bribery===
If a lawful [[demon prince]] teleports to you to demand a bribe while you have displacement, they may warp next to your displaced image; this will cause them to become hostile without a chance of being pacified.

==Strategy==
Displacement is invaluable when running from a fight you are ill-equipped for, especially in the early game. Non-[[Elf (starting race)|elven]] [[Ranger]]s notably start with a +2 cloak of displacement - elven rangers are given an [[elven cloak]] instead to counterbalance their better weapons.

In terms of combat, invisibility is a property of somewhat similar use that applies a &minus;2 to-hit penalty to monsters that cannot see you, and tends to be far more common and accessible than displacement. Even if you are discovered, moving will cause them to lose track of your presence and attack the square you previously occupied; displacement does not affect monster awareness of your presence so much as their ability to pinpoint you. However, the odds of discovery are more likely for invisibility, with a {{frac|3}} chance during each of their turns compared to {{frac|4}} with displacement. Since both properties function on a per-monster-turn basis, fast monsters such as [[soldier ants]] are likely to find you quickly no matter which of them you use - invisibility will also override displacement if you have both properties, unless you are fighting monsters that can see invisible. On a somewhat lesser note, being invisible will cause [[shopkeeper]]s to block the entrances to their [[shop]] - they can also see invisible and will not be fooled by displacement if angered.

In the long term, monsters that can [[see invisible]] become more common as you progress; fewer monsters are unaffected by displacement, and even demon lords and princes can be fooled by it, though beware of this if you intend to bribe the lawful ones!

==Variants==
Some variants implement a form of monster displacement: among those, a few also grant it to two [[Deferred feature|deferred monsters]] within the code - the shimmering dragon, whose scales are intended to confirm displacement, and its baby form.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], monster displacement exists: only [[displacer beast]]s have the property intrinsically. Shimmering dragons and their babies instead have a much lower [[AC]] than other dragons, simulating "displacement" by making them harder to hit.

===GruntHack===
[[GruntHack]] implements proper displacement for monsters. Monsters can appear in a different location from where they actually are, including inside walls, or on another monster's location. Monster displacement will only fool the player character's vision - [[telepathy]] or [[monster detection]] will reveal their actual location, making it possible for the displaced monster to show up on two different squares. Trying to walk onto a displaced monster's square will not attack it.

[[Dragon (GruntHack)|Adult shimmering dragons]] have intrinsic displacement, and their scales confer displacement.

===FIQHack===
[[FIQHack]] implements monster displacement that is somewhat similar to GruntHack, with the following differences:

* If you can sense the monster with telepathy, monster detection or similar, the displaced image will never be shown. If you can't see the displaced image, but would be able to see the true location, you will see the monster's true location.
* The displaced image will never appear in a spot the monster couldn't normally be on, such as inside walls.
* You will (try to) attack displaced images if moving onto them. If there is another monster there, you will attack it. The same thing now happens if a monster tries to attack your (or another monster's) displaced image that is on another monster.

Shimmering dragons, their baby forms and their scales are also present; unlike in GruntHack, baby shimmering dragons have intrinsic displacement as well as adults.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], eating a displacer beast corpse will confer intrinsic displacement for a short time.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], monsters can gain displacement via wearing the cloak or the shimmering dragon's scales/scale mail, and monster displacement functions similarly to EvilHack.

A '''javelin''' is a [[weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. When [[identification|unidentified]], it appears as a '''throwing spear'''.

Javelins use the [[spear]] skill, and have a +2 to-hit bonus when hitting [[kebabable]] monster classes.

==Generation==
Javelins make up about 1.0% of randomly generated weapons (on the ground, as [[death drop]]s, and in [[shop]]s).

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and derived variants, javelins were the only weapon that used a separate '''javelin''' skill. This was because of the different uses of spears - javelins were intended for throwing and spears for thrusting. [[NetHack 3.6.0]] merged the javelin and spear skills for gameplay reasons.

A '''trident''' is a kind of [[weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is made of [[iron]]. Tridents have a special +4 [[to-hit]] bonus against [[swimmer|swimming monsters]] that are in [[water]], and a secondary +2 to-hit bonus against any {{monclass|S}} or {{monclass|;}} that is not in water.{{refsrc|src/weapon.c|163|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Generation==
Tridents are one of the rarer weapons in the game, making up only about 0.8% of all randomly generated weapons. 

[[Horned devil]]s have a {{frac|3|4}} chance of [[monster starting inventory|being generated with a trident]], and [[salamander]]s have a {{frac|2|21}} chance (approximately 9.5%).{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|483|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|496|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Trident skill==
{{trident skill table}}

Tridents are the only weapon to use the trident [[skill]]. There are no [[artifact]] tridents.

==Strategy==
Though tridents are not typically sought out as a primary weapon, they are a popular choice of secondary weapon for [[twoweapon]]ing: they are the most damaging weapon against large monsters that can be used in the off-hand, and are comparable to [[saber]]s, [[crysknives]] and [[katana]]s, averaging one more point of damage versus large monsters compared to a katana . However, their rarity means that players will usually obtain the aforementioned items or another viable off-hand weapon before encountering a trident.

==History==
Tridents first appear in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Trident}}
[[Image:Trident, Burmese, 18th century.JPG|thumb|A real world trident]]
Tridents have origins dating back to ancient Greece and Rome, and have been used for both fishing and combat historically and in modern times; in warfare, tridents were favored for their long reach and ability to disarm and dismount horse-riding combatants. A trident is the divine instrument of the Greek god [[Poseidon]], as indicated by the encyclopedia entry - this can explain the to-hit bonus against sea monsters and swimmers, as does its uses in fishing. The trident also sees use often in heraldry and military emblems.

The word "trident" originates from the Latin ''tridentis'' (lit. "three teeth"), referring to its trio of smooth tines: tridents designed primarily for fishing usually have barbed tines. This is part of the basis for the 3 dice used to calculate damage versus large monsters; the trident is also explicitly noted as a "spearish" weapon by the code, hence its position in the list of objects and its hitdie versus small monsters.{{refsrc|src/objects.c|151|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

In ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', [http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Trident tridents] deal 1d8 base damage versus opponents, but have a lower critical hit multiplier than the [http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Spear long spear], which has the same hitdie. This results in tridents having lower average damage, though tridents also allow the use of a shield or an off-hand weapon.

==Messages==
{{message|That was pure chewing satisfaction!|You ate a trident while in the form of a metallivore.}}
{{message|Four out of five dentists agree.|As above, while [[hallucinating]].}}

==Variants==
===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Infidels can unlock and train the trident skill to Expert if they are [[crowned]].

Tridents can be created at a [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forge]] by combining a [[scimitar]] and a [[spear]]. EvilHack also adds [[Angelslayer]], an [[unaligned]] artifact trident.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], [[Poseidon's Treasure]] is an [[artifact weapon]] trident that acts as the [[Diver]]'s first [[sacrifice gift]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Poseido(o)n, lord of the seas and father of rivers and fountains, was the son of Chronos and Rhea, brother of Zeus, Hades, Hera, Hestia and Demeter.  His rank of ruler of the waves he received by lot at the Council Meeting of the Gods, at which Zeus took the upper world for himself and gave dominion over the lower world to Hades.
Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and guardian deity of horse races.
His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of earthquakes as well.  Physically, he is shown as a strong and powerful ruler, every inch a king.

A '''scalpel''' is a kind of [[melee]] [[weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It uses the [[knife]] [[skill]], and does d3 damage to both small and large [[monster]]s. Scalpels are not suitable for [[throw]]ing like other knives, and doing so carries a -2 [[to-hit]] penalty.{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1066|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1674|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} They are made of [[metal]].

==Generation==
Scalpels are not randomly generated on the dungeon floor, in [[shop]]s, or as a [[death drop]].  

All [[Healer]]s start with a [[Enchantment|+0]] scalpel as their weapon.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|60|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} A scalpel in a [[bones]] pile is usually left by a Healer.

[[Player monster]] [[healer (player monster)|healer]]s on the [[Astral Plane]] have a 6.25% chance of [[monster starting inventory|generating with]] a scalpel in lieu of their initial weapon.{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|192|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Scalpels are very poor weapons roughly on par with [[orcish dagger]]s, with the only real advantage being their inherently [[erosion]]-proof material. However, knives tend to be sparse compared to other projectile weapons like daggers, and are slightly worse melee weapons themselves. In any case, the starting scalpel for Healers may be worth keeping as a backup weapon against monsters such as [[acid blob]]s that can corrode or rust weapons; you can stash or simply ditch it once you gather a decent stack of knives and/or obtain a primary weapon that is either non-iron or erode-proofed.

==History==
The scalpel first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

A bug caused player monster healers to receive stacks of scalpels during monster generation; this was fixed in [[NetHack 3.6.2]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
Scalpels are a little more useful in [[SLASH'EM]]: Healers can use them to cure [[sickness]] or [[sliming]] using the [[surgery]] [[technique]].

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], [[nurse]]s have a {{frac|5}} chance of generating with a scalpel.<ref>[https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack/blob/master/src/makemon.c#L266 xNetHack src/makemon.c, line 266]</ref> Scalpels also do 1d5 damage versus small monsters and 1d7 damage versus large.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Healers also apply their [[healing spell]] skill level to-hit and damage with scalpels (+0 at basic, +2 at skilled, +3 at expert). At max skill, a scalpel is roughly equivalent to other starting weapons in the hands of a Healer, though it is still outperformed by a [[unicorn]] horn or [[quarterstaff]] at high [[strength]].

All nurses in dNetHack generate with scalpels, as do some [[deminymph]]s. Several hostile nurses in the [[Madman (dNetHack role)|Madman]]'s [[Madman quest|quest branch]] generate wielding sickness-poisoned scalpels.

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, [[Undertaker]]s in [[SlashTHEM]] start with a +2 scalpel as their weapon. Player monster undertakers are always generated with scalpels.

==Encyclopaedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|A scalpel is a very sharp knife used for surgery ... Merely

If you hit an undead monster with garlic, they will [[flee]] for 2d4 turns.{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|992|nethack=3.6.6}}

No undead except [[ghost]]s and [[shade]]s will enter a [[square]] with a clove of garlic on it.{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|1099|nethack=3.6.6}} However, placing garlic on a stairway does not prevent [[covetous]] undead, such as master liches, arch-liches, or [[Vlad the Impaler]], from warping to it.

Undead [[pet]]s will not eat garlic. Currently there are no [[herbivorous]] or [[omnivorous]] undead who might have eaten garlic in any case.

==Origin==
According to [[wikipedia:Garlic#Superstition and mythology|Central European folklore]], garlic can ward off vampires, werewolves and demons.

{{encyclopedia|
1 November - All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed.  The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed.  We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses.  We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea, and off we go.  It is a lovely country. Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities.  They are very, very superstitious.  In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.  I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food, and I can't abide garlic.  Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions.

 |name=web
 |color=lightgray
 |glyph="
 |generation=level 7+ and with [[giant spider]]s
 |effect=Prevents movement
}}

A spider '''web''' is a rare type of non-magical [[trap]]. It is the only trap to use the " symbol, rather than the ^ symbol.

==Generation==
Wherever a web trap randomly generates, a giant spider is also generated{{refsrc|src/mklev.c|1391|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}. Conversely, when a giant spider generates at level-generation time, a web trap will usually be created under it{{refsrc|src/mklev.c|814|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Webs created manually in a special level or themed room do not necessarily generate spiders; the level designer can pass a special flag that suppresses this behavior. In particular, the "Spider nest" themed room won't generate spiders above a certain depth.}}

You can produce webs with the [[Monster (command)|#monster]] command if you are a [[spider]]. All web-related messages reflect whether things are happening to "your web" or "a spider web".

==Effects==
[[Acidic]] monsters dissolve webs they step into, and fiery monsters burn them away. [[Spider]]s, [[amoeboid]] monsters, and [[whirly]] monsters may move into webs without becoming stuck{{refsrc|src/trap.c|811|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}. Fiery monsters are specifically [[fire vortex|fire vortices]], [[flaming sphere]]s, [[fire elemental]]s and [[salamander]]s.{{refsrc|include/mondata.h|70|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

The above effects also apply to players polymorphed into such forms.

===On players===
When triggered, you will be unable to escape it for 0&ndash;12 turns, depending on your [[strength]]:

{|class="prettytable"
!Min Strength
!Max Strength
!Min turns stuck
!Max turns stuck
|-
|0

If your strength was high enough to escape in 0 turns, then the web is destroyed{{refsrc|src/trap.c|1312|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}. If you are wielding [[Sting]], you always escape in 1 turn leaving the web intact{{refsrc|src/hack.c|1235|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}.

===On monsters===
[[Titanothere]]s, [[baluchitherium|balucitheria]], [[purple worm]]s, [[jabberwock]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[balrog]]s, [[kraken]]s, and [[mastodon]]s tear through webs on the same turn they walk into them, destroying the web{{refsrc|src/trap.c|2524|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}. ([[Orion]], [[The Norn]], [[Lord Surtur]] and [[Cyclops]] can also tear through webs in the unlikely event they walk into one).

==Removal==
Attempting to untrap stuck monsters risks trapping you and spreading the web, unless you are polymorphed into a spider{{refsrc|src/trap.c|3952|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/trap.c|4102|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}.

Walk in with greater than 18/50 strength, or burn away with a [[wand of fire]]. If you fail to #untrap a monster that is in a web, you will become stuck in a second web that is created at your current position. You can fill up the entire dungeon with webs in this way, if you so choose.

==History==
Webs were added in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

==Messages==

&&%s&& %s Leprechaun hall {134809 2020-07-04T23:26:10Z {4000978 Aximili} Add source A '''leprechaun hall''' is a [[special room]] filled with sleeping [[leprechaun]]s and [[gold]].

==Generation==
On an ordinary rooms and corridors level of at least dungeon level 6 which doesn't have a [[shop]] or [[throne room]], there is a 1/8 chance of a leprechaun hall being generated.{{refsrc|src/mklev.c|772|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Leprechaun halls will not be generated if leprechauns are genocided or extinct.

==Messages==
{{message|You enter a leprechaun hall!}}

==Strategy==
{{main|Leprechaun}}
If all the leprechauns wake up, it can be annoying to hunt them down all over the level. If you have [[stealth]], you can fight them one-by-one. Bring a [[bag]] to store all your gold, and all the gold you'll have to pick up from the leprechaun hall.

Leprechaun halls, and other special rooms with sleeping monsters, can be used to train [[polearm]]s skill. Instead of attacking the leprechauns adjacent to you, [[pound]] a leprechaun surrounded by sleeping leprechauns. The leprechaun will be helpless to strike back and unable to escape, unless they were generated with a [[defensive item]] or [[offensive item]].

It may be worth keeping the leprechauns alive and undisturbed until you have [[teleport control]] or at least a [[tinning kit]], so that you can eat them for [[teleportitis]] when you're ready.

&&%s&& %s Recover {149570 2022-12-30T06:01:36Z {4000978 Aximili} /* Running the command */ capital F :''"Crash" redirects here. For the sound effect, see [[One word messages#Sound effects|One word messages&nbsp;§ Sound effects]]''.

'''recover''' is the small utility program that comes with ''NetHack''. It is used to turn temporary level files into a save file, for example after a power outage during a game.

When trying to restart the game, you get the error message:

"There is already a game in progress under your name. Destroy old game? [yn]"

Say no to the above and keep reading.

Unfortunately, the utility is not totally automated. You need to know some basics about the command line. If you have difficulties, you can ask for help on [[Libera]].

==General use==

Depending on your system, you use a command similar to this:
 <fullPath>recover -d <playground> <username>

*''<fullPath>recover'' Actually, the utility is not a normally accessible command, you need to use the full path to the executable.
*''<playground>'' is the [[Playground]] path where the temporary level files were put during gameplay.

This will most likely only rebuild the savefile, but you might need further commands, depending on your system, to actually reuse it.

For [[SLASH'EM]] and probably other variants, it's almost the same as for nethack. Simply replace "nethack" with "slashem" (or other variant name).

For [[Vulture|vulture's eye]], the name is hard-coded to ''alock''. The command is something like this:

 vultureseye-recover -d <playground> alock

==Specifics for Linux/Unix==

===Accidental Ctrl-Z===

First make sure you didn't just press ctrl-Z by accident. This simply suspends the current game with out any real damage. A characteristic "[1]+  Stopped nethack" message is given. Read the "[[fg]]" article first.

===Accidental new shell===
{{todo|What are these keyboard shortcuts for some popular environments??}}

Another possible accidental keyboard shortcut. Depending on the command line environment, terminal simulator or desktop environment, they are various keyboard shortcuts to launch a new shell on top of the one you are currently using. This is inside the same window you are using and no message is given. Apparently you drop back in the command line, with no message.

First make sure you aren't in the "Ctrl-Z" situation. The command "jobs" should return nothing. "Ctrl-Z" is a more frequent error and has a characteristic message. When you excluded "Ctrl-Z", to go back to the game, just give the "exit" command (caution!!!! Read the rest first). This command simply kills the current terminal, in our case the superfluous terminal, so make sure you really are in this situation before you try it. If you give the "exit" command after a "Ctrl-Z", you'll probably have to use the recover utility.

===Running the command===

On Linux and other Unixen, you usually invoke recover like this:
