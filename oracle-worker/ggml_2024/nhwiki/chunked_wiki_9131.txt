Crystal golems do massive amounts of physical damage, and their random breath weapon can occasionally be a blast of [[disintegration]], which can be unpleasant if you don't have [[reflection]].  They are best fought alone, if possible.  Destroying them produces a pile of random valuable gems.  Note that they have intrinsic [[magic resistance]], in the same way that a gray dragon does.

==Hit points==
Like in Vanilla NetHack, golems in SLASH'EM are generated with a fixed number of [[hit points]]. However, even for golems that exist in Vanilla NetHack, that number of hit points is higher in SLASH'EM, as shown in the following table:

{|class="prettytable"
! Golem !! Hit points (Vanilla NetHack) !! Hit points (SLASH'EM)
|-
| [[paper golem]] || 20 || 36
|-
| [[straw golem]] || 20 || 40
|-
| [[wax golem]] || &mdash; || 40
|- 
| [[rope golem]] || 30 || 60
|-
| [[plastic golem]] || &mdash; || 60
|-
| [[gold golem]] || 40 || 80
|-
| [[leather golem]] || 40 || 80
|-
| [[wood golem]] || 50 || 100
|-
| [[flesh golem]] || 40 || 120
|-
| [[glass golem]] || 60 || 140
|-
| [[clay golem]] || 50 || 150
|-
| [[stone golem]] || 60 || 180
|-
| [[iron golem]] || 80 || 240
|-
| [[ruby golem]] || &mdash; || 250
|-
| [[diamond golem]] || &mdash; || 270
|-
| [[sapphire golem]] || &mdash; || 280
|-
| [[steel golem]] || &mdash; || 290
|-
| [[crystal golem]] || &mdash; || 300
|-
| [[Frankenstein's Monster]] || &mdash; || 400
|}

==Strategy==
All of the gemstone golems are highly dangerous; a crystal golem, in one-on-one combat with a character fully prepared for SLASH'EM's lategame, can still deal 120-150 damage before being destroyed.  For this reason, they are all best fought alone if at all possible.  Since they are all slower than a character in [[speed boots]], this should not be too difficult.  [[Stoning]] them is a valid option, as it will turn them into less-dangerous [[stone golem]]s.  The dropped gemstones can be quite useful, particularly for getting wishes from [[gypsy|gypsies]], which start appearing with some frequency around the same time.

The '''wax golem''' is a new [[golem]] added in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[UnNetHack]]. Wax golems have a [[fire]] attack that can destroy potions and scrolls in open inventory, but otherwise is not a significant threat to the player.

What makes this golem significant to players is that it drops [[Light sources#Candles|wax candles]] when destroyed, making wax golems potentially valuable as a non-conduct-violating source of candles in those games where [[Izchak]]'s lighting store doesn't have enough candles to perform the [[invocation]].

For other golems added in SLASH'EM and UnNetHack, see the list of [[Golem_(SLASH'EM)|new golems in SLASH'EM]] and [[UnNetHack#Bestiary_2|UnNetHack]].

A '''vampire mage''' is a new monster in [[SLASH'EM]] (and also a deferred feature in NetHack).  It is considerably stronger than a vampire lord, and is able to cast [[monster spell|spells]]. A +3 (or higher) weapon is needed to damage this monster.

==Strategy==
Vampire mages are excellent at wreaking havoc in the later levels of SLASH'EM. Since they are not [[covetous]], they will not warp to the up staircase when hit, but instead will simply flee. As long as they have you in their sight, though, they will continue to [[summon nasties]], and the ring of monsters they will create around you can make it nearly impossible to reach them, particularly on open, [[no-teleport]] levels such as [[Juiblex's swamp]] or [[Moloch's Sanctum]]. It is not uncommon for them to have filled half the level with nasties in such places before you can destroy them. They should therefore be destroyed with extreme prejudice, even in preference to [[arch-lich]]es, since the latter will flee to the up staircase and (likely) out of sight of you when hit even a little bit. They are an excellent target for uncursed [[genocide]].

Vampires are usually generated with [[opera cloak]]s, which can potentially be a [[cloak of magic resistance]]; this would imperil spellcasters since [[magic missile]], the main spell of [[wizard]]s, is completely ineffective against them, in addition to several other spells.

===As pets===
Vampire lords will grow up into vampire mages at level 20. This makes taming a vampire much more attractive in SLASH'EM, as a relatively weak vampire will quickly grow into a level 30 terror. Vampire mages are nearly immune to monster attacks, due to regeneration, healing spells, low base AC plus the ability to wear armor, and requiring a +3 weapon to take any damage at all, making them excellent pets as long as they have not been genocided. In addition, vampires in SLASH'EM can drain corpses; this will increase their tameness, making it far easier to prevent them from going feral. They also will never become hungry; they simply drain any corpse they find. Unfortunately, vampire mages are capable of [[Pet_(SLASH'EM)#Treachery|spontaneously rebelling]], particularly if you are much weaker than them and/or you abuse them.

Note that if you want to give your vampire mage armor, you will need to make sure it is not blessed. They will avoid blessed items as most pets will avoid cursed items.

A ghoul mage is a monster in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is able to cast spells up to [[curse items]], and occasionally [[aggravate monster]], as well as doing a small amount of physical damage.  Note that, unlike most other Z, it is not mindless, and can be detected via [[telepathy]].

==Strategy==
These are not very dangerous, but they can be a great annoyance, mostly because they are very fond of [[curse items|cursing]] your items, since they cannot cast that many other spells.  If you don't have a convenient way of uncursing or protecting your items (such as [[Magicbane]] or a [[spellbook of remove curse]], they should be given a high priority for destruction, and may even be worth a [[scroll of genocide]].

A rabbit is a rodent in [[SLASH'EM]].  It can be tamed with a carrot.  A more powerful variant also exists, the [[rabid rabbit]].
==Strategy==
Probably the first 'new' monster one will encounter in SLASH'EM, the rabbit is functionally almost equivalent to the [[fox]].  It has the same attacks, level and speed, making it somewhat dangerous to starting characters, mostly due to the speed.  Note that its corpse is much lighter and less filling than that of the fox, however.

A ghoul queen is an infrequently seen monster in [[SLASH'EM]], not being randomly generated.  They appear in the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Temple of Moloch|Temple of Moloch]], and can also be generated by the summon undead spell ("Undead creatures are called forth from the grave!") that liches gain in SLASH'EM.

==Strategy== 
Oftentimes, one will find ghoul queens able to [[summon nasties]].  Like the [[Vampire mage (SLASH'EM)|vampire mage]], they are not [[covetous]], and so will not warp away after being hit a few times.  Their dual spellcasting attacks make them quite dangerous, as they are quite able to quickly fill the level with nasties.  Even in melee combat they are dangerous, as they are quite likely to curse your items.  An artifact weapon that does double damage against them is advisable; in general, the large number of undead spellcasters in SLASH'EM makes [[Sunsword]] quite an appealing weapon, for those who can obtain it.

Frankenstein's Monster is a unique golem appearing in [[Frankenstein's Lab]]. By the time the player encounters him, he should not be a huge threat. Essentially, it is a somewhat stronger [[flesh golem]]. He does, however, have a lot of hit points (400).

	the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark

	already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against
	the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the
	glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow

	had endeavoured to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I
	had selected his features as beautiful.  Beautiful!--Great God! 
	His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and
	arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and
	flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances

'''Lightsabers''' are [[weapon-tool]]s found in the variants [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNetHack]].  In each variant they are powerful [[melee]] weapons whose use is highly restricted.

}}
===Use as a weapon===
Lightsabers in SLASH'EM have their own weapon [[skill]].  All roles in SLASH'EM are restricted in this skill, but can reach Basic if they have it unrestricted by [[crowning]].  (The [[Jedi]] role, available as a patch, can reach Expert skill in lightsaber.)

The four varieties are green, blue, red and double red.  Green, blue, and red lightsabers are single-handed, have a -3 to-hit penalty, and do the same amount of damage on average, but with damage variance increasing in that order.  See the table below.

Double red lightsabers are not randomly generated, but can be wished for.  They are two-handed, have a -4 to-hit penalty, and do an extra d9 damage against small monsters and d11 against large monsters (beyond the damage for a basic red lightsaber) when in double mode.

From [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/objects.c#line825]]:

{|class="wikitable"
! Color
! Small monster
! Large monster
|-
| green || 9 + d3 || 13 + d5
|-
| blue || 8 + d5 || 12 + d7
|-
| red || 6 + d9 || 10 + d11
|-
| red double (not implemented) || 6 + d9 + d9 || 10 + d11 + d11  (d15/d21) in double mode
|}

Lightsabers must be ignited in order to do full damage, so much of their usefulness is lost if they are allowed to run out of power.  They can be [[charging|recharged]] with a [[scroll of charging]].  Lightsabers recharge by the same rules as oil lamps: an uncursed scroll adds 750 turns and a blessed scroll adds 1500.  The total charge will never exceed a maximum of 1500 turns. Note that a cursed lightsaber won't ignite even if still charged, and will still weld to your hand should you wield it.

Lightsabers turn off automatically when they are unequipped, although if you are fast enough, you can dual-wield lightsabers, or even stick a lit one in your bag of holding!  Note that this ''currently'' does not damage your containers in any way.

All lightsabers are made of [[platinum]], except green lightsabers, which are made of [[plastic]].

====Enchantment====
Lightsabers can be enchanted like other weapon-tools.  This is important, since it can considerably help to offset the large to-hit penalty they will always carry, given that one can never become skilled in the use of a lightsaber.  To-hit and damage bonuses from enchantment do '''not''' apply when the lightsaber is not lit, so using a lightsaber for long periods of time is usually only practical if you have plentiful [[charging]].  The [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]] is best for this, though a [[magic marker]] (to write scrolls of charging) can also suffice if you don't need to write many other scrolls.

====Hits monsters as a +4 weapon====

SLASH'EM introduces a new property, the "[[Need +x weapon to hit]]".  This means that some monsters can only take damage from a weapon with an enchantment above a certain minimum.

Lightsabers can do damage to all monsters regardless of enchantment, charges or ignition.  A +0 lit lightsaber will damage [[Vecna]], but also a +0 uncharged one.  That an unlit lightsaber hits like a +4 weapon is probably a bug.

===Use as a tool===

Ignited lightsabers can be used to [[burn]] [[Elbereth]] and to burn through doors, statues and solid rock, in the manner of a [[pick-axe]] with the [[force]] command, making them invaluable, even when not used for combat.  Be careful: if you dig downwards with a lightsaber, you'll create a [[hole]] through the floor instead of a [[pit]], and fall through to the next level. You will only create a pit if you burn through a [[Grave|tomb]] on the floor.

==dNetHack==
The variant dNetHack also features lightsabers, which behave somewhat differently. dNethack has a variety of lightsaber types, including basic lightsabers, beamswords, double lightsabers, and Kamerel vajra.

All lightsabers must be lit to be fully effective.  While lit, most lightsabers are 3x damage melee weapons (surpassing almost all artifacts in terms of damage output), though vajra and some artifact lightsabers may be less powerful.  Lit lightsabers [[Shatter|sunder]] any weapon held by the target, and ignore equipped armor.  Lit lightsabers can cut through many terrain obstructions, included [[iron bar]]s, [[tree]]s, and [[drawbridge]]s (make sure to stand off to one side if using a lightsaber to cut through a drawbridge!).  Use #force and a direction to do so.  Notably, lightsabers are unable to cut through [[solid rock]] squares.  Finally, lit lightsabers allow you to escape from webs and beartraps without wasting a turn, and free you from pit traps while consuming only a single turn.

Falling down stairs while wielding a lit lightsaber is dangerous.  The character will attempt to switch off the lightsaber before coming into contact with it, with a luck and dex based chance of succeeding (Note that vajra and some artifact lightsabers can't be switched off!).  If the character does come into contact with the lightsaber, they take damage as if they had been struck by the saber.

Deactivated lightsabers are also useful weapons, though not nearly as powerful as when lit.  The precise effects vary between types of lightsaber, but all are more effective than bashing with an ordinary tool.

Lightsabers are charged weapons and will eventually run out of power.  They can be re-charged an unlimited number of times.  A single charging is good for 750 hits, or 1500 hits if blessed charging was used.  Just being lit also consumes charge, but at a much reduced rate.  100 turns of being lit consumes as much charge as a single hit.  Other activities consume charge as fast as combat.

Finally, there are special skills related to the propper use of lightsabers.  See the [[User:Chris/dNethack/Lightsaber_Forms|lightsaber forms]] page for details.

=== Lightsaber Colors ===
Basic, double lightsabers, and beamswords all have colored blades. A lightsaber's color is purely cosmetic, and can be changed by swapping out the focusing crystal.  To change the crystal, drop the lightsaber on the ground and #loot while standing over it.  [[Worthless glass]] gems produce 'red' blades, valuable gems produce other colors.  This can be used to informally id valuable [[gem]]s.

A table of the lightsaber colors, by gem:

{|class="prettytable"
! Gem !! Appearance 
|-
| magicite crystal||brilliant blue
|-
| dilithium crystal||twisting rainbow
|-
| diamond||coruscating white
|-
| star sapphire||star blue
|-
| ruby||ruby
|-

|-

|-
| black opal||smoke
|-

|-
| fluorite||white*
|-
| fluorite||green*
|-
| obsidian||gray
|-
| agate||orange
|-
| jade||jade
|-
| any worthless glass||red
|}

Note that no valuable gem gives a lightsaber color of red, and no two valuable gems have the same color.  Garnets are deep red and rubies are ruby-colored, so you can be certain any gem that yields a red lightsaber is worthless.

=== Lightsabers ===

{{weapon

[[Incantifier (starting race)|Incantifier]] [[Anachrononaut]]s start with a +3 lightsaber.

Lightsabers are one-handed weapons using the saber skill.  Lightsabers must be activated via [[apply]].  A lit lightsaber has a base damage of 1d8 to large and small targets, and therefore does 3d8 + 3xEnchantment damage on a hit.

When unlit, lightsaber hilts can be used as a martial-arts aid.  They deal 1d4+Enchantment damage to small and large targets, modifed by your unarmed fighting/martial arts skill bonus.  Note that this is inferior to the damage provided by dedicated martial-arts artifacts.  Most lightsaber hilts are silver, and so add the usual +1d20 silver damage vs. silver-hating targets.

'''Artifact lightsaber'''
The [[Annulus]] can be shifted into the form of a lightsaber, and this is the mode in which it is typically used.  While in this form, the Annulus can be applied a second time to ignite a second blade, making it a 6x overall weapon (though, the second blade is smaller and deals only 3d3+3xEnchantment damage).

Beamswords are one-handed weapons using the broadsword skill.  Beamswords must be activated via [[apply]].  A lit beamsword has a base damage of 1d10 to large and small targets, and therefore does 3d10+3xEnchantment damage on a hit.

When unlit, beamsword hilts can be used as a martial-arts aid.  They deal 1d4+Enchantment damage to small and large targets, modifed by your unarmed fighting/martial arts skill bonus.  Note that this is inferior to the damage provided by dedicated martial-arts artifacts.  Most beamsword hilts are made of gold, and so may add extra blessed or cursed damage to holy- or unholy-hating targets.

'''Artifact beamsword'''
The [[Atma Weapon]] is an artifact beamsword.  Because it runs off the life-force of the wielder, it is only a 2x damage weapon unless it is wielded by a non-drain resistant character.

}}

Double lightsabers also exist, and three of these are guaranteed in any Anachrononaut game.  One is placed on the locate level, one is placed on the goal level, and one on every lower filler level.  

Double lightsabers are two-handed weapons using the quarterstaff skill.  They must be activated via [[apply]], and can be activated a second time to ignite a second blade (a third apply deactivates both blades).  They deal 1d10 damage base to both small and large targets, and thus deal 3d10+3xEnchantment ''per blade'' (i.e., 6d10+6xEnchantment with both blades lit).

When unlit, double lightsaber hilts can be used as a martial-arts aid.  They deal 1d4+Enchantment damage to small and large targets, modifed by your unarmed fighting/martial arts skill bonus.  Note that this is inferior to the damage provided by dedicated martial-arts artifacts.  Most double lightsaber hilts are made from platinum, which doesn't have any special damage effects.

'''Artifact double lightsaber'''
[[Infinity's Mirrored Arc]] is an artifact double lightsaber.  Because it works by focusing ambient light into a blade, it is either lit or unlit, it can't be switched on and off and never runs out of charge.  Additionally, unless the wielder is standing in a lit square in range of an additional lightsource the Arc deals less than 3x damage.  A lit square alone results in a 2x blade, and a dark square in range of a light source results in a 1x blade.

=== Kamerel Vajra ===

{{weapon
 |color=gold color
 |name=kamerel vajra
 |appearance=short mace
 |smalldmg=1d6
 |largedmg=1d6
 |skill=mace
 |cost=800
 |weight=20
 |material=gold
}}

Kamerel vajra are one-handed weapons using the mace skill.  A vajra is either lit or unlit, it can't be switched on and off and never runs out of charge.  A lit vajra has a base damage of 1d6 to large and small targets, but has a variable damage multiplier and additional special effects.

If wielded by an [[Ara Kamerel]], a Kamerel Vajra is a 3x weapon and deals an additional 6d6 electrical damage (damaging wands as normal for electrical damage), for 9d6 + 3xEnchantment damage total vs. non-shock resistant targets and 3d6+3xEnchantment damage vs. shock resistant targets.  Additionally, the target is blinded for 1d50 turns.

If wielded by another creature, but while there is an Ara Kamerel present on the level (incarnate or unincarnate), a Kamerel Vajra is a 2x weapon and deals and additional 2d6 electrical damage (damaging wands 1/3rd of the time), for 4d6 + 2xEnchantment damage total vs. non-shock resistant targets and 2d6+2xEnchantment damage vs. shock resistant targets.  The target is still blinded for 1d50 turns.  In this case, the Kamerel Vajra counts as a lit lightsaber, and can be used with [[User:Chris/dNethack/Lightsaber Forms|lightsaber fighting forms]] (note that the player character never counts as an Ara Kamerel, and thus can't use vajras at full power).

If wielded by another creature without an Ara Kamerel on the level, a vajra is a 1d6 damage mace, dealing 1d6+Enchantment damage to large targets and 1d6+1+Enchantment damage to small ones.

There are no artifact vajra.

A koala poses no direct threat, possessing no physically damaging attacks of any sort.  Its calming touch will abort any active [[technique]]s, but is otherwise harmless.  However, other monsters affected by it will turn to peaceful (although some monsters may resist). It is thus a large threat to any pet, since a peaceful monster is no longer your pet, and some may be difficult to tame again, particularly [[polymorph]]ed pets. A pet koala, however, is very useful, since it can turn hostile monsters peaceful. They are quite slow and not overly strong, however. They can be tamed with [[Eucalyptus leaf|eucalyptus leaves]] and will not eat anything else.

A Tasmanian devil can eat organic items and engulf non-organic ones, much in the manner of a [[gelatinous cube]]. This is likely a reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Devil_(Looney_Tunes) Taz] from ''Looney Tunes''.

However, they have no [[magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]], making [[sleep]] a very valid option against them.

A '''rabid rabbit''' is a monster in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is a more dangerous variant of a [[rabbit]].

==Strategy==
These have a speed of 18, as well as a poisoned attack, making them very dangerous to a SLASH'EM character when they first start appearing. Unlike many monsters with a poisoned attack, they do not have poison resistance, which can be useful in light of the fact that SLASH'EM allows all edged weapons to be poisoned, either with a [[potion of sickness]] or a [[toilet]].  Make sure you have an backup plan handy when you face these, as they are much more dangerous than the typical [[rabid rat]].

{{wikipedia|Black rat}}

A black rat is a rat that appears only in the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Rat level|Rat King's level]].  Other than that it cannot be randomly generated, it is identical to the [[sewer rat]].  Possibly it exists so that it will be harder to pick out the [[pack rat|pack rats]] which can steal items on that level, as they are also represented by {{monsym|pack rat}}.

==Origin==

Black rats, or ''rattus rattus'', were once the most common rats in Europe.  While still common in warmer areas, in most of their previous habitats they have been displaced by the brown rat (''rattus norvegicus''), likely represented in Nethack by the sewer rat and/or the [[giant rat]].

A pack rat is a rodent appearing only on the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Rat level|Rat King's level]] in SLASH'EM.  It can steal items, but cannot teleport away like a [[nymph]], but rather attempts to run away like a [[monkey]].  Fortunately it is not very dangerous, having the same [[Monster level|level]] as a [[sewer rat]] (zero).  It can be hard to distinguish the pack rats among all the other rats on the Rat King's level, particularly since the [[black rat|black rats]] which also appear there share the same glyph.

==In real life==
Pack rats in real life are not true rats; rather, they are rat-like rodents known for burrowing in attics and stealing small items, particularly shiny ones.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Rats are long-tailed rodents.  They are aggressive,
omnivorous, and adaptable, often carrying diseases.
 
"The rat," said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible
audience, "although a rodent, is carnivorous.  You are aware
of that.  You will have heard of the things that happen in
the poor quarters of this town.  In some streets a woman dare
not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes.
The rats are certain to attack it.  Within quite a small time
they will strip it to the bones.  They also attack sick or
dying people.  They show astonishing intelligence in knowing
when a human being is helpless."
