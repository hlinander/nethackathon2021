From [[NetHack 3.0.0]] through [[3.0.10]], the Wizard is given a larger tower to occupy, and a [[vampire lord]] is generated within as an additional "roommate"; NetHack acquired color display in [[NetHack 3.0.4|version 3.0.4]]. Fake Wizard rooms had a randomly chosen [[demon prince]], and placed a [[demon lord]] instead if no prince was available; if all of the named demons are gone, a random demon is used instead. At the time, all eight modern named demons existed, but were only generated in these fake Wizard rooms or via summoning.

In [[NetHack 3.1.0]], the Amulet is given to the [[high priest]] of [[Moloch]], and the Wizard instead carries the [[Book of the Dead]]. The Wizard still lives in a 3.0.x-style Wizard room, and similar rooms exist on the first level of the Wizard's Tower and as part of the the two "[[Fake Wizard's Tower]]" levels; one of these levels contains a magic portal to the real tower.

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], if he appears within twelve turns after you perform the Invocation and you are on the Sanctum's floor, he will immediately warp into the Sanctum to obtain the Amulet from the high priest of Moloch (without damaging them, due to the aforementioned coding of his attacks).<ref name="mhitu"/>{{refsrc|spell.c|248}}{{refsrc|mhitm.c|1129}} This would allow him to bring the Amulet to you, thus circumventing the need to fight the high priest; it is no longer possible starting in [[NetHack 3.6.0]], as covetous monsters will not attack the priest, but is still relevant for [[#Variants|some 3.4.3-derived variants]].

Before [[NetHack 3.6.1]], your role's quest artifact is the only one eligible for the Wizard of Yendor to steal with his theft attack. In those versions, you can simply use another role's quest artifact to supply magic resistance and/or reflection while carrying your own in your on-hand container. Starting in 3.6.1, however, the Wizard can steal any role's quest artifact, so this tactic is no longer viable.

==Variants==
Quite a few later variants alter the Wizard of Yendor's stats and behavior in some manner.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], NetHack 3.4.3 rules for the Wizard of Yendor stealing quest artifacts apply. Additionally, there is a method of temporarily pacifying the Wizard exclusive to this variant - once you manage to drain enough levels from the Wizard that you can slime or polymorph him, hit his monster form with a [[potion of amnesia]]; this effect can be resisted dependent on his current form's monster MR.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], the Wizard of Yendor has an additional harassment effect outside the Astral Plane - a large earthquake will occur, similar to the effect of playing a [[drum of earthquake]].

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the Wizard of Yendor will not attack the [[Elder Priest]] carrying the Amulet of Yendor in Moloch's Sanctum. While the Wizard's harassment mechanics are unchanged, the pool of eligible nasties is expanded and includes incredibly dangerous monsters such as the [[bebelith]] and [[ancient naga]].

The Wizard's Amulet-stealing attack no longer targets quest artifacts, making them more reliable as sources of magic resistance both when fighting against him and on the ascension run. However, he is capable of casting nearly any monster spell available in dNetHack, and will do so {{frac|3|4}} of the time. The remaining {{frac|4}} of the time he will cast [[haste self]], Double Trouble, or another spell exclusive to him that forces an [[amulet of strangulation]] onto your neck, transforming your current amulet if necessary; magic resistance will prevent your amulet from being transformed, but does not protect you if you are not wearing one.

[[Illurien of the Myriad Glimpses]] is a unique monster that engages in very similar harassment to the Wizard after being killed for the first time.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the Wizard of Yendor is a far more powerful opponent that generates with his own inventory: his armor includes a [[robe]] and [[cornuthaum]], and he will have either an [[amulet of magic resistance]] or an [[amulet of guarding]] with equal chance. The Wizard also has his own weapon, with a {{frac|2|3}} chance of an [[athame]] and a {{frac|3}} chance of a [[quarterstaff]]; said weapon has a {{frac|2|3}} chance of generating with the fire [[object property]], a {{frac|6}} chance to generate with the frost property, and a {{frac|6}} to generate with the venom property. The Wizard's attack routine is upgraded as well: he has a 2d8 weapon attack in addition to the 2d12 Amulet-stealing attack, and can cast two monster spells per turn from both mage and clerical schools; this includes the various new spells added to the game such as [[acid blast]], [[lightning]] and [[Reflection (monster spell)|reflection]]. His glyph is also changed to {{brightmagenta|@}} in order to distinguish him from elven royals.

The potential amulet of magic resistance and the reflection spell means that death rays are no longer a surefire method to dispose of Rodney, and the added weapon attack and other tweaks to monster AI makes it possible for him to use quest artifact weapons and armor against you should he steal them. Furthermore, the new monsters added to EvilHack also mean that Double Trouble can result in the Wizard taking on very dangerous forms; a player facing the Wizard should be ready to dispatch him as quickly as possible without the use of a wand/finger of death (although it can still weaken him and drain his HP). However, he is markedly less cautious about warping away to heal compared to other covetous monsters, which the player can use to their advantage.

Similar to UnNetHack, the Wizard can also cause an earthquake as part of his harassment if you have the Amulet of Yendor in your possession.

{{encyclopedia|
No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so, spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who disturbs this mighty sorcerer!

&&%s&& %s Template talk:Item {3645 2006-06-09T11:20:05Z {396 Jayt} alternatives ==About probability==
The probability should be expressed in some other form than just a number like "42", like with the [[potion of object detection]]. What the heck does this tell anyone? 42 percent? Nope. The sum of probabilities of potions, for example, is 1000, so the probability for a potion to be object detection is 42/1000&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.042&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;4,2%, that is, four out of hundred potions are potions of object detection.

However, with rings, the sum of probabilities is 28, which happens to be the number of rings (omitting meat ring). Thus the probability for any kind of ring is 1/28&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.6%.

With wands the probabilities are something completely different again ("15" represents the probability of 6.8%). Thus, if the "probability" for a given item is x, there is actually no way of knowing whether the item is common or uncommon then, effectively rendering the probability number completely useless.  --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 23:27, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

'''grep''' is a [[Unix]] command-line tool to search in files using regular expression.

In ''[[NetHack]]'', most of the useful source is in src/*.c and include/*.h, thus you can grep the sources like this:

 $ '''cd ''/path/to/''nethack-3.4.3'''
 $ '''grep -n ''regular-expression'' */*.{c,h}'''

Here is an example of searching for "Drow" in an unbuilt copy of the ''[[SLASH'EM]]'' sources:

 $ '''cd ''/path/to/''slashem-0.0.7E7F2'''
 $ '''grep -n Drow */*.{c,h}'''
 src/u_init.c:1343:          /* Drows can recognize all droven objects */
 src/uhitm.c:40:/* Used to control whether Drow's sleep attack should succeed. */
 include/you.h:356:      /* KMH -- Drow is now its own role... */

It is sometimes useful to use grep to search for in-game messages. Want to know what a "wrenching sensation" is? Try this...

 $ '''cd ''/path/to/''nethack-3.4.3'''
 $ '''grep -n 'wrenching sensation' */*.{c,h}'''
 src/sit.c:248:                      You_feel("a wrenching sensation.");
 src/spell.c:116:                You_feel("a wrenching sensation.");
 src/teleport.c:847:             You_feel("a wrenching sensation.");
 src/teleport.c:869:         You_feel("a wrenching sensation.");

It can sometimes be difficult to find something successfully with grep. For example, a grep on <code>'You feel a wrenching sensation'</code> fails because NetHack uses the <code>You_feel</code> function for those messages.

Sometimes, the use of printf-style formatting also impedes your search. For example, suppose that [[you]] get the message ''"You feel that eating the little dog was a bad idea."''. You grep for it but get no results:

 $ '''grep -n 'eating the little dog' */*.{c,h}'''
 $

You suspect that the monster is variable. You try again, searching for "bad idea" somewhere in the same line after "eating":

 $ '''grep -n 'eating.*bad idea' */*.{c,h}'''
 src/eat.c:486:              You_feel("that eating the %s was a bad idea.", mons[pm].mname);
 $ 


You may also want to check in all files (including top-level ones:

 $ '''grep 'HACKDIR' $(find .)

A look around [[eat.c#line486]] (in [[vanilla]] 3.4.3) shows the following:

         switch(pm) {
             case PM_LITTLE_DOG:
             case PM_DOG:
             case PM_LARGE_DOG:
             case PM_KITTEN:
             case PM_HOUSECAT:
             case PM_LARGE_CAT:
                 if (!CANNIBAL_ALLOWED()) {
                     You_feel("that eating the %s was a bad idea.", mons[pm].mname);
                     HAggravate_monster |= FROMOUTSIDE;
                 }
                 break;

From this, you guess that message means that you now have the [[intrinsic]] of [[aggravate monster]], and that eating a [[little dog]], [[dog]], [[large dog]], [[kitten]], [[housecat]], or [[large cat]] causes it.

If you need to find in what file a certain function is defined, you can grep for the function name, prefixed with a caret, for example:

 $ '''grep ^delobj *.c'''
 invent.c:delobj(obj)
 $

 |name=trap door
 |color=brown
 |generation=levels with diggable floors, [[closet]]s, [[Castle]]
 |effect=Fall to lower level
}}

A '''trap door''' is a type of [[trap]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is somewhat identical to a [[hole]]: it drops any monster that steps on it to a deeper dungeon level, though it starts out hidden.

==Generation==
Trap doors can be randomly generated at any dungeon level, but cannot be generated randomly beneath [[boulder]]s or on levels with non-diggable floors such as the [[vibrating square]] level - the [[Castle]] has five statically placed trap doors that are the only entrances to the [[Valley of the Dead]]. If a trap door would be randomly generated on a level with a non-diggable floor, it is replaced with a [[falling rock trap]].

Trap doors are sometimes found in closets, with the [[engraving]] "[[Vlad]] was here" in front of the door.

If you [[kick]] a [[throne]] and do not destroy it or knock loose treasure, there is a {{frac|4}} chance of a trap door suddenly appearing; it cannot be triggered any other way, and will close up as soon as you land.

==Description==
{{main|Hole#Effects|l1=Hole § Effects}}
[[You]] or another monster that steps on a trap door will fall at least one dungeon level.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|1292|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/trap.c|2478|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} As with holes, there is no upper limit, and you cannot fall beyond the Castle. It is common to fall 2 or 3 floors if you trigger a trap door, while monsters never fall more than one floor.{{refsrc|include/trap.h|87|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/teleport.h|1363|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} [[Pet]]s and monsters with the [[follower]] attribute that are on an adjacent square when you fall through a trap door will follow you down to whatever floor you land on.

[[Pet]]s that fall through a trap door while [[leash]]ed lose a point of [[tameness]], and the leash is removed. Monsters that [[levitate]], [[fly]] or are at least huge [[size]] cannot fall through trap doors, including you if you are levitating or in an applicable monster form - while flying above a trap door, you can press {{kbd|>}} to swoop down through it.

Zapping a [[wand of opening]] or the [[spell of knock]] at a trap door's position will trigger the trap and reveal it.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2494|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Zapping a [[wand of locking]] or the [[spell of wizard lock]] at a hole will turn it into a trap door.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2909|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Zapping a [[wand of striking]] at a trap door below you will destroy it and turn it into a hole.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2894|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Removal==
A trap door can be removed by pushing a [[boulder]] into it, or by zapping a wand of locking or the wizard lock spell at it.

==Strategy==
Known trap doors can be a useful escape for you in a pinch.

==History==
Trap doors first appear in [[Hack 1.0]].

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], earlier versions and some variants based on those versions, plugging all of the Castle trap doors is a [[bad idea]], as the only other way to access the Valley of the Dead is via [[branchport]] or a [[levelport]] with [[teleport control]]; in the event plugging them is deemed necessary, players would always leave at least one open. As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the squares containing the trap doors can be dug out if they are filled.

The ability to fly freely down trap doors was added in [[NetHack 3.6.4]].

==Messages==
{{message|A trap door opens up under you!|You activated a trap door.}}
{{message|Some dust swirls beneath you.|An unseen hole was transformed into a trap door.}}
{{message|The trapdoor beneath you shatters.|You destroyed a trap door with a wand of striking, turning it into a hole.}}

{{message|You fall down a shaft!|You fell 2 levels.}}
{{message|You fall down a deep shaft!|You fell 3 levels.}}
{{message|You fall down a very deep shaft!|You fell 4+ levels.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], an [[Archeologist]] [[wield]]ing a bullwhip will not fall through trap doors, though objects on that square may still fall through.{{refsrc|trap.c|359|version=SLASH'EM_0.0.7E7F2}}

====Messages====
{{message|But thanks to your trusty whip ... You don't fall in.|A trap door opened under you, but you were an Archeologist wielding a bullwhip, preventing you from falling through.}}

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], [[Castle (UnNetHack)|the new Castle layouts]] have different trap door counts and placements: nine trap doors appear on the "island" map, while three appear on the "river" map.

===EvilHack===
[[EvilHack]] uses the same possible layouts for the Castle as UnNetHack above, though the river of water in the second map is replaced by [[lava]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
I knew my Erik too well to feel at all comfortable on jumping into his house.  I knew what he had made of a certain palace at Mazenderan.  From being the most honest building conceivable, he soon turned it into a house of the very devil, where you could not utter a word but it was overheard or repeated by an echo. With his trap-doors the monster was responsible for endless tragedies of all kinds.

 |type=non-directional

}}

The '''wand of light''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''

== Generation ==

There is a 9.5% chance that a randomly-generated wand will be a wand of light, making it the most commonly generated wand.

== Effects ==

When zapped or engraved with, the wand [[light]]s an area with radius of 5, or the whole room if on the [[Rogue level]].

{{lightradius|r=5}}

Like other wands, [[apply]]ing a wand of light will break it, resulting in an explosion dealing 1 to (4''n'') damage, with the hero being blinded for (''n''+1)d25 turns, with ''n'' being the number of remaining charges. The same area is lit as when the wand is zapped; surrounding monsters may also be blinded, and [[gremlin]]s take damage.

==Strategy==
In the early game, a wand of light may be useful to help mapping unlit floors of the [[Gnomish Mines]]. Certain [[quest]] levels also have large unlit sections, where it may be useful to mark where the player has been (though there is an option to make this redundant). It can also aid in [[jumping]] to get away from dangerous situations if you have no [[lamp]].

Some players use a wand of light to mark the location of the [[Vibrating square]] and light paths between staircases in Gehennom; this will be a great help if you happen to [[Mind flayer|get]] [[Scroll of amnesia|amnesia]], but is probably not worth the effort in most cases.

Once you obtain and can reliably cast the {{spell of|light}} spell, the wand of light becomes practically useless unless you are constantly low on [[energy]], and is superseded by the spell for all of the above usages. The wand is good [[polyfodder]] at this point, as it is usually generated with a lot of charges.

==Variants==
===Sporkhack===
In [[Sporkhack]], wands of light blind nearby creatures when engraving or zapping with them. Be wary of using them close to [[aligned priests]] or the [[Minetown]] [[watch]].

}}
The '''chameleon''', {{monsym|chameleon}}, is the most common and well-known of the [[shapeshifter]]s in ''[[NetHack]]''. They have a 1/6 chance per turn of changing forms: chameleons will change into an [[animal]] 2/3 of the time, and a random monster the rest of the time.

[[Eating]] a chameleon [[corpse]] causes [[polymorph]]ing, but is negated by [[unchanging]].

==Generation==
Several chameleons are guaranteed to appear on the home level of the [[Rogue quest]].

==Strategy==
Chameleons are quite capable of imitating [[summon nasties|summonable "nasties"]], most infamously [[arch-liches]]; many of the other possible forms can also spell death for the unprepared. They should therefore be treated with caution, and dealt with quickly whenever possible. Wearing a [[ring of protection from shape changers]] or [[canceling]] them will revert them to their much easier base form, which can only do 8 damage at most by biting.

As carnivorous pets eating a chameleon corpse may likely polymorph them into something useless, try to avoid leaving said pets (especially [[purple worm]]s) near chameleons. It also pays to mind the corpses monsters leave, as eating a chameleon corpse yourself without realizing it will most likely cause a lot of misery, especially for your [[armor]].

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Pets will no longer eat shapeshifter corpses unless they are starving or on the verge of untaming.}}

A chameleon in the form of a [[domestic animal]] can be tamed with the appropriate food, and will remain tame even as it changes forms. Unfortunately, it is very likely to polymorph into a weak form and die, and it cannot be predicted when it will change into something useful. You can improve it, however, by displacing it onto a [[polytrap]] while wearing a [[ring of protection from shape changers]].

==SLASH'EM==
Because polymorphed monsters return to their natural form upon death, pet chameleons are much more useful; while they can still die in their chameleon form, dying or self-destructing while polymorphed will allow them to shapeshift again eventually, and there is more value in their more powerful forms as a result.
{{todo|More variant info on chameleons.}}

==Origin==
The chameleon is a real-life animal noted for its camouflaging abilities that it uses to hide itself from prey and predators alike. In some fantasy works, such as the ''Xanth'' series from which the [[encyclopedia]] entry originates, this is extended to full-on shapeshifting.

could strike him, he would be horribly dead.

::''Fire is also the [[neutral]] [[god]] in the [[flame mage]] pantheon in [[SLASH'EM]].

In addition to harming the player and monsters, '''fire''' in NetHack can damage items.  Fire damage comes from the following sources:

* Fire [[ray]]s
** Zapped [[wand of fire]]
** Blown [[fire horn]]
** Fire [[breath]] of a [[red dragon]], [[red naga]], [[hell hound]] ([[hell hound pup|pup]]), or the [[Chromatic Dragon]]
* [[Fireball]]s and fiery [[explosion]]s
** Broken wand of fire
** [[Spellbook of fireball|Spell of fireball]]
** Attempting to refill an [[oil lamp]] while it is lit
** [[Grenade|Frag grenades]] in [[SLASH'EM]]
** Zapped or broken [[wand of fireball]] in SLASH'EM
* [[Fire trap|Towers of flame]]
** Read [[scroll of fire]] (described as a tower of flame, but behaves like a 3x3 explosion)
** The [[fire pillar]] [[monster spell]]
** [[Fire trap]]s
** One effect of [[magic trap]]s
** One type of [[container trap]]
* [[Melee]] attacks of a [[fire ant]], a [[fire elemental]], or a [[salamander]]
* [[Explosion attack]] of a [[flaming sphere]]
* [[Passive attack]] of a [[red mold]], a [[fire elemental]], or a [[fire vortex]]
* [[Gaze]] attack of a [[pyrolisk]]
* [[Holding attack]] of a salamander
* [[Engulf]]ing attack of a [[steam vortex]] or a fire vortex
* Bonus damage of the [[artifact]] [[Fire Brand]]
* Contact with [[lava]]
* A thrown or drunk '''lit''' [[potion of oil]]

Fire is also mentioned in the following places:
* The [[Plane of Fire]] is the third of the [[Elemental Planes]].
* Accepted [[sacrifice]]s on a neutral or chaotic [[altar]] explode in a "burst of flame".  This fire is cosmetic and does not interact with [[you]], so there is no damage to you or to your inventory.


==Effects==
Fire burns [[organic]] material and boils liquids.  Fire attacks are likely to [[erode|damage]] worn armor made of [[cloth]], [[leather]], or [[wood]] (such as [[shirt]]s, [[cloak]]s, and [[shield]]s), and destroy [[scroll]]s, [[spellbook]]s, and [[potion]]s.  The [[scroll of fire]] is an exception: it will never be destroyed by fire attacks.

Fire rays and explosions may boil away [[pool]]s of water in the dungeon, leaving behind [[pit]]s.  This only applies to water in "pools"; "moats" and "water" tiles are unaffected.  For more information on the distinction between these types of terrain, see [[Moat#Pool vs. moat vs. water]].

Fire damage cures [[sliming]] by burning away the affected tissue.  This will still cost hit points if you are not [[fire resistant]], but will still cure you even if you are resistant.

=== Messages ===
{{message|One of your <color> potions <of type> boils and explodes!|You were struck by fire damage and one of your potions has boiled.}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Fire now lights candles, lamps and potions of oil. The [[Candelabrum of Invocation]] is not affected.}}

==Fire protection==
Damage to yourself or your inventory can be prevented or minimized by the following:
* '''Resistance''': Intrinsic or extrinsic [[fire resistance]] prevents or reduces hit point loss from fire attacks.  It does not prevent erosion of worn equipment or destruction of items in your main inventory.
* '''Reflection''': Fire [[ray]]s and [[breath]] attacks can be [[reflection|reflected]], preventing damage to yourself and your items. Nondirectional attacks (melee, passive attacks, explosions) cannot.
* '''Containers''': Items in [[container]]s are safe from fire damage.
* '''Fireproofing''': Armor made of [[cloth]], [[leather]], or [[wood]] can be [[fireproof]]ed, protecting it from damage from fire.  Fireproof armor does not prevent fire damage to the player, except in [[Lava#Crossing Lava|one case]].  It is possible to get fireproof scrolls, potions, and spellbooks by [[wish]]ing, but this is probably impractical.
* '''Magic cancellation''': High [[MC]] can protect your inventory from melee fire attacks. It does not prevent damage from passive or engulfing fire attacks, or from [[explosion]]s or ray attacks.

==Trivia==
Since fire attacks in NetHack [[Source:Mondata.c#on_fire|are said to melt]] a [[glass golem]], we can deduce that the temperature of fire is at least 1600 degrees C, or 2900 degrees F.

==SLASH'EM==
* features the new [[role]] of [[Flame Mage]] and the artifact [[athame]] named [[Firewall]], which deals fire damage.
* The following SLASH'EM [[monster (SLASH'EM)|monsters]] have fire attacks: [[lava blob]]s, [[hellcat]]s, [[hellrat]]s, [[movanic deva]]s, [[hellbat]]s, [[fire vampire]]s, [[wax golem]]s, [[ruby golem]]s, and [[crystal golem]]s.

A '''rothe''' is one of the deadlier early-game monsters. They have many attacks and often appear in packs, somewhat similar to [[soldier ant]]s.

==Appearance==
They resemble musk oxen or like an imposing woolly ox/bull. They aren't rodents.

== Strategy ==
* Fortunately, rothes are larger and move slower than ants, making them far more susceptible to [[wand]]s.
* Rothes respect [[Elbereth]].
* Rothes only provide 100 nutrition, but appear in groups, so they make a good source of food.
* They also frequently leave corpses, which makes them good sacrifice fodder.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
The rothe (pronounced roth-AY) is a musk ox-like creature with
an aversion to light.  It prefers to live underground near
lichen and moss.

'''Barbarians''' are strong [[melee]] fighters who start the game with [[poison resistance]]. Because barbarians can fight their way through situations that would kill other players, and because they need not worry about [[poison]], they are one of the [[Role difficulty|easier roles]] for a new player. When a barbarian starts the game with a dog, the dog is always named Idefix, assuming naming [[options]] are unchanged. The barbarian's attack messages replace most instances of "hit" with "smite" (e.g. "You smite the goblin!"), but this is flavor text with no gameplay effect.

Barbarians can be either [[neutral]] or [[chaotic]], and can be either [[Human (starting race)|humans]] or [[Orc (starting race)|orcs]]. Their first [[Sacrifice#Gifts|sacrifice gift]] is [[Cleaver]]. According to the [[guidebook]]:

          Barbarians  are  warriors out of the hinterland, hardened to 
          battle.   They  begin  their  quests  with  naught  but  uncommon 
          strength, a trusty hauberk, and a great two-handed sword.


== Starting inventory ==
Each barbarian starts with the following:{{refsrc|u_init.c|40|nethack=3.6.0}}{{refsrc|u_init.c|673|nethack=3.6.0}}
* Either of these cases (50% chance each):
** a +0 [[two-handed sword]] and a +0 [[axe]]
** a +0 [[battle-axe]] and a +0 [[short sword]] ([[orcish short sword]] for orcs)
* a +0 [[ring mail]] ([[orcish ring mail]] for orcs)
* a [[food ration]] (with the usual {{frac|6}} chance of getting a stack of 2)
* if an orc, two more random [[food]]-class items (each of which also may be a stack of 2)
* an [[oil lamp]] ({{frac|6}} chance){{refsrc|u_init.c|679|nethack=3.6.0}}

== Intrinsics ==
Barbarians gain intrinsics at these [[experience level]]s:{{refsrc|attrib.c|27|nethack=3.6.0}}
* Level 1: [[poison resistance]]
* Level 7: [[speed]]
* Level 15: [[stealth]]

== Skills ==
{{Barbarian skill table}}

Barbarians start with ''Basic'' skill in ''Axe'', ''Bare hands'', and the skill for their sword (short or two-handed).

== Strategy ==
===Character creation===
Being an orc is of little benefit to a Barbarian: their poison resistance is redundant, and safe [[cannibalism]] doesn't factor in much since orcish corpses are far more common than human ones in the early game - this ''does'' become a factor for early [[sacrifice]]s, since it allows them to convert [[altar]]s and raise [[Luck]] much easier than their human counterpart. However, late-game orcs are also held back by their inability to exceed 18/50 [[strength]] without [[gauntlets of power]]. 

The human lack of [[infravision]] is less of an issue than with other roles, since Barbarians have relatively less access to ranged weapons, and almost no Barbarian will opt for spellcasting so early on (if at all). However, if you do wish to develop a ranged attack, orcish Barbarians may have the best option due to their +1 [[multishot]] bonus from using an [[orcish bow]] and [[orcish arrow]]s.

Chaotic characters can decrease prayer timeout more quickly through sacrifice, have a more merciful [[mysterious force]], and can commit [[murder]] without major penalties if necessary. Outside of the guaranteed sacrifice gift, neutral Barbarians arguably have access to somewhat better artifacts.

===Early game===
====Weapons====
Most Barbarians should seek out [[Cleaver]], an artifact [[battle-axe]] and their first [[sacrifice gift]], as soon as possible. Cleaver's ability to slice through multiple foes as of [[3.6.1]] will provide a well-needed early boon for dealing with early groups, such as [[giant ant]]s and [[hill orc]] hordes. Until Cleaver is obtained, you should use the starting two-handed sword or battle-axe.

====Armor====
The starting [[ring mail]] should be replaced with any other metal armor, preferably an an [[Elven mithril coat|elven]] or [[dwarvish mithril-coat]].  The barbarian's combat capabilities make the [[Gnomish Mines]] a viable choice to visit early, as they are likely to come across dwarven armor to [[Pet#Cursed items|pet test]].

====General====
While barbarians overall should have no trouble dishing out damage, players should be wary not to lean too much on their health and armor to carry them through every fight. The intrinsic poison resistance that barbarians start with widens the list of edible corpses that can be eaten in lieu of permafood. Orcish barbarians find the poison resistance redundant, but will appreciate the additional lack of penalties for [[cannibalism]], and [[infravision]] for the Gnomish Mines. For chaotics, orcish barbarians will also have an easier time converting early altars than their human counterparts due to the earlier presence of same-race monsters. Human barbarians can still make use of [[werecreature]] corpses or human corpses dropped by [[human zombie|zombie]]s or [[human mummy|mummies]].

===Mid game===
====Objectives====
The [[barbarian quest]] is not especially difficult, though there are some significant wrinkles. While the monster generation is biased towards ogres, it may also contain a very large number of [[troll]]s, which can be the biggest hazard for an underleveled or under-prepared barbarian. If enough trolls are present, they can form an almost perpetual swarm around the player as they rise from the dead faster than they can be permanently disposed of. A [[tinning kit]] can be extremely helpful in this situation, as can a wielded [[footrice]] corpse; a corpse-eating [[pet]] is another option. As a last resort, you can [[follower|lure]] one or two trolls at a time from [[Thoth Amon]]'s lair to the previous level and dispatch them there. This gets the trolls off your back and eventually leaves you free to kill all the ogres and Thoth Amon.

There is also the notable lack of incentive presented by the [[quest artifact]]: [[The Heart of Ahriman]], infamously regarded as one of the most useless quest artifacts. Its base item is a [[luckstone]], but another luckstone is guaranteed at [[Mines' End]]; it provides [[stealth]] for a class that obtains the intrinsic at XL 15 (one level after the quest even becomes an option). Barbarians can #[[invoke]] it for levitation, but this particularly quirky method is only slightly preferable to the [[potion of levitation]], and much less desirable than that provided by other means, such as a [[ring of levitation]] - however, it does let you levitate a non-flying steed while riding it.

Trolls and ogres are eligible for high level offensive items, such as the [[wand of lightning]] or the [[wand of death]]. Careful players will want to postpone the quest until after obtaining magic resistance or reflection.

Since the [[Bell of Opening]] is required for the [[Invocation]], a player may be inclined to leave the quest until later on and retrieve the Bell once they are otherwise ready to perform it; on the other hand, the Bell is also a viable alternative if they are lacking a [[silver]] weapon, such as a [[silver spear]] or [[silver saber]], for the [[shade]]s in [[Orcus-town]].

===Late game===
====Weapons====
Cleaver becomes a risky weapon to carry into the lowest floors and beyond, since if it becomes cursed, it will leave you with no hands free to get it uncursed. [[Prayer]] is a workable strategy in the upper dungeon, but this is no longer available in [[Gehennom]], and the pace of the endgame is too hectic to rely on being able to pray. [[Genocide|Genociding]] [[lich]]es and keeping Cleaver blessed will greatly reduce the danger of it becoming cursed. A solution is to [[sacrifice]] for more gifts until you receive a good artifact weapon such as [[Frost Brand]], [[Stormbringer]], or [[Vorpal Blade]] and twoweapon it with a [[silver spear]] or [[silver saber]].

==== Spellcasting ====
Barbarians have the highest spellcasting penalty in the game. Without a [[robe]], it is impossible for them to cast any spell other than their special spell, [[haste self]], at lower than 66% fail (67% without [[helm of brilliance]]). Even haste self will cap at 30% fail (31% without helm of brilliance, 34% if Escape is left at Unskilled). Spellcasting is essentially out of the question until the Barbarian can manage to find a robe, but once they locate one they might be able to make use of some low level non-combat spells.

====General====
Neutral barbarians who are not averse to wishing for quest artifacts may find [[The Orb of Fate]] a worthwhile use of a [[wish]]. The Orb provides valuable enhancements to a combat-reliant character, confering half physical damage and half spell damage, as well as doing a number of other useful things. It is, in short, everything that [[the Heart of Ahriman]] isn't (including ''very'' heavy&mdash;a significant downside factor). Chaotic barbarians, on the other hand, would likely prefer [[The Master Key of Thievery]] due to its half physical damage and other effects, though it unfortunately does not offer the half spell damage that the Orb does.

==Rank titles==

The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1&ndash;2: Plunderer/Plunderess
*XL 3&ndash;5: Pillager
*XL 6&ndash;9: Bandit
*XL 10&ndash;13: Brigand
*XL 14&ndash;17: Raider
*XL 18&ndash;21: Reaver
*XL 22&ndash;25: Slayer
*XL 26&ndash;29: Chieftain/Chieftainess
*XL 30: Conqueror/Conqueress

== Variants ==

=== SLASH'EM ===
Barbarians can expect to be overcharged in SLASH'EM's shops, by a factor of 3. This, combined with barbarians' low charisma, makes many items (in particular the now 1000[[zm]] base-cost [[magic lamp]]) nigh-unaffordable, forcing barbarians to resort to other means, such as their second sacrifice gift (see below).

In addition to Cleaver, barbarians get [[Deathsword]] as their second sacrifice gift; it is a chaotic [[two-handed sword]] with +5 to hit and +14 to damage against humans. This can be useful for [[murdering]] shopkeepers and aligned priests, it can also be useful against [[Werecreature (SLASH'EM)|werecreatures]] and for cleaning out [[barracks]]. Other significant targets are [[Thoth Amon]], the [[Wizard of Yendor]], and the [[high priest of Moloch]] as well as his attendant [[aligned priest]]s. Since it is such a specialty weapon, you won't likely want to waste any skill points on two-handed sword.

Unfortunately, the fact is that barbarians' first two guaranteed sacrifice gifts both become outclassed by SLASH'EM's mid-game, and approach obsolescence by its endgame. A barbarian can either expect to have more of a challenge fighting monsters, to do a lot of sacrificing, to spend a wish or two, or to be crowned to get [[Stormbringer]] or [[Vorpal Blade]], which are both respectable weapons in SLASH'EM&mdash;Vorpal Blade has had its chance of beheading doubled to 10%. It goes without saying that many spoiled chaotic barbarians will try for the infamous [[Bat from Hell]], but the old favorites from vanilla remain good choices.

Spears are much more common in SLASH'EM, making them a more viable distance weapon if you don't mind the weight, which barbarians should be able to carry.

A [[drow|droven]] barbarian is an easy race-role combination for [[SLASH'EM]] players. At the start of the game, a droven barbarian should immediately unwield the weapon ({{kbd|w}}{{kbd|-}}) and fight bare-handed. This gains access to the drow's ''very useful'' melee sleep attack, an immense help for the difficult melee environment at the start of SLASH'EM. The ability to repeatedly put your opponent to sleep should compensate for bare hands doing less damage than good weapons! To train your axe skill, wield your axe or battle-axe against monsters with [[sleep resistance]]. Eventually, you will be fighting primarily with [[Cleaver]], alternating to bare-handed only when you need it. Drow cannot two-weapon, but fighting bare-handed should more than offset that.

=== UnNetHack ===

In [[UnNetHack]], [[the Heart of Ahriman]] gives its owner [[displacement]] instead of [[stealth]]. Considering that Barbarians acquire intrinsic stealth at level 15, this makes the Heart a more desirable acquisition. 

In addition to [[Human]] and [[Orc]], [[UnNetHack]] also offers [[Vampire]] as a starting race for Barbarians.

=== dNethack ===

The Heart of Ahriman now grants MR, reflection, half-spell damage, drain resistance, fire resistance and poison resistance while carried, and #invokes for blessed remove curse. This makes uncursing your weapon a tad easier, so barbarians can possibly wield Cleaver late in the game.

=== SpliceHack ===

The starting weapon sets for Barbarians in SpliceHack are one of:

* +0 battle-axe and +0 short sword
* +0 falchion and +0 [[scimitar]]

The falchion is a two-handed scimitar. SpliceHack Barbarians can reach expert skill in scimitar.

SpliceHack Barbarians also have access to the [[Skills (SpliceHack)#Blood rage|blood rage skill]], which boosts damage when the player has low health.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
They dressed alike -- in buckskin boots, leathern breeks and deerskin shirts, with broad girdles that held axes and short swords; and they were all gaunt and scarred and hard-eyed; sinewy and taciturn.
They were wild men, of a sort, yet there was still a wide gulf between them and the Cimmerian.  They were sons of civilization, reverted to a semi-barbarism.  He was a barbarian of a thousand generations of barbarians.  They had acquired stealth and craft, but he had been born to these things.  He excelled them even in lithe economy of motion.
They were wolves, but he was a tiger.

&&%s&& %s Ranger {148983 2022-11-01T18:17:41Z {187 Darth l33t} /* Special rules */ upcoming {{wikipedia|Ranger (character class)}}
The '''ranger''' is one of the player [[role]]s in NetHack. Rangers can be either [[neutral]] or [[chaotic]], and can be [[human (starting race)|humans]], [[elf (starting race)|elves]], [[gnome (starting race)|gnomes]], or [[orc (starting race)|orcs]].

Rangers can get expert in [[dagger]], [[sling]], [[dart]], [[boomerang]], [[spear]], [[bow]] and [[crossbow]], and also in [[divination spells]]. Rangers cannot use [[two-weapon combat]].

The [[guidebook]] entry for the ranger has this to say about them:
 Rangers are most at home in the woods, and some say slightly
          out of place in a dungeon.  They are, however, experts in archery
          as well as tracking and stealthy movement.

==Starting equipment==
A Ranger's starting equipment depends heavily on their [[race]]:

A chaotic Ranger, regardless of race, has a 1% chance each of their primary and secondary ammo stacks being [[poison]]ed.

==Intrinsics==
*Exp Level 1: [[automatic searching|searching]]
*Exp Level 7: [[stealth]]
*Exp Level 15: [[see invisible]]

==Skills==
{{Ranger skill table}}
Rangers start with ''Basic'' skill in ''Dagger'' and the category of their starting launcher (either ''Bow'' or ''Crossbow'').

==Special rules==
Rangers have a role bonus for [[multishot]] which applies to stackable ranged weapons ''except'' [[daggers]]. Skill and racial bonuses apply as normal.

Rangers have a bonus to their chance of [[untrap|disarming]] floor [[trap]]s.

Rangers have a +2 ''penalty'' with [[emergency spell]]s.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Rangers always succeed in disarming bear traps, unless impaired. ({{commit|e4cb3f083251cce903a6a6a80c607aba9f67db4f}})

Rangers get a multishot bonus when wielding [[the Longbow of Diana]].}}

==Strategy==
===Character creation===
A Ranger has many options during character creation, with difficult tradeoffs for each:
* Humans have the most [[HP]] growth, and are the only race that can reach the maximum [[strength]] damage bonus without [[gauntlets of power]]. This becomes useful around the mid-game if you find it cumbersome to swap back and forth between your melee weapon and [[launcher]], and want to switch to darts. On the downside, you have no racial multishot bonus, and the lack of [[infravision]] hurts your ranged combat until you gain extrinsic [[telepathy]] from your Quest artifact.
* Gnomes are the only race to enjoy a relatively peaceful [[Mines]]. As a Ranger, you're likely to want to tackle the Mines early to find armor and claim the [[luckstone]] to make ranged combat more reliable, so this is a strong advantage. However, your starting crossbow imposes a multishot penalty until you have 16 strength. There's a chance you'll start with that much, but 14 or 15 is more likely, and even lower values are possible. Engaging in melee combat when it's safe to do so, and pushing [[boulder]]s in [[Sokoban]], should eventually make up the deficit. The gnomes in the Mines and the centaurs on your Quest should supply all the bolts you'll need for the rest of the game, whereas orcs and elves often need to ration their racial missiles.
* Orcs have the poorest-quality missiles and lose their racial multishot bonus if they switch to better ones. Orcish starting food is generally inferior, forcing them to dive for food more quickly than other Rangers; the starting tripe rations are probably best used for training [[apport]] rather than consumption, although pets and a ranged game often do not mesh well. On the other hand, you can obtain pre-poisoned orcish arrows from hostile orcs, giving you a means to inflict [[instadeath]] on a threatening monster; poison resistance is also a general early-game boon, e.g when [[untrap]]ping [[dart trap]]s for their missiles.
* Elves have the best starting missiles when you include the racial damage bonus, and enjoy a total +2 to-hit bonus when firing them. Elven arrows are also inherently protected from [[rust monster]]s and the various acidic blobs and jellies in the early game, although [[gelatinous cube]]s can eat them. However, since elven monsters are always peaceful to you, they never spawn in groups, so lost elven arrows are difficult to replace. You can immediately turn your elven dagger into [[Sting]] if you wish, and your starting lembas wafers alone will last you thousands of turns, letting you play more slowly and methodically than other races. Elven disadvantages mostly show in the late game, when you'll need [[gauntlets of power]] to reach maximum strength and [[encumbrance]] (which in turn gives a -2 to-hit penalty when used with bows), and your lower [[constitution]] penalizes your HP and its recovery.
* As a neutral character, you're more likely than a chaotic one to receive a useful [[sacrifice gift]]. An elf can force [[Stormbringer]] as their first gift by naming Sting and [[Orcrist]] beforehand; while not likely to quickly receive a second gift with three artifacts generated, Stormbringer ''can'' prove sufficient enough. Chaotics have the usual advantage of a more merciful [[mysterious force]].

===Early game===
====Objectives====
If you're not a gnome, the Mines will be fairly dangerous. However the resident gnomes and dwarves will have plenty of ranged weapons and armor that you might want. It will be hard to attack enemies from a distance on dark levels, especially for players without [[infravision]].

It is important to remember that enchanted arrows and arrows which have been blessed break less often than other arrows. High Luck substantially reduces breakage of blessed projectiles, so a [[luckstone]] is essential for long term arrow use. With high Luck and blessed arrows enchanted to +2 or higher, arrows [[Projectile#Breakage|break]] only very rarely: less than 1 in 200 hits. This makes Mines' End a very important destination, and obtaining [[holy water]] a high priority.

====Weapons====
Accumulate a stack of daggers to save your arrows from breaking. You can discard these after you have a large stack of blessed, +6 or +7 arrows.

Use your +2 arrows first; not only do they do more damage, but they are less likely to break (uncursed +2 arrows breakage rate is 25%, while +0 is 67%).  Note that while arrows are made of metal (which can corrode), elven arrows are made of wood, so regardless of strategy, it's a good idea to keep a few elven arrows to dispatch acidic monsters and rust monsters. Elven rangers have the advantage of having such arrows from the start of the game.

Consider poisoning your arrows by dipping them in a potion of sickness. This will cause d6 damage and will instantly kill 10% of the time if your target is not poison resistant. Some will become unpoisoned, however, giving you two stacks of arrows, some poisoned and some not. Use the unpoisoned arrows when attacking targets which are not vulnerable to poison. When you intend to enchant your arrows further (or most of your arrows have become unpoisoned), poison the unpoisoned arrows and put them back into the quiver. Note that getting potions of sickness is not difficult; 1/4 of random [[alchemy]] results become sickness, so dipping a couple of random potions together should get you a potion of sickness.

You can acquire more arrows from dead bodies or by untrapping arrow traps.

Keep in mind that Rangers can throw or fire up to 4 [[ranged weapon]]s at once (except for daggers) giving them on an average 2.5 times the damage as the same weapon in [[melee]]. Unskilled or Basic skill can randomly hurl up to 1 extra weapon, 2 extra for Skilled and 3 for Expert. See [[multishot]] for details.

====Armor====
Rangers are extremely unlikely to cast spells in the early game, so metallic armor is fine.
====General====
A good strategy is to maintain a distance from opponents: most monsters are much poorer at ranged combat than a starting Ranger. Humans, Gnomes and Orcs start with a [[cloak of displacement]] which helps with this strategy.

Levitating while firing your arrows or daggers will make you fire only one missile. Also, you are paralyzed when you [[hurtle]] in the opposite direction from your shot; this lasts at least as long as you would take walking, so this is a dangerous way to run away.

===Mid game===
====Objectives====
The Quest is a bit tough, and the reward is not too great. [[The Longbow of Diana]] provides reflection, but you will want an alternate source of reflection before going on the Quest anyway, to defend against the large number of centaurs armed with wands, and it lacks the racial multishot bonus that non-human rangers enjoy. However, it does provide telepathy when carried in open inventory and gives the Wizard something else to steal (a quest artifact) other than the Amulet of Yendor.

====Weapons====
You can get several hundred arrows from the first level of the Ranger quest off of dead centaurs and untrapping the two arrow traps before the quest boss' lair. Also, the Ranger quest artifact, [[The Longbow of Diana]], can be invoked to summon arrows of its corresponding blessed/cursed status.  If you prefer to use a crossbow as your primary ranged weapon (likely for the multishot bonus as a gnome), you can also get a few hundred crossbow bolts from the plains and mountain centaurs in the quest.

If you have [[skill slot]]s to spare, consider switching to [[dart]]s as your primary ranged weapon.  They are as lightweight and plentiful as arrows, don't require a [[wield]]ed launcher, and despite their low base damage benefit from high [[Strength]], unlike arrows or bolts: at a Strength of 18 darts do as much damage as [[elven arrow]]s, and with 25 Strength from [[gauntlets of power]], each dart will deal an additional 4 damage over that.  The only downsides are a lack of [[silver damage]] and, for non-humans, having to disregard the racial [[multishot]] bonus.

Wishing for [[Magicbane]] (even if you're not neutral) may be a good idea because daggers are one of the few weapons Rangers can get expert in. Non-cursed athames (including Magicbane) may also be used to engrave [[Elbereth]] on the ground without dulling the blade. In addition to decent damage, it also dispenses useful magical effects on opponents (cancel, probe, stun, and scare).

Getting an artifact from your god will unrestrict the associated weapon skill. If you cannot wish or sacrifice for artifacts then spears, tridents and crysknives are all within the Rangers' skillset. You can deal significantly more damage by firing arrows in point-blank range, though.

Be careful around water: you don't want your +7 elven arrows to fall in!

====Armor====
Should you require extra AC, a small shield gives +1 AC and doesn't impede your Divination spells too much once you've trained. A shield of reflection can also be useful for its extrinsic, opening up your amulet slot for life-saving (or ESP, but ESP is granted by your quest artifact). Rangers cannot two-weapon, and probably should not be using two-handed weapons at this stage of the game.

A [[robe]] will likely be helpful for spellcasting.
====Spellcasting====
Once you have blessed your arrows and have holy water to spare, you can start blessing spellbooks and learning some of the [[divination]] spells. A good spell to practice with is [[light]] as it's easy to cast and does not take up a lot of [[Energy|power]].
====General====
Because so many things need to be enchanted (e.g., melee weapon(s), arrows, silver arrows, silver dagger/spear etc), scrolls of enchant weapon are at a premium. Consider putting magic markers and wands of polymorph high on your list of priorities. (Enchanting bows is usually a waste; it only helps your to-hit calculations, not damage, and most players hit every round anyway by the time they get around to enchanting things.)
===Late game===
====Objectives====
Raising your experience level past 15 may be useful for spellcasting, but otherwise it's probably not worth the trouble. HP can be raised through alchemy and nurse-dancing.

====Weapons====
You will want a good melee weapon because you will likely be levitating a lot in the endgame. That makes it dangerous to fire projectiles.

Having a silver backup weapon such as a [[Dagger#Silver_dagger|silver dagger]] or silver spear is a good idea. While Rangers can't use silver sabers without penalty (unless they are gifted Werebane by their god, unrestricting it), silver daggers and spears can be thrown at incoming silver vulnerable creatures to soften them up. Silver arrows are precious and should be used only on especially nasty creatures; however, blessed silver arrows enchanted to +2 will last you a long time if you have high Luck.

Remember that range is your best friend. Nasties on the upstair? Get just close enough, your maximum range, and fire away. They will not flee upstairs as you are too far away, they will not summon monsters at that range and they will not attack you.

====Armor====
Most of the spells Rangers will cast are not useful in battle, so a [[shield of reflection]] or [[elven shield]] might be useful additions to your ascension kit.
====Spellcasting====
Rangers can become useful spellcasters, particularly with divination spells. Some of the best spells in the game are [[magic mapping]], [[identify]] and {{Spell of|detect unseen}}. Among the non-divination spells, {{Spell of|jumping}} is useful on the Astral Plane as well as to keep a distance from foes. [[Healing]] may be useful if you have a pet. Unfortunately, Rangers often have poor Pw growth, so you may spend some time waiting before being able to cast again.

Below is a table of all possible spells a Ranger can get at least '''Basic''' at.

{| class="prettytable"
! Skill !! Spells
|-
|Basic||{{Spell of|healing}}, {{Spell of|cure blindness}}, {{Spell of|cure sickness}}, {{Spell of|extra healing}}, [[stone to flesh]], {{Spell of|restore ability}}, {{Spell of|jumping}}, {{Spell of|haste self}}, {{Spell of|invisibility}}, {{Spell of|levitation}}, [[teleport away]]
|-
|Expert||[[detect monsters]], {{Spell of|light}}, [[detect food]], {{Spell of|detect unseen}}, {{Spell of|clairvoyance}}, {{Spell of|identify}}, {{Spell of|detect treasure}}, {{Spell of|magic mapping}}
|}

Rangers use intelligence as their spellcasting stat.

=== Skill slot management ===
Rangers may find themselves short on [[skill]] slots.  A starting ranger will likely want to advance skill with their starting bow.  Shortly after that, the ranger might want to advance skill in dagger and their melee weapon (e.g., spear).  Later, a ranger will likely want to advance skills in spellcasting and either shuriken or dart.  Consider if you'll continue to use a weapon class before advancing to expert in order to save skill slots.

== Quest ==
{{main|Ranger quest}}
The quest sees you fighting [[Scorpius]] for [[The Longbow of Diana]], the artifact bow that creates arrows when invoked and grants [[ESP]] when carried. It also provides [[reflection]] when wielded.

The Ranger quest contains many [[centaur]]s, which are are very fast and use projectiles. In addition to that, all of the quest levels contain traps.
It is advised to have [[magic resistance]] or reflection when going on the quest, since centaurs may generate with [[wand]]s (including, rarely, a [[wand of death]]) as [[offensive item]]s; reflection will stop the worst of the wands from attacking you, and your easiest method to fight back is at a distance using [[poison]]ed arrows, reserving your melee weapon for lesser monsters such as [[scorpion]]s or [[bat]]s.

Scorpius is capable of inducing [[sickness]] with his sting, making it vital to have a cure as part of your kit; a blessed [[unicorn horn]] is typically enough, though there are more statistically reliable means available. Upon reaching the goal level, you can check the maximum range of your bow in order to wake and wound Scorpius at that much distance from the upstair, then finish him quickly with a sprat of enchanted arrows.

"Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters -- but hunters
ever of the servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many
places, not in Mordor only.
If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played
another part.  Many evil things there are that your strong walls
and bright swords do not stay.  You know little of the lands
beyond your bounds.  Peace and freedom, do you say?  The North
would have known them little but for us.  Fear would have
destroyed them.  But when dark things come from the houseless
hills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us.  What
roads would any dare to tread, what safety would there be in
quiet lands, or in the homes of simple men at night, if the
Dunedain were asleep, or were all gone into the grave?"

&&%s&& %s Knight {141443 2021-07-03T08:20:05Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Riding */ {{Wikipedia|Knight}}

The '''Knight''' is one of the player [[role]]s in NetHack. They start as melee fighters with an affinity for [[riding]], and have the potential to become powerful [[spellcasting|spellcasters]] later in the game. Knights are always [[lawful]] [[human (starting race)|humans]].

The [[guidebook]] has relatively little to say about Knights:

{{guidebook|Knights  are  distinguished  from  the  common skirmisher by their devotion to the ideals of chivalry and  by  the  surpassing excellence of their armor.}}

==Starting equipment==
*+1 [[long sword]]
*+1 [[lance]]
*+1 [[ring mail]]
*+0 [[helmet]]
*+0 [[small shield]]
*+0 [[leather gloves]]
*10 to 20 uncursed [[apple]]s
*10 to 20 uncursed [[carrot]]s

The starting pet is always a [[pony]] with a [[saddle]].

==Intrinsics==
At experience level 7, Knights gain intrinsic [[speed]].

==Skills==
{{Knight skill table}}
Knights start with ''Basic'' skill in ''longsword'', ''lance'', and ''riding'', and their special spell is {{spell of|turn undead}}. Knights begin with knowledge of all weapons and non-magical armor.

==Special Rules==
Knights have a special inherent ability to [[jump]], which is restricted to destinations two squares horizontally and one square vertically away, or vice versa, like the [[wikipedia:Knight (chess)|knight piece in chess]]. A knight wearing [[jumping boots]] or casting the {{spell of|jumping}} spell is not bound by these restrictions.

Knights may use the [[turn undead]] [[command]].

Knights do not reduce the [[tameness]] of a steed when mounting it.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Knights now take no penalties for casting [[clerical spells]] while wearing metal body armor, similarly to [[SporkHack]].}}

Knights follow a code of conduct, and take a -1 penalty to [[alignment record]] for the following actions:

* Attacking a sleeping, paralyzed, or fleeing monster in melee, even if the monster continues to attack while fleeing. This penalty doesn't apply if the monster has stolen from you. Monsters getting dressed (e.g., "the soldier puts on a crested helmet") are considered paralyzed for this purpose. Projectiles, wands, and spells don't apply this penalty.{{message|You caitiff!}}
* Eating while satiated.{{message|You feel like a glutton!}}
* Digging down in a shop, if the shopkeeper is alive.{{message|You feel like a common thief.}}

==Quest==
{{main|Knight quest}}
The Knight quest sees you fighting [[Ixoth]] for [[The Magic Mirror of Merlin]].

==Rank titles==
The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1&ndash;2: Gallant
*XL 3&ndash;5: Esquire
*XL 6&ndash;9: Bachelor
*XL 10&ndash;13: Sergeant
*XL 14&ndash;17: Knight
*XL 18&ndash;21: Banneret
*XL 22&ndash;25: Chevalier/Chevaliere
*XL 26&ndash;29: Seignieur/Dame
*XL 30: Paladin

==Strategy==
===Early game===
====Weapons====
Since they start with a +1 long sword and can attain Expert skill with them, [[Excalibur]] is a natural goal for most early-game Knights, and is typically sought out once they hit [[experience level]] 5; more cautious Knights may choose to wait until they train up their [[Attribute#Strength|STR]] and [[Attribute#Constitution|CON]] and/or gain intrinsic speed at XL 7.

The Knight's starting lance is a useful means of ranged attack, but is also very heavy - Knights do not start with high STR and/or CON as consistently as other roles like [[Valkyrie]] and [[Samurai]], and can easily become [[Encumbrance|encumbered]] early on. [[Stash]]ing the lance may be a good idea, especially if you find a [[wand]] or other reliable and lighter ranged option.

Attacking from range with the lance works like most [[polearms]], in that the player character must be able to see the target square; see the article on [[pounding]] for details. In addition, attacking in melee with the lance can joust opponents, stunning them and pushing them one square away (which is the perfect range for another round of pounding). At starting [[skill]] levels, though, you will rarely succeed in jousting - and it risks your hard-to-replace lance breaking - so it is usually preferable to switch to your sword for melee.

====Armor====
The Knight starts with a fuller set of armor than most - most notably including [[leather gloves]] - but it's not very high quality, adding up to only 7 [[AC]] total. Plumbing the [[Gnomish Mines]] for a [[mithril-coat]] and [[dwarvish iron helm]] is risky; without [[infravision]], a dark level blunts your advantages of being able to jump away from threats and pound with your lance from a distance. Upgrade when you can, using a pet to curse-test items in case they're positively enchanted, and find some sort of [[cloak]] to protect your body armor from [[rust monster]]s and [[rust trap]]s.

====Spellcasting====
An early-game Knight will have difficulty casting spells. You don't start the game with any, your low [[intelligence]] makes reading non-blessed [[spellbook]]s dangerous, and your starting helmet and body armor aren't conducive to spellcasting.

Knights looking to start casting early will have to play more carefully than usual. Outside of an early wish for SDSM, the next best option - [[crystal plate mail]] - is both rare and incredibly heavy. [[Studded leather armor]] is the most practical spellcasting-friendly armor, though it has the same base AC as ring mail.

====Objectives====
The Knight's special jump can be a handy escape tool early in the game - it can provide an extra opportunity to engrave [[Elbereth]] or find some stairs, but it does cost [[nutrition]] for each jump. Between this and the starting supply consisting of low-nutrition items (whose uses are explained [[#Your Steed|below]]), the first priority should be stocking up on permafood in general.

Your starting pony is likely your best asset for getting around quickly, and can finish off fleeing monsters for you in order to avoid early [[alignment record]] penalties. It is also a powerful pet in its own right and worth training until it grows up into a horse; remember that riding sets your movement speed to that of your mount, and riding a horse is equivalent to having very fast speed while unencumbered. The starting pony can also be used to liberate items from early shops with no penalty.

=====Your steed=====
:{{Main|Riding|Saddle}}
For Knights planning to make extensive use of their steed, be sure to bless your [[saddle]] as soon as possible with spare potions of holy water, and read its article (as well as the [[riding]] article) for more detailed strategies regarding caring for your saddle.

Failed mounting attempts will deal 10&ndash;14 HP of damage. This is enough to finish off a sufficiently weak and/or beginning character that attempts riding too early. [[Do not pass go. Do not collect 200 zorkmids.|(Sometimes instantly!)]]

Ponies are [[vegetarian]], and thus gain more nutrition from vegetables and fruit such as your starting food unless starving.{{reffunc|dogmove.c|dog_nutrition}}{{reffunc|dogmove.c|dog_eat}} The tradeoff is that finding more food for your steed will be somewhat more difficult; #[[chat]]ting to it regularly (using {{kbd|>}}) is ideal to monitor its status.

If your pony ever comes close to starvation, it will also accept "people food" such as food rations. Be sure to heal a starving horse as soon as possible after feeding it: pets' maximum HP are reduced while starving, leaving them at low remaining HP once fed. If short on food in general, one unorthodox method of dealing with this is to leave the level just before the horse is confused from hunger, let it go feral, and then return after the point where it would normally have starved - taming the now-feral horse resets its hunger level to satiated.

One good early strategy is to feed your pony 9 apples as soon as it drops an item. This will increase its tameness to the point where you will be able to mount it without slipping, and also increases its [[apport]]. If the sum of your mount's tameness and your XL is greater than or equal to 20, you will not slip when you mount unless there is another problem (e.g., rusted body armor).

Another strategy is to avoid mounting your pony until it has gained a significant amount of HP, usually enough to [[grow up]] into a horse; by that point, you will likely have gained a few levels yourself. Steeds are less likely to kill monsters while being ridden, and only counterattack if a monster attack targeting you falls upon them instead. When in combat with your steed, it is best to dismount and let your horse handle weaker monsters such as [[lichen]]s and [[mold]]s (which they will gladly snack on after).

Upon descending past Mine Town or below DL 7, be especially careful of [[polymorph traps]]. If you have [[magic resistance]], it will protect both you and your steed from transformation. In addition, be wary of wearing an unknown [[ring of conflict]], as putting one on will cause your steed to buck you off immediately!

===Mid game===
====Weapons====
A decently-enchanted Excalibur is more than enough to carry most Knights throughout the entire game. Some mid-level knights may decide to joust long-term after training the skill sufficiently&mdash;they should find a [[luckstone]] to maintain positive [[Luck]] if they haven't already. Due to the lance's weight, improving your carrying capacity in some way ahead of time is also recommended.

Knights with Expert skill in lances will want to use their main weapon on weaker monsters to further lower the chances of it breaking; [[invisibility]] is a good way to keep foes off-balance and wandering aimlessly, ideally into pounding range. Soldiers are sometimes generated with lances, making [[barracks]] such as those in [[Fort Ludios]] and the [[Castle]] good places to look for a replacement or spare lance.

====Objectives====
At this point, you may want to begin stashing treasure and other excess items regardless of whether or not you utilize your lance&ndash;being encumbered slows you down and bars you from jumping, and more pertinently makes it difficult to evade foes or run them down before they can deal too much damage. Maximizing your speed is extremely important for combat from this point, especially if mounted&mdash;a [[bag of holding]] can easily do most of the work in that regard. If you make the choice to press on while encumbered, be prepared to shed excess items (e.g. stashing them in a sack that can be dropped at a moment's notice) when dealing with particularly troublesome enemies.

The [[quest nemesis]] [[Ixoth]] is a rather tough opponent&mdash;although he can be dealt with by using [[Elbereth]] or paralysis, his [[Monster spell|spellcasting]] ability is annoying to deal with unless you have magic resistance, and may warrant postponing the [[quest]] until after you clear the Castle. Repeatedly jousting Ixoth on a warhorse with expert skill is also a viable strategy for dealing with him.

====Riding====
Black dragons are likely the worst threat any committed rider can encounter; even if you are immune to [[disintegration]], your mount won't be unless it has [[reflection]] somehow, and the saddle will end up disintegrated if hit by the dragon's breath. Your best tactic is to use your speed to close in while avoiding the dragon's line of fire, then defeat them up close (e.g., with jousting or [[Excalibur]]).

===Late game===
====Weapons====
Knights with Expert skill in lances using a very fast mount can potentially deal severe damage to minotaurs, dragons and high-level demons through jousting and pouding without losing a single hit point.

If you wish to bribe [[Asmodeus]] and/or [[Baalzebub]] in [[Gehennom]], be sure to unwield Excalibur before entering their lairs - if Excalibur is wielded when a demon prince is generated or warps to demand a bribe from you, they will become hostile.

====Riding====
By the time a player approaches Gehennom, maintaining a steed (like any other pet) is likely to be more trouble than it's worth. For those still committed to riding, [[ki-rin]] are perhaps the only steeds that can consistently last throughout Gehennom, and Knights can mount them without decreasing their tameness. However, players will have to decide if they are worth the risks&mdash;a [[wish]] for a blessed [[figurine]] gives an 80% chance of obtaining a tamed ki-rin at best, and despite their good natural AC they are not immune to [[Wand of death|death]] and disintegration rays, which player reflection will not save them from. In addition, their lack of poison resistance will likely spell their doom on the [[Plane of Fire]] unless the player can successfully avoid the [[poison cloud]] plumes.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Ki-rin now have poison resistance, and are no longer considered [[animal]]s. They also now have the ability to cure themselves using their horns, like [[unicorn horn]]s. As they do not leave corpses, they do not drop their horns either.}}

====Spellcasting====
A late-game Knight can amass a formidable array of spells and large [[energy]] pool. However, unlike a [[Priest]] or [[Wizard]], your quest artifact doesn't grant any form of energy recovery, and your natural energy regeneration is as slow as anyone else's, so conserve spells for when they'll be most effective.
