A '''rope golem''' is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is likely to be the first remotely dangerous [[golem]] that players run into, with two claw attacks and a [[grabbing attack]] that chokes you.

==Generation==
Rope golems are always generated with 30 [[hit point]]s.{{refsrc|makemon.c|918}}{{refsrc|makemon.c|1534}} They are one of the two types of golems which do not have a special [[death drop]], with the other being [[straw golem]]s. 

{{upcoming|3.7.0|With {{commit|9e666b75f63eca7e537f55ed8c02ce31ef9434f0|this commit}}, rope golems will now drop [[leash]]es and [[bullwhip]]s upon death.}}

==Strategy==
Though its claw attacks and AC are mediocre, the rope golem's main danger lies in its choking grab. If you cannot pick one off with ranged attacks before it closes in and grabs you, be prepared to engrave a quick [[Elbereth]] or scare the rope golem away through another means (e.g. [[bugle]], [[tooled horn]], etc.); you can still engrave when grabbed this way, and it will release you once made to flee. An [[oilskin cloak]] or [[Can of grease|greased]] armor can also protect against the golem's grab attack.

==History==
Rope golems first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
Some variants give rope golems a special death drop to match other golems.

===Biodiversity patch===
The [[biodiversity patch]] has rope golems drop several [[leash]]es upon death, a trait that has been adapted to many other variants.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], rope golems generate with 60 HP and [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|hit as a +1 weapon]].

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, [[SlashTHEM]] implements the least death drops from the biodiversity patch.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other menial work.
"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the `free sidereal strength of the universe.'
"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy. It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in the Old Synagogue." ...

Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow.  Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face.  An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw.  On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back.

'''Titanotheres''' are large, thick-skinned [[quadruped]]s.

==Origin==

As the encyclopedia says, titanotheres were extinct relatives of the rhinocerous and lived during the Oligocene. They lived in areas that are currently in the United States. They are also known as Brontotheres.

Unlike modern rhinos, titanotheres had a forked horn.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|
Extinct rhinos include a variety of forms, the most
spectacular being _Baluchitherium_ from the Oligocene of
Asia, which is the largest known land mammal.  Its body, 18
feet high at the shoulder and carried on massive limbs,
allowed the 4-foot-long head to browse on the higher branches
of trees.  Though not as enormous, the titanotheres of the
early Tertiary were also large perissodactyls, _Brontotherium_
of the Oligocene being 8 feet high at the shoulder.

A '''baluchitherium''' (plural '''baluchitheria'''), {{monsym|baluchitherium}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is a large [[quadruped]]al [[herbivore]] monster with a pair of strong claw attacks that usually appears late in the dungeon.

==Generation==
In addition to normal generation, they can be summoned by the [[summon nasties]] monster spell.

==Strategy==
Balucitheria can be somewhat threatening due to their strength, and they are as [[fast]] as an unhasted player. However, by the time you normally encounter them,  you should have a source of speed, good damage output and a way to exploit their lack of [[Magic resistance (monster)|monster MR]]. As such, an individual baluchitherium can often be dealt with easily, and tends to only be truly threatening in conjunction with other, more dangerous nasties such as the [[master mind flayer]] and [[minotaur]].

==History==
The baluchitherium first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Baluchitherium}}
''Baluchitherium'', currently known as ''Paraceratherium'', is an extinct genus of long-necked, hornless rhinoceros; the previous scientific name that the monster derives its name from is a [[wikipedia:junior synonym|junior synonym]], i.e. a former scientific name that was not the first one published. Paraceratherium means "near the hornless beast" - this refers to ''Aceratherium'', the genus in which the first species discovered was originally placed.

''Paraceratherium'' lived roughly 34–23 million years ago, and the first fossils were discovered in what is now Pakistan; remains have also been found across Eurasia between China and the Balkans. The animal's taxonomic history is complex, due to known fossils being fragmented and the relative isolation of the scientists that studied it from each other for much of the 20th century. It is one of the largest terrestrial mammals to have existed, with estimates placed at about 4.8 metres (15.7 feet) in height and about 7.4 metres (24.3 feet) in length, and its weight is estimated to have been about 15 to 20 tonnes (33,000 to 44,000 lb); its long neck supported a skull that was about 1.3 metres (4.3 ft) long, and it had large, tusk-like incisors and a nasal incision that may be indicative of a trunk. This makes ''Paraceratherium'' around three times the size of a modern rhino; it also has a similar diet that mainly consisted of leaves, soft plants, and shrubs, and its habitats ranged from arid deserts with a few scattered trees to subtropical forests.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the baluchitherium [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|hits monsters as a +3 weapon]].

'''Pit vipers''' are a dangerous type of [[snake]]. They are also [[swimmer]]s, which means [[trident]]s have a +4 [[to-hit]] bonus while the pit viper is in the water.

There are 5 '''pit vipers''' on the [[Plane of Earth]].

Pit viper corpses are also [[poison]]ous.

Seeing a pit viper falling into a pit will give a [[YAFM]] "How pitiful! Isn't that the pits?".

{{encyclopedia|<poem>
Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without
answering, for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush
there came a low hiss -- a horrid cold sound that made
Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet.  Then inch by inch out of
the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag, the big
black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail.
When he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground,
he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion-tuft
balances in the wind, and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the
wicked snake's eyes that never change their expression,
whatever the snake may be thinking of.
'Who is Nag?' said he.  '_I_ am Nag.  The great God Brahm put
his mark upon all our people, when the first cobra spread his
hood to keep the sun off Brahm as he slept.  Look, and be
afraid!'

The '''python''', {{monsym|python}}, is a [[snake]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. 

== Strategy ==
Pythons are rarely remarkable or dangerous, as they are very [[slow]]-moving and do not do a particularly large amount of damage, although they can use all three of their attacks in one turn, and their [[grabbing attack]] can trap the player; near water, it can also potentially [[drown]] them, making pythons a source of [[YASD]] for players who forget this.

Unlike [[giant eels]] and other sea monsters with drowning attacks, they are not found near water any more frequently than other monsters, so it is easy to forget that they are capable. It doesn't help that the message (“The python grabs you!”) is different than the “swings itself around you” used for all of the other monsters capable of drowning players. On servers and variants that support it, setting a [[MSGTYPE]] rule for this message can help to remind you that drowning is possible. [[Greased]] armor can also protect from the crushing/drowning attack.

}}

The '''barrow wight''', {{monsym|barrow wight}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are members of the [[Wraith (monster class)|wraith]] [[monster class]]; like most other wraiths, they have a [[level drain]]ing [[Drain life (monster attack)|attack]], are resistant to [[cold]], [[sleep]] and [[poison]], and typically [[corpseless|do not leave corpses]].

Barrow wights have a small handful of [[monster spell]]s that can [[Stun (monster spell)|stun]] the player, [[haste self|increase their speed]], [[cure self|heal themselves]], or [[psi bolt|assault the player's mind]].

==Generation==
A barrow wight [[Monster starting inventory|always generates with]] a [[long sword]] and a [[knife]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|472|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Barrow wights typically begin appearing once a character has gained a few experience levels and is on their way [[Minetown]] or the [[Oracle]]. They are among the monsters that can be generated as part of the second quest monster class for the [[Wizard quest]].
Characters that die at the hands of a barrow wight will leave a named [[wraith]] in [[bones]] instead of a [[ghost]].

==Strategy==
Barrow wights move at the same [[speed]] as an unhasted, unburdened hero, and can be more troublesome than expected. They will often throw their knife (and any other projectiles they comes across) upon spotting you; however, a barrow wight's [[melee]] attacks are not particularly strong, but can [[level drain|drain levels]] and still cause significant damage using the long sword. Their spellcasting can also potentially prolong a fight, and may be even more trouble when fighting multiple foes. Alert players, especially ones that can stay out of melee range, can handle them fairly quickly and without too much trouble.

Once a wight is destroyed, the long sword may be of interest to [[lawful]] characters looking to dip for [[Excalibur]]. Barrow wights are also a source of knives for roles capable of utilizing them as projectiles, e.g. [[Healer]]s and [[Rogue]]s.

==History==
The barrow wight first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Wight}}
{{wikipedia|Barrow-wight}}
A "barrow" is a burial mound, such as the ones used in Neolithic times; the word "wight" describes a living human being in its original Old English usage, but has come to be used within fantasy to describe certain immortal ghost-like beings (with "ghost" itself being a less archaic definition of the term). The earliest such example is in [[wikipedia:William Morris|William Morris's]] 1869 translation of the ''[[wikipedia:Grettis saga|Grettis saga]]'', a work of Icelandic family prose; here, ''haugbui'' (referring to undead monsters Glámr and Kárr) is translated as "barrow-wight". 

''NetHack'' most likely derives barrow wights from their 1974 inclusion in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which in turn is derived from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world of Middle-earth. Tolkien's barrow-wights are themselves derived from Nordic folklores such as the ones translated by Morris, and they are typically depicted as wraith-like evil spirits; in ''The Lord of the Rings'', the [[hobbit]] Frodo and his company narrowly escape an encounter with one with the aid of Tom Bombadil, who then arms the group using "barrow-blades" and ancient swords from the wight's treasure-hoard (the basis for their ''NetHack'' starting inventory).

Since then, the wight has become a recurring form of undead in other fantasy works, such as ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' and ''Vampire: The Masquerade''.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]] and other derived variants such as [[SlashTHEM]], barrow wights are a decent monster form for early [[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppleganger]]s due to their resistances and level-draining attack, though their carry cap is somewhat low.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], barrow wights are slightly more common; if a player is killed by a [[Nazgul]], they will rise as a barrow wight in the bones file.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
breast.

The '''monkey''', {{monsym|monkey}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

It is the weakest of the [[apelike creatures]], but may attempt to steal an item from the player and flee.

== Strategy ==
Monkeys are not particularly fast and cannot teleport like [[nymph]]s do, so chasing them down is far from difficult unless you are significantly burdened; however, they cannot steal cursed worn items, and their theft attempts can often fail.

[[Knights]] will want to take care in dealing with monkeys, as attacking a fleeing monster incurs a small alignment penalty; they will want to stay close and perhaps have their pet finish the job.

The difficulty level of the '''sasquatch''' is the highest of the [[Apelike creature|apelike creatures]], the {{white|Y}} monsters. The sasquatch uses not only a regular claw attack but also a strong [[kick]], to deal extra damage. The sasquatch is also faster than all other apes except the [[yeti]], though unlike the [[carnivorous ape]] it will not grab the player.

==Origin==

The sasquatch is a cryptozoological animal not recognized by science. It is said to inhabit the forests in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It is better known as "Bigfoot", hence the bonus with [[kicking]].

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|
The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
creature that we have all come to know.

An '''iguana''' is a small lizard that appears frequently in [[NetHack]], commonly found in the early floors of the [[dungeon]]. While very slightly tougher than most of the foes met to that point, iguanas pose little to no threat against the average player.

The '''baby crocodile''' is simply just a young crocodile.  It is amphibious but rather slow-moving.  It poses little threat to a player, as [[escape]] is easy. In [[UnNetHack]], [[tourist]]s will start the game with a baby crocodile as pet.

While slow, the '''crocodile''' can do significant damage, and is much more difficult a foe than its younger form.

In addition to eating the corpse for a surprisingly large amount of [[nutrition]], there is an alternative use for the corpse: [[polypiling]] it into a pair of non-cursed [[fireproof]] +0 [[low boots]]. This is mostly only worth doing for the novelty value.

&&%s&& %s Wizard's Tower {148159 2022-09-14T21:39:27Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Bottom level */ Syntax The '''Wizard's Tower''' is an upward-extending set of 3 consecutive levels in [[Gehennom]], of which the bottommost is between the 13th and 18th levels, and the topmost between the 11th and 16th levels (and therefore the Tower is constrained to be between DL 36 and DL 47). The Tower proper is reached by a magic [[portal]] in one of the [[Fake Wizard's Tower]]s. The outer maze may contain the stairs to [[Vlad's Tower]].

All three levels are [[non-teleport level|non-teleportable]] and have undiggable floors; only the middle level is eligible to leave [[bones]] files. The top and bottom levels are considered [[graveyard]]s, even though there are no graveyard monsters.

== Maps ==
Each level of the [[Tower]] consists of a central core (the [[Tower]] proper) surrounded by normal maze which contains the stairs allowing passage through Gehennom; it is impossible to reach one area from the other (the outer walls of the [[Tower]] being undiggable and unphasable). It is impossible to [[levelport]] into the tower from outside, but from inside the tower you can levelport either within the tower or to a non-tower level (for instance, to the [[vibrating square]] level after grabbing the [[Book of the Dead]]).

You arrive in (and leave) the Tower at the magic [[portal]] marked in the lower right. The small central tower contains a [[vampire lord]] and a random [[lich]]; the four non-ladder squares have squeaky boards. The [[moat]] surrounding it contains two [[giant eel]]s and two [[kraken]]s. There is a random [[dragon]] near the portal, and the marked [[beehive]] is filled with the usual [[queen bee]] and nine [[killer bee]]s; in addition, randomly placed around the mapped area (or the long corridor of the outer maze immediately to its right) are three random [[demon]]s, a random dragon, and a random lich; two random [[scroll]]s, a random [[weapon]], a random [[potion]], and a random [[tool]]. There is a random [[amulet]] on the upladder. All walls are undiggable and unphasable save those of the small central tower.

The [[Wizard of Yendor]] occupies the centre of the small tower, standing on the [[Book of the Dead]]. The four squares around him have [[squeaky board]]s; a [[hell hound]] and a [[vampire lord]] are next to him, and the moat contains four giant eels, four krakens, and two [[piranha]]s. Randomly placed around the mapped area (or the long corridor of the outer maze immediately to its right) are four random demons, a random dragon, and a random [[giant]]; three random spellbooks, two random scrolls, two random potions, and a [[gem|ruby]]; and a spiked pit, a sleeping gas trap, an anti-magic trap, and a magic trap (in addition to the four marked squeaky boards). The only entrance to the walkway surrounding the moat is via a secret [[door]] randomly located in the west, east, or south walls (walls shown in red). All walls are undiggable and unphasable save those of the small central tower.

==Strategy==
The Wizard's Tower contains many reasons to clear it out (beehive, loot, etc.) but you can avoid most of it if you want. Once in the tower itself via the portal, you can [[level teleport]] up two levels and you will appear randomly within the top level. Beware as you may be overwhelmed by monsters surrounding you!

Alternatively, you can wake up the [[Wizard of Yendor]] from outside with your or a pet [[mind flayer]]'s psychic blast, or with a [[drum of earthquake]], or by getting a pet inside (e.g. using a [[magic whistle]]). Rodney will then bring you the Book.

Finally, you could "teleport" into the tower if you let your pet purple worm swallow you under conflict, end conflict immediately, and then magic whistle both of you around.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.6.0]], any use of the "aggravate" [[monster spell]] would wake the Wizard if you were on his level, even if you were outside the Tower, making it wise not to tarry on his level. This was a bug, and was fixed in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].<ref>[https://sourceforge.net/p/nethack/NetHack/ci/04bc048073e87c55e3bcfa3fceab44fe86361e8a/ NetHack Git repository, commit 04bc04]</ref>

The '''Fake Wizard's Tower''' is a [[special level]] feature in [[Gehennom]]. Two such Towers are located on separate levels, each of which is one to four levels above the [[vibrating square]] level and therefore between the 15th and 22nd levels of Gehennom, or between DL 40 and DL 51.

One of the two Fake Wizard's Towers contains a magic [[portal]] to the real [[Wizard's Tower]]. The level without the portal is eligible to leave [[bones]] files; the level with the portal is not.

This structure at the core of the level is surrounded by normal Gehennom-like maze; the walls are diggable.  Digging is required to enter this tower: Teleporting in will fail and place you randomly in the level, outside of the tower.

One of the [[tower]]s contains a magic portal leading to the bottom level of the real [[Wizard's Tower]] at the point marked 'x'; the other merely contains an [[amulet]] at that position. Both contain four squeaky boards ('^'), a [[vampire lord]], and a random [[lich]]; a single [[kraken]] is found in the [[moat]] of each.

The name ''Fake Wizard's Tower'' is a reference to earlier versions in which the [[Wizard of Yendor]] lived in a similar structure surrounded by maze; these days, he lives in a similar structure surrounded by a much larger tower. Such is upward mobility.

==FIQHack==

The Fake Wizard's Tower has been removed from [[FIQHack]].  They can still spawn as regular rooms, however.  You enter the real Wizard's Tower via it's first floor, not via a Fake Wizard's Tower.

'''Medusa's Island''' is a [[special level]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]'', and is home to [[Medusa]]. The entire level is [[non-teleport level|non-teleport]], and is ineligible to leave [[bones]] files.

==Generation==
The island is 1 to 4 levels above the [[Castle]], placing it between dungeon levels 21 and 28. [[Monster]] creation on this level is biased towards chaotic monsters. 

There are four different versions of the island, each of which has an equal chance of being used.

===Common traits===
Each version of the level contains several [[statue]]s representing Medusa's victims. Except as noted below, there will be:
* Seven statues of random monsters scattered around the level. These statues will contain [[Monster starting inventory|any equipment their monster type might usually be generated with]], but will not have the usual chance of containing a random [[spellbook]].
* Five statues of [[player monster]]s with names and roles from the top-ten list in the same room as Medusa. These statues will be empty.
* A [[historic]] [[statue]] of [[Perseus]], containing (with independent probability):{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|56|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|155|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|273|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|373|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} 
** a 75% chance of a cursed +0 [[shield of reflection]]
** a 25% chance of a +0 pair of [[levitation boots]]
** a 50% chance of a blessed +2 [[scimitar]]
** a 50% chance of a [[sack]]

Medusa is waiting on the down stairs with the statue of Perseus. There are a [[titan]] and a [[gremlin]] in the entrance hall, six [[electric eel]]s and three jellyfish in the water to the left of the level, four [[stone golem]]s and two [[cobra]]s immediately outside Medusa's room, a random {{monsym|Angel}} and a [[yellow light]] in the back room of Medusa's hall, and thirteen more random monsters distributed fairly evenly across the level. In addition to the marked magic trap, there are four other random traps on the level.

In contrast to the other versions, the probabilities of the shield and boots in Perseus' statue are 25% and 75%, respectively. There is also an additional random monster statue, and all eight are placed to the left of Medusa's room as marked.

There are marked [[boulder]]s in the entrance hall and on the right-hand island; the latter has a random [[wand]] beneath it. The walls of both the entrance hall and Medusa's hall are undiggable.

The wand is possibly a reference to [[NetHack 2.3e]] and earlier versions of NetHack. These versions did not have the [[Castle]]; instead, they placed the [[wand of wishing]] in one of the upper [[maze]]s, in a dead-end square with a boulder on top of it.

The up stairs are on the top-center island. The "stairs" marked above are the locations where the actual down stairs can be generated, with Medusa waiting on them; another will have the statue of Perseus, and the third will contain a fountain. Thirty hostile [[raven]]s populate the level, as well as two giant eels, two jellyfish, two wood nymphs, and two water nymphs. Two [[scroll of blank paper|scrolls of blank paper]] are at the bottom of the southermost island as marked, as well as eight random items scattered around the level. Two rust traps, two squeaking boards, and one other trap are randomly placed. The rooms potentially containing Medusa have non-diggable walls, but the right half of the double room (excluding its left wall) is diggable, and trees may be chopped down. This level is "shortsighted", meaning monsters can only see you when you approach within a certain radius.
