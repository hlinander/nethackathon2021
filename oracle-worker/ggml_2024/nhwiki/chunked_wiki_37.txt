==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Muramasa}}
Muramasa Sengo (千子 村正) was a famous Japanese swordsmith who founded the Muramasa school and lived during the Muromachi period (14th to 16th centuries) in Kuwana of Ise Province. They were originally reputed as fine blades favored by the shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu and his vassals, but gradually became a symbol of the anti-Tokugawa movement. 

The idea of Muramasa's swords being bloodthirsty and compelling the wielders to murder or suicide is a product of both the aforementioned political shift and 18th century Japanese lore and popular culture, such as ''kabuki'' dramas - this is also likely the source for the idea that Muramasa passed his own violence and bloodlust on to the blades he forged.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the Tsurugi of Muramasa doesn't provide protection or magic cancellation. Keep in mind that SLASH'EM doesn't have the #tip command, so wielding a cursed two handed weapon is much more serious. As is true of any artifact weapon that simply does extra damage in slashem, it has been considerably improved. The Tsurugi does +8 extra damage instead of +1d8.  Moreover, the bisection effect activates 10% of the time, as opposed to 5%.

However, the ability in SLASH'EM to [[twoweapon|dual-wield]] artifact weapons diminishes the Tsurugi's appeal considerably. Combining [[Excalibur]] and [[Snickersnee]] is an excellent option for Samurai, since both weapons are easily available to them, use the same weapon skill, and both have a flat damage bonus against all monsters.  On average this will do much more damage than the Tsurugi, although it lacks the instakill chance against small monsters. A Samurai who can get his hands on one of the better lawful swords, such as [[Fire Brand]], [[Frost Brand]], [[Grayswandir]], or the SLASH'EM-specific [[Sword of Justice]] can be even more powerful.

The following table summarizes the best-case scenario average damage for the Tsurugi of Muramasa versus two-weaponing the most powerful one-handed lawful swords. The following table does not include applicable strength or ring-based damage bonuses.

*Excalibur: none
*Snickersnee: none
*Sword of Justice: not [[lawful]]ly aligned
*Fire Brand: not [[fire resistant]]
*Frost Brand: not [[cold resistant]]
*Grayswandir: [[silver-hating]] (only [[demon]]s are both silver-hating and suffer blessed damage)

=== FIQHack ===
In [[FIQHack]], the Tsurugi of Muramasa now does double damage rather than +1d8, and can be invoked to uncurse itself.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the Tsurugi of Muramasa now confers [[half physical damage]] when wielded.

'''Vorpal Blade''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[neutral]], and its [[base item]] is a [[long sword]].

One of the randomly generated [[epitaph]]s on a [[grave]] may read "Here lies The Lady's maid, died of a Vorpal Blade".

==Generation==
In addition to randomly generating in the dungeon with a very low chance, the Vorpal Blade appears as a possible sacrifice gift for [[neutral]] players, and is the default neutral [[crowning]] gift for most roles. Neutral [[Wizard]]s and [[Monk]]s can receive it only by carrying their role's crowning gift [[spellbook]] ([[finger of death]] for Wizards; [[Spellbook of restore ability|restore ability]] for Monks) when they are crowned.

==Description==
Vorpal Blade has a +1d5 bonus to hit and +1 bonus damage against small and large monsters; the sword has a 5% chance of instantaneously killing monsters it hits by [[beheading]] them&mdash;this deals damage equal to twice that monster's HP, ignoring any penalties. This also applies to you if you are hit with Vorpal Blade; if you are polymorphed into a monster and decapitated, you will die and be returned to your base form as usual.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1337|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} If Vorpal Blade hits a [[jabberwock]] (including a player in the form of one), it will always behead them.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1296|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} Due to its calculation method, this is not a "true" [[instadeath]]. If you would behead a monster with Vorpal Blade and the target has a head but is [[unsolid]], the sword will slice through its neck without beheading them, which is treated as a normal hit.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1312|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}

How many heads the monster actually has (e.g. [[ettin]]s and their [[ettin zombie|zombie]]/[[ettin mummy|mummy]] forms) has no bearing on the beheading effect: so long as it is corporeal and has a head, Vorpal Blade can behead and kill it.{{refsrc|include/artilist.h|145|version=NetHack 3.6.7|The comment on Vorpal Blade's entry notes that allowing for unusual messages e.g. when decapitating multi-headed monsters would cause more trouble than worth addressing}} However, if the monster has [[Body parts|no head at all]], or else is currently [[engulfing]] you, the sword instead has a 5% chance of dealing no damage in those cases.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1304|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}

==Strategy==
While often overlooked by some players due to its low bonuses to hit chances and damage, others seek out Vorpal Blade for its ability to insta-kill, either to wield for themselves or to keep out of the hands of hostile monsters.

===Instakill probability table===
The following table summarizes the damage done by Vorpal Blade. For example, if you expect to hit a monster ten times, you can assume a 40% chance of beheading it. You have also done an average of 55 points of physical damage to it. The odds of beheading a monster are above 50% if you can expect to hit it 14 times, which entails inflicting about 77 points of damage anyway.

===Monsters wielding Vorpal Blade===
Vorpal Blade is a very dangerous weapon to find in the hands of a monster for the same reason it is sought by players&mdash;[[melee]] combat with any monster wielding Vorpal Blade can easily end in tragedy, especially since you may not be aware until it is too late. In particular, if Vorpal Blade has not already been created in your game, the [[player monster]]s in the [[Astral Plane]] each have a chance of their weapon being turned into an artifact, naturally including long swords possibly being turned into Vorpal Blade.

Definitely avoid close combat in the Astral Planes until you can be certain that your target does not have Vorpal Blade, and attack such targets from a distance when possible; using a [[bullwhip]] to disarm them may be a last measure in especially dire situations. An [[amulet of life saving]] is highly recommended, as even without player carelessness an irreversible [[YASD]] can still occur. While the chances are incredibly low, a player monster with the weapon ''and'' two weapon attacks may be "lucky" enough to behead you twice in a row.

If you kill a monster wielding Vorpal Blade but do not plan on using it at that time (or at all), leaving it in a well-protected [[container]] (i.e. at least with a [[scroll of scare monster]] over it) or stashing it within a [[bag]] in your inventory is highly recommended&mdash;at minimum, it will be kept out of enemies' hands.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Monsters now pick up containers and can loot unlocked containers (excluding cursed bags of holding). Dropped scrolls of scare monster no longer scare any @ or unique monster.}}

==History==
Vorpal Blade is introduced in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

==Origin==
Vorpal Blade originates in the poem "[[Commons:s:en:Jabberwocky|Jabberwocky]]" by [[Commons:s:en:Author:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]], an excerpt of which is included in the [[Vorpal_Blade#Encyclopedia_entry|encyclopedia entry]] below. The unnamed adventurer's "vorpal blade" is used to cut through the eponymous jabberwock and behead it, an action inspiring its potential in ''NetHack'' (and its variants) to behead monsters, and most reliably jabberwocks.

==Messages==
{{message|Vorpal Blade <beheads/decapitates> the <monster>!|The monster has been instantly killed from the special beheading attack.}}
{{message|Vorpal Blade <beheads/decapitates> it!|As above, with an unseen monster.}}
{{message|Somehow, you miss the <monster> wildly.|Your hit would have beheaded the monster, but it lacks a head and thus takes no damage.}}
{{message|Vorpal Blade slices through <monster>'s neck.|Your hit would have beheaded the monster, but it was incorporeal (e.g. a [[ghost]] or [[shade]]) and takes normal damage.}}
{{message|Vorpal Blade decapitates you!|You were beheaded by a monster wielding Vorpal Blade.}}
{{message|Somehow, <foo> misses you wildly.|As above, but you were in a headless form.}}
{{message|Vorpal Blade slices through your neck.|As above, but you were in an incorporeal form.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Vorpal Blade beheads foes 10% of the time instead of 5%, making it considerably more powerful. A similar weapon, [[Thiefbane]], has a 10% chance of beheading any {{white|@}}.

Despite their monster type, [[Vorpal jabberwock (SLASH'EM)|vorpal jabberwocks]] in SLASH'EM are not subject to decapitation on any hit of Vorpal Blade as with normal jabberwocks, instead retaining the same 10% chance as any other monster.

===NetHack brass===
In [[NetHack brass]], Vorpal Blade has a +1d15 to-hit bonus, but deals no extra damage.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], Vorpal Blade deals +1d8 damage instead of the vanilla +1. Additionally, it warns of jabberwocks and instakills [[Vorpal jabberwock (UnNetHack)|vorpal jabberwocks]].

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], Vorpal Blade's damage bonus is +1d8 rather than +1. The average damage for an unenchanted Vorpal Blade is 9 versus small monsters and 11 versus large ones.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Vorpal Blade warns of jabberwocks and additionally protects against beheading attacks.

[[Cerberus]] is immune to decapitation by Vorpal Blade, as he will instantly grow a new head in its place before the other two can be removed.

==Encyclopedia entry==
This entry is shared with the [[jabberwock]].

{{encyclopedia|
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"

He took his vorpal sword in hand;
  Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
  And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
  And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
  He went galumphing back.
|[ Jabberwocky, by Lewis Carroll ]

&&%s&& %s Bane {147709 2022-08-20T09:06:42Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Other 'banes' */* The '''banes''' are a group of [[artifact weapon]]s that each deal [[double damage]] to a specific group of monsters.

==List of banes==
* [[Demonbane]]
* [[Dragonbane]]
* [[Giantslayer]]
* [[Ogresmasher]]
* [[Sting]]
* [[Sunsword]]
* [[Orcrist]]
* [[Trollsbane]]
* [[Werebane]]

==Other 'banes'==
The following uses of "bane" are either unrelated to the above weapons, or else simply a turn of phrase based on them.

* [[Magicbane]] has no double damage bonus.
* [[Sprig of wolfsbane|Wolfsbane]] is a [[comestible]] named after a real-life plant.
* [[Fire and Frost Brand]] have double damage bonuses, but their range of specialty is very large, and so they are not considered banes.

These terms were additionally coined by the community as a reference to or parody of the Banes:

* [[Puddingbane]] is used for any tool, generally a weak and heavily eroded weapon, employed in pudding farming.
* [[Vladsbane]] was formerly used to refer to any object used in killing [[Vlad the Impaler]], formerly an incredibly weak late-game boss.
* [[Dudley's dungeon#Jokes|Newtbane]] appears in [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20050428 the April 28, 2005 issue] of [[Dudley's dungeon]], where it is an ordinary [[long sword]] named by [[Dudley]] in the hopes that it would help him kill newts more easily; he is then felled by a newt named "Dudleyrist".

==Strategy==
The Banes are generally considered to be unnecessary for most purposes or else excessively niche, though this is not always the case; for example, Sunsword is useful as a light source and [[gremlin]]/[[undead]] deterrent, and Dragonbane may see more use than others, due to providing [[reflection]] when wielded and aiding in obtaining [[dragon scale]]s to convert into [[dragon scale mail]].

==Variants==
Because the Banes are often considered underpowered, it is very common for them to be buffed in variants.

{{todo|Include more information about the buffs to Banes where possible, particularly in the SLASH'EM section.}}

===dNetHack===

In [[dNetHack]], all vanilla banes are buffed, and also give you [[Warned of monster type|warning of targeted monster types]] with the exception of Sunsword.

In addition, dNetHack adds more Banes, ranging from moderately useful to highly useless.

* [[dNetHack artifacts#Nodensfork|Nodensfork]]
* [[dNetHack artifacts#Gaia's Fate|Gaia's Fate]]
* [[dNetHack artifacts#Vampire Killer|Vampire Killer]]
* [[dNetHack artifacts#Kingslayer|Kingslayer]]
* [[dNetHack artifacts#Peace Keeper|Peace Keeper]]
* [[dNetHack artifacts#Werebuster|Werebuster]]
* Three new nameable Banes:
** [[dNetHack artifacts#Claideamh|Claideamh]]
** [[dNetHack artifacts#Carnwennan|Carnwennan]]
** [[dNetHack artifacts#Grimtooth|Grimtooth]]

dNetHack also replaces Dragonbane with [[dNetHack artifacts#Dragonlance|Dragonlance]].

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], all the vanilla Banes other than [[Sting]] and [[Orcrist]] no longer deal [[double damage]] to monsters they target, but instead deal +1d20 damage, making them more useful at +0 than they would be in vanilla NetHack.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Giantslayer is replaced by [[Giantkiller]].

Both the replacement and vanilla Banes now have a 15% chance of cancelling the monsters they target; the +1d5 to-hit of most Banes is also increased to a flat +5. 

SLASH'EM also adds new weapons specific to particular monster types, none of which deal double damage:

* [[Deathsword]]
* [[Disrupter]]
* [[Elfrist]]
* [[Holy Spear of Light]]
* [[Thiefbane]], generated on [[One-Eyed Sam]]

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], all vanilla Banes except Sunsword also give you warning of targeted monster types; UnNetHack also adds [[Thiefbane]], which is still generated on [[One-Eyed Sam]] and does not deal double damage.

}}

The '''nurse''', {{monsym|nurse}}, is a [[human]] [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are always hostile and cannot be used as a [[polymorph]] form.

Nurses have a single relatively weak attack, but are unique in that they can actively heal the player under certain circumstances: if a nurse attacks you while you are unarmored and empty-handed (as in not [[wield]]ing anything), and you are not generating [[conflict]], the attack will instead heal you for that same amount. [[Chat]]ting to a nurse will tell you what needs to be removed before they can heal you.{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|1466|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Nurse healing attack code|name=case_ad_heal}} If you are a [[Healer]], a non-cancelled nurse will not damage you even if you are wearing armor or wielding a weapon, and you may occasionally receive a special message.

Eating a nurse's corpse or tinned meat has a {{frac|11|15}} or ~73% chance of conveying [[poison resistance]], and will always restore you to full [[HP]] while curing [[blindness]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Nurses can now heal you even when you are wielding something, as long as it is not a weapon or [[weapon-tool]].}}

==Strategy==
{{main|Nurse dancing}}

If you encounter a nurse, and there are no other dangerous monsters nearby, the easiest way to strip yourself is to press {{kbd|shift|A}} and select all of your armor, plus your wielded weapon, for removal. Once disrobed and disarmed, you can let the nurse start healing. Letting many nurses heal you at once this way is known as [[nurse dancing]], most often done by [[genocide|reverse-genociding]] nurses on a [[non-teleport level]] - see that article for more details.

===Healing attack===
When you are unarmored and not wielding anything, the nurse's attack will restore 2d6 HP per hit and cure [[food poisoning]] and [[illness]];<ref name=case_ad_heal/> being healed this way has a {{frac|3}} chance of exercising [[strength]].{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1405}} A [[cancelled]] nurse will attack and damage you as normal. After healing you, a nurse has a {{frac|33}} chance of [[teleport]]ing away - if you are on a [[non-teleport level]], the nurse will become [[scare]]d for a while instead; if your maximum HP was raised, the nurse also has a {{frac|13}} chance of vanishing entirely.<ref name=case_ad_heal/>

The chance of a nurse raising your max HP is {{frac|7}} for each hit, provided that your maximum is less than 5&nbsp;&times; ''xlvl''&nbsp;+ [2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''xlvl''][[d notation|d10]] - nurses are thus most effective when you have fewer than 7 HP/level, and become completely ineffective at 25 HP/level.{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|1492|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Nurse HP-raising formula}} No such restrictions apply to [[polyself]], but any max HP increases acquired while polymorphed will only last until you revert to your original form.

===Tinning nurses===
Characters with a [[tinning kit]] should ideally tin nurse corpses when possible; the tin and/or the kit itself should be blessed, as it will take two turns at most to open and eat. Tins of nurse meat are often carried alongside blessed potions of {{! of|full healing}} during the late game and the eventual [[ascension run]], as they are comparable major sources of healing.

Nurse meat will always restore you to full HP, while potions of full healing are limited to restoring 400 HP at most; the latter is still sufficient for a majority of cases, and quaffing non-cursed potions while under 400 maximum HP can increase that maximum by up to 8 per potion. Tins of nurse meat in open inventory cannot be destroyed by cold or fire, but opening and eating a blessed tin may take two turns, while a potion can be downed in one go - do not wait until you are one turn from death to consume tinned nurse.

Eating nurse meat is also [[cannibalism]] for humans, with the exception of human [[Caveman|Cavewomen and Cavemen]] - those playing humans in other roles may still want to keep a few tins on hand for dire emergencies, as they may consider it better to live as a cannibal and eventually restore lost Luck than die of hit point loss.

==History==
The nurse has appeared in ''NetHack'' since the very first versions of ''[[Hack]]''. The blindness-curing property of nurse meat was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

A bug prevented nurse meat from conferring poison resistance; this bug was fixed prior to the release of [[NetHack 3.6.2]].<ref>[https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/issues/159 Issue #159: Nurse meat has the flag for conferring poison resistance, but doesn't.]</ref>

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the prison in the northern half of [[Grund's Stronghold]] has a 40% of containing a peaceful nurse.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], nurses generate with worn [[healer uniform]]s and wielded scalpels, and are capable of wielding other weapons. Nurses no longer have a special selective healing attack - it is replaced with a single 1d6 weapon attack, and they can separately heal adjacent targets for 2d6, with an additional d6 for every third level above 9 that they possess. The amount healed is based inversely on the target's defense rating: the higher defense rating you have, the less HP the nurse will restore. As such, nurse dancing is no longer possible.

Nurses are also tameable via {{spell of|charm monster}}, and will only apply their healing to allied monsters: tame nurses will heal players and pets, while hostile nurses will heal other hostile monsters. You can pay a non-hostile nurse to have your health fortified through a number of services, with the price depending on the service and the effect that it replicates. Any [[gold]] used to pay for these services is removed from the game - peaceful nurses add a 10% surcharge, which instead goes into the nurse's inventory. With the exception of the first service, they will only be available if you have an applicable condition that they can cure.

#"Fortify my health" (2000 zm) - This has the same effect as a potion of full healing, restoring up to 400 hp and additionally increasing max HP by 8 if this would fully heal you.
#"Something for my nerves" (1000 zm) - The nurse applies a course of tranquilizers that behaves like a blessed [[potion of sleeping]], with 15 [[sanity]] restored per application.
#"Steroids" (1000 zm) - This has a similar effect to a blessed [[potion of restore ability]] from vanilla ''NetHack'', restoring all lost attributes to their former maximums.
#"Extract morgul shards" (4000 zm) - This removes any and all [[morgul]] shards from your person, and generates 1 metal shuriken per shard with the "lesser morgul" [[Object properties#dNetHack|object property]].
#"Antibiotics" (2000 zm) - This cures any [[sickness]] you currently have.
#"Remove slimy green growths" (2000 zm) - This cures any [[sliming]].
#"Fertility treatment" (1000 zm) - This cures any sterility you have, which prevents you laying eggs in [[oviparous]] [[Polyself|polyforms]] and will always result in detrimental effects when consorting with [[foocubi]].
#"Brain surgery" (6000 zm) - Brain surgery removes one chosen thought granted by an [[insight]]: the process will lower your sanity by 10 points, reduce your [[wisdom]], [[intelligence]] and [[constitution]] by 1, halve your current HP, and creates a glyph on a shard in your inventory. You can [[read]] the shard at any time to re-implant the thought in your head.

A nurse named Nyx inhabits the front hall of the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Windowless Tower|Windowless Tower]]. Several hostile nurses appear in the [[Madman (dNetHack role)|Madman]]'s [[Madman quest|quest branch]], wielding sickness-poisoned [[scalpel]]s.

===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], nurses are included among the various [[racial monster]]s.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], nurses have a {{frac|5}} chance of generating with a scalpel.<ref>[https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack/blob/master/src/makemon.c#L266 xNetHack src/makemon.c, line 266]</ref>

A '''tengu''' is a [[minor demon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Its corpse is valued by many [[player]]s, as it has a chance of granting [[teleport control]] (but can also grant [[teleportitis]]). Encountering tengus can be quite annoying as they extensively teleport themselves during combat after hitting. Unlike other minor demons, they are not susceptible to [[silver damage]].

== Generation ==

The [[wizard quest]] home, locate, and end levels often are pre-populated with several tengu. The [[Knight quest]] levels also generate many random [[i]], including tengu, and they can be easily farmed with the abundance of [[magic trap]]s surrounding the Isle of Glass.

== Strategy ==
Tengu are easier to kill in a no-teleport zone, such as [[Sokoban]]. In addition to reverse genociding them, [[Knight]]s may also consider genociding [[quasits]]; as this makes up most of the monsters generated on the quest levels, this increases the chances of minor demons spawning, including tengu, which allows them to be farmed on the home level.

Contrary to popular belief, the chance of gaining [[teleport control]] from a tengu corpse is not higher if you already have [[teleportitis]].

[[Polymorph]]ing into a tengu grants you [[teleport control]], but this is a last resort because you [[encumbrance|can carry]] only 20.7% as much as your natural form.

=== Chance of gaining teleport control ===

==Mythology==

Tengu are demons or spirits in Japanese folklore. They are portrayed either as humanoid birds or having long noses. They are usually represented by characteristic fierce red masks with very long noses.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|
The tengu was the most troublesome creature of Japanese legend.  Part bird and part man, with red beak for a nose and flashing eyes, the tengu was notorious for stirring up feuds and prolonging enmity between families.  Indeed, the belligerent tengu were supposed to have been man's first instructors in the use of arms.

&&%s&& %s Teleportitis {134172 2020-06-05T01:21:44Z {4001313 Ardub23} Significant cleanup for better layout and prose '''Teleportitis''' is a [[property]] that causes the [[player]] to [[teleport]] occasionally. In the ''NetHack'' source code, the property is simply called "teleport" or "teleportation"; the name "teleportitis" is used to distinguish the property from the act of teleporting.

Teleportation caused by teleportitis works like other sources of teleportation, being blocked by [[no-teleport level]]s and sometimes by the [[Amulet of Yendor]], controlled by [[teleport control]], and landing you somewhere "safe".

Teleportitis is significantly more useful with [[teleport control]]. "Controlled" or "uncontrolled" teleportitis refers to whether a character has teleport control along with their teleportitis.

== Sources ==

Teleportitis may be gained by eating some corpses:

* {{monsymlink|leprechaun}} 50%
* {{monclass|n}}s:
** {{monsymlink|wood nymph}} 30%
** {{monsymlink|water nymph}} 30%
** {{monsymlink|mountain nymph}} 30%
* {{monsymlink|tengu}} 20%
* {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor}} 25%

It may also be gained by wearing or [[eating jewelry|eating]] a [[ring of teleportation]].

== Effects ==
=== Teleporting randomly ===

Every [[Turn|game turn]], there is a {{frac|85}} chance you will try to teleport. This does not cost [[nutrition]] or [[energy]]. Unlike most other forms of teleportation, this happens at the beginning of your turn, rather than at its end. This means you will act immediately after teleporting, before monsters have a chance to move.{{refsrc|allmain.c|220}}

=== Teleporting at will ===

If you have teleportitis ''and'' you have reached [[experience level]] 12 (or level 8 for a [[Wizard]]), then you can use {{kbd|ctrl|T}} to teleport at will. Like the {{+ of|teleport away}} spell, this costs 30 points of [[energy]]. It also consumes 100 [[nutrition]] (unaffected by [[hungerless casting]]), except in some rare cases where your pet prevents you from teleporting (see below). These costs are incurred even if you are on a [[no-teleport level]] or cancel the prompt to choose a location with teleport control.

This can be useful; for example, with controlled teleportitis, you can repeatedly teleport to rapidly decrease your nutrition, so as to eat a set of [[giant]] corpses before they rot away.

If your [[leash]]ed pet is standing too far away from you, cannot be moved next to you, and the leash is cursed, you will be prevented from teleporting at will with no nutrition cost. The same will happen if you are [[riding]] a mount that is carrying the Amulet of Yendor. Both cases will still cost Pw however.

If you cannot teleport at will, then {{kbd|ctrl|T}} will attempt to use your {{+ of|teleport away}} spell instead, or will make use of a [[teleport trap]] if you are standing on one.{{reffunc|teleport.c|dotele}}

== Strategy ==

=== Curing teleportitis===

Teleportitis can be troublesome without teleport control, but it is not as easily removed as other harmful properties. One cure is to have it stolen by a [[gremlin]] at night. However, it will likely steal a lot of other useful intrinsics, and once you have [[teleport control]], teleportitis becomes a boon anyway.

Another cure is to eat [[disenchanter]] corpses. Each time you eat one, you have a {{frac|11}} chance of curing teleportitis. Like with gremlins, though, you will likely lose a lot of other useful intrinsics before you get rid of this one.

Trying to get teleport control is usually better than trying to get rid of teleportitis. Strategies for doing this include [[Reverse genocide|reverse-genociding]] [[tengu]] (on a [[non-teleport level]]) or [[polypiling]] [[ring]]s.

=== Shopping with uncontrolled teleportitis ===

If you need to visit a [[shop]] when you have uncontrolled teleportitis, you should use the following procedure to avoid accidentally [[stealing from shops|stealing]] items:
# Find out how much the shopkeeper is charging for the item you want to buy (e.g. 60 [[zorkmid]]s).
# Drop that much gold on the shop floor by using a [[numeric prefix]]. The shopkeeper will recognize it and establish a line of [[credit]] for you (e.g. "You drop 60 gold pieces. 60 zorkmids are added to your credit.")
# Pick up the item. (If you are randomly teleported out of the shop at this point, your credit will be used to pay for the item without angering the shopkeeper. If your credit is greater than the amount owed, the extra credit is lost.)
# If you are not teleported out, use the [[pay]] command as usual, and the shopkeeper will use up your credit before asking you for any more gold. (Do not pick up the gold afterward and attempt to pay it to the shopkeeper.)

== History ==

In [[NetHack 3.6.1]] and earlier versions, teleporting at will only used 19 Pw, rather than 30. 

==SLASH'EM==

Although [[SLASH'EM]] is based on [[NetHack 3.4.3]], teleportating at will requires 30 Pw. Carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]] blocks teleportation from all sources.

Teleportitis can be acquired by consuming some other corpses (not an exhaustive list):

*{{monsymlink|phase spider}} 40%
*{{monsymlink|brownie}} 80%
*{{monsymlink|Aphrodite}} 100%
*{{monsymlink|leprechaun wizard}} ??%
*{{monsymlink|Giant shoggoth}} 20%
*{{monsymlink|Blinking eye}} 80%
*{{monsymlink|Gypsy}} 100%
*{{monsymlink|doctor Frankenstein}} 100%

Of the four new {{mcsl|n}}, only [[brownie]]s and [[Aphrodite]] give teleportitis.

&&%s&& %s Teleport control {130633 2020-01-12T22:16:05Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Messages */ '''Teleport control''' is a [[property]] that complements [[teleportation]]. You can choose the destination whenever you [[teleport]].

==When it works==

Teleport control works, regardless of whether it is an [[intralevel teleport]] or [[levelport]], and regardless what caused you to teleport ([[teleportitis]], [[wand of teleportation|wand]], [[scroll of teleportation|scroll]], trap, [[quantum mechanic]] attack, or [[throne]] effect).

Teleport control also allows you to attempt to teleport to escape drowning if you have [[teleportitis]] or are a teleporting monster.

==When it doesn't work==

If you are [[Stun|stunned]] or [[unconscious]], you will be unable to control your intra-level teleports. {{refsrc|teleport.c|421}} If you are [[Stun|stunned]] you will be unable to control your [[levelport]]s.  If you are [[Confusion|confused]] your levelports may take you to a random level instead of the one you pick ("Oops..."); this chance is dependent on your luck ([[rnl]](5)).{{refsrc|teleport.c|606}}

If you select a region of the screen you cannot occupy (inside stone), or a square with a trap or boulder or already occupied by a monster, you will instead be sent to a random point in the level with the message "Sorry...".<ref>{{sourcecode|teleport.c|444}}, {{function|teleport.c|teleok}}</ref>

==Acquiring==

Teleport control can be ''acquired'' extrinsically by:

*wearing a [[ring of teleport control]]
*carrying the [[Master Key of Thievery]]

or intrinsically by:

*reaching [[experience level]] 17 as a [[wizard]] or [[monk]]
*[[polymorphing]] into a [[tengu]]
*eating a [[tengu]] (17%) or the [[Wizard of Yendor]] (25%).
*eating a [[ring of teleport control]]

==Controlled level teleport==

If you try to levelport to too deep a level&mdash;if you say "99", for instance&mdash;you will be sent to the lowest possible level from your current position, which generally means the bottom of your current dungeon [[branch]]. A controlled levelport from anywhere in the Dungeons of Doom cannot take you deeper than the Valley of the Dead; a controlled levelport from anywhere in Gehennom can take you only as deep as the [[vibrating square]] level until you perform the [[invocation ritual]].

If you try to levelport to too shallow a level, you will be sent to the parent dungeon branch. For example, the same level 1 is reachable from the [[Dungeons of Doom]], [[Gehennom]], the [[Gnomish Mines]], and [[Vlad's Tower]]. In the [[Quest]], levels are counted relative to the quest branch. In other words, you should use the number displayed on the bottom line (like "Home 1") instead of the depth displayed on restoring ("You return to level 16 in the Quest"). You cannot levelport out of the Quest, and you cannot levelport in [[Fort Ludios]] at all, except to negative-number "levels" (0 is suicide, &minus;1 to &minus;8 are in the sky, and &minus;9 and beyond are heaven).<ref>[[teleport.c#line662]]</ref>

==Messages==
{{message|You feel controlled!|You gained teleport control by reaching XL 17 as a Wizard or Monk.}}
{{message|You feel uncontrolled!|You lost teleport control through [[level drain]].}}
{{message|You feel in control of yourself.|You gained teleport control from eating a corpse.}}
{{message|You feel centered in your personal space.|As above while [[hallucinating]].}}

==SLASH'EM==

In [[SLASH'EM]], it can also be acquired intrinsically by:

*eating the corpse of a [[giant shoggoth]](20%).

extrinsically by:

*carrying [[the Candle of Eternal Flame]]
*carrying [[the Storm Whistle]]

==dNethack==

In [[dNethack]], it can be obtained by eating the corpse of a phase spider. (unknown chance)

&&%s&& %s Scroll of enchant armor {148217 2022-09-24T02:26:59Z {4001589 Qwiption} /* Strategy */ changed error referencing "weapon" instead of "armor" {{scroll|name=enchant armor|cost=80|ink=8-15}}

The '''scroll of enchant armor''' is a [[scroll]] that alters the [[enchantment]] on [[armor]] worn by the reader. The scroll chooses at random which piece of armor will be affected. If any armor is worn on the torso, only the outermost worn layer of [[cloak]], [[body armor]], or [[shirt]] is eligible.<ref>{{function|do_wear.c|some_armor|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}</ref>

==Effects==

All of the possible effects of reading the scroll under different circumstances are documented in the following sections. If the armor's [[enchantment]] is altered as a result of any of the effects listed below, then you have identified the scroll.

===Uncursed===
One worn piece of armor is randomly selected, enchanted by +1, and, if it is [[cursed]], made [[uncursed]]:
* ''"Your <armor> glows silver for a moment."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> vibrates for a moment."'' (blind)

For armor that is already silver-colored, including [[silver dragon scale mail]] and the [[shield of reflection]], the word "silver" is omitted.

In [[NetHack 3.6.0]], due to a bug, cursed armor will not be made uncursed by this scroll. The bug was fixed in [[3.6.1]].


If the armor is a [[dragon scales|set of dragon scales]], it will become a [[dragon scale mail]] of the same color:
* ''"Your set of <color> dragon scales merges and hardens!"''
The level of enchantment will remain unchanged.

===Blessed===
One piece of currently worn armor is randomly selected, enchanted and [[blessed]].

[[Dragon scales]] become dragon [[Dragon scale mail#Making_dragon_scale_mail_from_scales|scale mail]] of the same color, and their enchantment increases by 1.

Other armor has a chance of gaining multiple degrees of enchantment:
{|class="prettytable"
!Current enchantment 
| &minus;3 to &minus;1
|  0 to +2
| +3 to +5
| +6 to +8
| +9 or more
|-
!Additional possible 
|1 to 4
|1 to 3
|1 to 2
|1
|0 or 1
|}

The enchantment gain is determined as follows:

If the current enchantment is +9 or higher, there is a 1 in (current enchantment) chance of gaining one additional point of enchantment, as with an uncursed scroll.{{refsrc|read.c|1054|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

If the current enchantment is below +9, the armor gains 1 point of enchantment, plus a random number from 0 to 3&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;{{sfrac|current enchantment|3}}.{{refsrc|read.c|1055|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=To be precise, when the current enchantment is negative, the integer division by 3 could result in platform-dependent behavior: the integer expression &minus;1 / 3 may be rounded to &minus;1 or 0. The former case makes it possible to gain 4 enchantments from a blessed scroll on that platform.  However, gcc and C99-compliant compilers always treat the result of integer division as an arithmetic quotient (that is, the quotient is truncated or "rounded towards zero"). In that case, only a &minus;3 piece of armor is eligible for a 25% chance of gaining 4 enchantments from a blessed scroll, while a &minus;2 to +2 piece gains 1 to 3 points.}} This means a +3 piece of armor has a 50% chance of being enchanted to +5 by a blessed scroll.

If the enchantment on the armor increased by more than one point, the message printed is modified:
* ''"Your &lt;armor&gt; glows silver for a while."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your &lt;armor&gt; vibrates for a while."'' (blind)

The scroll otherwise behaves exactly as an uncursed scroll.

===Cursed===
One worn item of armor is randomly selected, [[cursed]], and loses one point of enchantment:
* ''"Your <armor> glows black for a moment."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> vibrates for a moment."'' (blind)

==Vaporization==
If the enchantment of the armor is already above +3, the armor may be destroyed when a non-cursed scroll is read:
* ''"Your <armor> violently glows silver for a while, then evaporates."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> violently vibrates for a while, then evaporates."'' (blind)
The probability that the armor will survive is equal to 1 divided by the current enchantment.

The armor may be safely enchanted with a current enchantment of +5 or lower if:
* it is [[Elf (starting race)#Elven items|elven]] or
* it is a [[cornuthaum]] and you are a Wizard.

If the armor is successfully enchanted beyond the safe limit, it may vibrate:
* ''"Your <armor> suddenly vibrates unexpectedly."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> suddenly vibrates again."'' (blind)

There is a chance of vaporizing negatively-enchanted armor with a cursed scroll, with exactly the same probability as using a noncursed scroll to vaporize a positively enchanted piece of armor.
* ''"Your <armor> violently glows black for a while, then evaporates."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> violently vibrates for a while, then evaporates."'' (blind)

===Failure===
In the highly unlikely event that a piece of armor at an enchantment +9 or higher does not evaporate, there is then ''another'' check, with the same probability as the previous one. If this check is failed, the scroll fails to take entirely:
* ''"Your <armor> violently glows silver for a moment."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> violently vibrates for a moment."'' (blind)

==When confused==
Reading a noncursed scroll while [[confusion|confused]] will repair [[erosion]] on one piece of armor, and make the armor [[erodeproof]].{{refsrc|read.c|998|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} As this does not increase the enchantment of the armor, it also does not risk vaporization.

* ''"Your <armor> is covered by a shimmering golden shield!"'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> feels warm for a moment."'' (blind)
For shields, the word "shield" in the unblind message is replaced with "layer".

If the armor was damaged, the following message is also displayed:
* "Your <armor> looks as good as new!"'' (unblind)
* "Your <armor> feels as good as new!"'' (blind)

Cursed scrolls will not repair damaged armor and will remove, instead of applying, erodeproofing:
* ''"Your <armor> is covered by a mottled black glow!"'' (unblind)
* ''"Your <armor> feels warm for a moment."'' (blind)

==When naked==
If the player reads the scroll with no armor worn, their [[strength]] and [[constitution]] are [[Exercise|exercised]], or abused if the scroll is cursed:
* ''"You have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes."'' ([[beginner]] not [[hallucinating]])
* ''"You have a normal feeling for a moment, then it passes."'' (beginner hallucinating)
* ''"Your skin glows then fades."'' (unblind)
* ''"Your skin feels warm for a moment."'' ([[blind]])

==Strategy==
Because the piece to be enchanted is selected at random among all the armor worn, most players normally remove all but the desired armor before reading the scroll.

As with [[scroll of enchant weapon|scrolls of enchant weapon]], you may want to save them until you have enough of them to enchant a piece of armor up to its desired maximum enchantment, in anticipation of any set of armor with a better base AC down the road. You don't want to bother hoarding any more scrolls than that, because you can't dump them all on a single item.

A spare scroll of enchant armor may save you a wish for [[dragon scale mail]] when putting together an [[ascension kit]]. This may make it difficult to get the color of scale mail you want, but if you take sufficient precautions, you can [[Genocide#Reverse genocide|reverse-genocide]] the desired color of dragon.

A [[cursed]] scroll may be useful if you just have to have that +5 armor, but don't want to risk vaporization. However, it's usually better to reduce armor enchantment using the spell of [[drain life (spell)|drain life]], since that doesn't use up a scroll.

The '''wand of secret door detection''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

== Effects ==
{{float right| {{caption|{{Circleradius9|r=8}}|Area in which traps etc. are revealed}} }}
When zapped, the wand has the same effect as a [[spell of detect unseen]]: it detects all undiscovered [[secret door]]s, [[mimic]]s, and [[trap]]s in a radius of 8 squares in line-of-sight upon zapping/engraving.<ref>[[Zap.c#zapnodir]], [[Detect.c#findit]], [[Hack.h#line21]], [[Vision.c#do_clear_area]], [[Detect.c#findone]]</ref> It will also show the location of submerged creatures in pools. On the [[Plane of Air]] only, the wand also penetrates [[cloud]]s.

Nearby monsters that you can't see due to [[invisibility]] will be revealed as {{gray|I}}. Marks on spaces without monsters are removed, and monsters that are [[hiding]] will be revealed. Engraving with the wand will only [[auto-identify]] it if any of these things are present; otherwise, it gives no message.

== Strategy ==
[[Identification]] of this wand is very easy, as it is non-directional and the wands of [[wand of light|light]], [[wand of enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[wand of create monster|create monster]], and [[wand of wishing|wishing]] - all of which are also non-directional - have very obvious effects and usually auto-identify when zapped.

The wand of secret door detection is most often used for finding the hidden entrance to the [[temple]] in [[Moloch's Sanctum]]. It can also be used to find the [[portal]]s on the [[Elemental Planes]].

&&%s&& %s Rogue (game) {147245 2022-08-05T02:50:21Z {4001606 VannevarKush} /* Monsters */ {{wikipedia|Rogue (computer game)}}
{{RogueBasin|Rogue}}
'''''Rogue''''' is the predecessor to ''NetHack'' and all other [[roguelike]] games; it is the reference in the name. Although much simpler than the other roguelikes, it is regarded as a classic, and is just as difficult to beat.

As a tribute to ''Rogue'', ''NetHack'' contains a [[Rogue level]] that is an adaptation of the original ''Rogue''.

== Comparison to NetHack ==

The basic plot is almost exactly like ''NetHack'', right down to the name "[[Amulet of Yendor]]", and the interface is similarly ASCII-based, but several of the innovations of ''NetHack'' are not present in ''Rogue''. For instance, while ''NetHack'' has six attributes, ''Rogue'' has only one: [[strength]]. ([[Dexterity]] is present, but not as an attribute.)

''Rogue'' has fewer monsters (only twenty-six), but several are similar to those of ''NetHack''. For example, the ''Rogue'' aquator is basically a [[rust monster]], and an ice monster paralyzes as a [[floating eye]] does, and causes just as many [[YASD]]s - if not more, since an [[Aggravate monster|aggravated]] ice monster will actively attack [[you]]. (In very early versions of Rogue, the aquator was actually called a "rust monster", and the ice monster was a "floating eye", but the monster names and sometimes their stats were changed around when a commercial version of Rogue was developed for MS-DOS, in order to avoid copyright issues with Dungeons and Dragons content.) Additionally, monsters do not drop corpses or leave behind food rations, making hunger an even more pressing problem than in ''NetHack''.

Compared to other roguelike games that trace their lineage from Rogue, NetHack is much more similar to Rogue. The similarities include:
*Screen size. Both NetHack and Rogue have similar screen sizes that do not scroll.
*Identifying system. Both NetHack and Rogue have similar systems that use scarce [[Scroll of identify|Identify Scrolls]], and in many cases encourage the identification of items through use.
*Similar types of items. Both NetHack and Rogue have [[scrolls]], [[wands]], [[potions]], [[rings]], [[armor]], [[weapons]], ranged weapons and matching ammo. Almost all of the scrolls and potions found in rogue are also found in NetHack in some form or another.
*Similar monsters.
*Both NetHack and Rogue use [[hyphen]]s and [[pipe]]s for walls, while many roguelikes use [[hash mark]]s.

== History ==
Rogue was first released in 1980 (five years before the release of [[Hack 1.0|Hack]]) by developers Michel Toy, Glenn Wichman and Ken Arnold (creator of the curses library).  It was inspired partly by text adventure games like Colossal Cave Adventure, and partly by tabletop role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.  Rogue 3.6 was released in April 1981, and was added to the BSD2 software collection for 4.1BSD, bringing it to a wide audience.  It became very popular in college campuses (at the time, the only places where computers were available).  It was notorious for causing terminals to be occupied and taking up CPU cycles that could be used for productive work.  

Version 5.2 (which is [https://rlgallery.org/about/rogue4.html commonly called v4], released in 1982, was the final version in the "3.x" series of the game.

In 1983, Rogue 5.3 was released, which is [https://rlgallery.org/about/rogue5.html considered the first "v5" release.]  Version 5.4.(4?) is the last version released.  In 5.3, monster names were changed to avoid copyright issues, because of the commercial release of Rogue for MS-DOS on the IBM PC around 1983-1984.  The company Epyx ported Rogue to Atari ST, TRS-80, Macintosh, and Amiga, and Rogue was ultimately ported to a number of other platforms.  Rogue was never very popular on home computers, but did manage to develop a niche following among those who discovered it...

=== Connection to NetHack ===
Rogue was written to run on VAX mainframes running BSD Unix.  The source code to Rogue wasn't originally released, meaning it couldn't be ported to other mainframe and workstation platforms.  This led to the development of various "roguelikes" which attempted to replicate the Rogue experience. These included [[Moria]] (predecessor of [[Angband]]), as well as a number or games that were developed from a leaked version of the Rogue source code (apparently at Bell Labs).  These games included [https://rlgallery.org/about/srogue.html Super-Rogue], [https://rlgallery.org/about/arogue5.html Advanced Rogue/XRogue], and [https://rlgallery.org/about/urogue.html UltraRogue].

One clone was [[Jay Fenlason's Hack|Hack]], written by [[Jay Fenlason]], which became popular after being distributed over Usenet with substantial modifications by [[Andries Brouwer]].  [[Hack 1.0|Brouwer's version]] had only minor differences from Rogue (such as the presence of pets), but was both open source and free. 

The last version of Hack to be released, not counting ports and variants, was Brouwer's [[Hack 1.0.3]].  [[NetHack]] was begun as a continuation of the development of Hack.

==Monsters==

'''Monsters''' in Rogue are represented by capital letters. Each race of monsters is assigned a single letter from the beginning of their name, and therefore there are 26 different monsters. 

* '''Level''' is the level of the monster.
* '''AC''' is the monster's armor class. A monster with lower AC is harder to hit.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>The Venus flytrap, regardless of hit-or-miss messages, does no damage at first, and then deals one point more each time than last turn.

<nowiki>**</nowiki>Poison and Paralysis/Freezing attacks have a 1d20 saving throw.  The value needed to save is 14 - ( [current player level] / 2 ).  [current player level] / 2 rounds down.  This throw also applies to dart traps.  Saving throws for VS_BREATH and VS_DEATH are found in the source, but are not used.  Rogue 3.6.3 also has an unused saving throw for VS_PETRIFICATION.

<nowiki>***</nowiki>Magical saving throw applies, using 1d20.  The value needed to save is 17 - [protection level] - ( [current player level] / 2 ).  Interestingly, a magical saving throw based on the player's stats is used to determine not only if a leprechaun's stealing attack succeeds, but also determines if a leprechaun drops 5x gold when killed.  The player gets a magical saving throw when struck by a bouncing wand bolt, or by dragon breath.  Monsters get a magical saving throw when struck by a wand bolt or magic missile. (but monsters can't have protection)

<nowiki>****</nowiki> Level draining removes 1d10 of the player's max HP.  Being level drained with 0 exp results in death.  If the player is at experience level 1 with >0 exp, exp is reduced to 0.

==Experience Levels==

Gaining an experience level gives 1-10 additional HP.
In addition, you will regain HP faster than before.

The experience levels for version 5.4.4 are:

|}

== Weapons ==
While there is currently only a short bow in Rogue, previous versions have included slings and crossbows.  Shurikens may have been added to replace the ranged weapons that were phased out.

Since bows (and other types of "throwers" from earlier versions) only add their damage and to-hit bonuses to the projectile's base stats, it is usually not worth it to wield a bow and then swap back to a main weapon in a tense situation.
