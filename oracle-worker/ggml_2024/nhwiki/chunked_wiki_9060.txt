The '''ring of stealth''' is a [[ring]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Effects==
Wearing a ring of stealth gives you [[extrinsic]] [[stealth]] and will [[auto-identify]] the ring unless you have another source of stealth.

[[Polymorphing]] and [[eating jewelry|eating the ring]] may grant you stealth as an [[intrinsic]].

==Strategy==
The ring of stealth is a good choice for avoiding sleeping monsters and tackling special rooms (such as the [[Sokoban]] [[treasure zoo]]), especially if you do not have intrinsic stealth, and you either have not found any elven equipment or else your current boots and cloak are useful enough as is (e.g. [[speed boots]] or a [[cloak of magic resistance]]). Its auto-identification is useful for saving players a trip to the [[sink]].

Characters with intrinsic stealth will find the ring redundant, and may opt to polypile them once they have it identified, as well as hanging on to one in case intrinsic stealth is lost.

==Messages==
{{message|You move very quietly.|You put on a ring of stealth, and didn't already have stealth. The ring is auto-identified.}}
{{message|You sure are noisy.|You removed your ring of stealth, and didn't have any other source of stealth. The ring is auto-identified.}}
{{message|The sink seems to blend into the floor for a moment.|You dropped the ring of stealth down a sink.}}

==History==
The auto-identifying quality of the ring was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

&&%s&& %s Ring of sustain ability {149480 2022-12-20T18:20:28Z {4001644 A1} Updated with 3.7 guidance on mind flayer's lack of amensia {{ring
  |name=sustain ability
  |cost=100
}}

The '''ring of sustain ability''' is a ring that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. 

When worn, it prevents the wearer's base [[attribute]]s from being changed in any way, except by [[polymorph]]ing [[Polyself|into your own race]]. This includes stat increase through [[exercise]], as well as stat loss from abuse.

==Strategy==
The ring is quite beneficial in short-term scenarios; for instance, if you lack [[poison resistance]] but have identified the ring early, it is useful to wear while eating poisonous corpses&mdash;this avoids the usual [[strength]] loss, and the ring can safely be removed after you have the resistance. As a more general use, it is employed to prevent stat loss from any sustained abuse, usually resulting from deliberate actions (e.g. constant [[nutrition|satiation]] combined with a [[ring of slow digestion]] to save food).

The ring can also be used to prevent the [[intelligence]] drain from a [[mind flayer]]'s attack, ''but'' it does not directly protect against death by [[brainlessness]]; if your intelligence is already 3 when you put the ring on, then one successful brain-eating attack will still put an end to your game. The ring also does not stop the attack's amnesia effects.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|[[mind flayer]]s can no longer inflect amnesia, thus making the ring an effective mitigation against the [[mind flayers]]'s worst attacks. }}

===Identification===
In addition to identifying it via [[sink]] or [[wand of enlightenment]], a player can identify a suspected ring by wearing it and doing something that would alter their attributes, e.g. eating a tin of [[spinach]], quaffing a non-cursed [[potion of gain ability]], sitting on a coaligned [[altar]], or applying a cursed [[unicorn horn]].

==History==
Before [[NetHack 3.6.1]], a bug allowed you to use a ring of sustain ability to increase strength. When wearing the ring, if your nutrition status changes to Weak, your strength wouldn't go down as it usually does. However, if you then removed the ring and then raised your nutrition status to Hungry, your strength would increase as usual.

This could be [[farming|farmed]] or abused to raise your [[strength]] to its racial maximum, provided that you have a large number of low-nutrition comestibles (such as [[meatball]]s). You first get your [[nutrition]] status to Hungry, and then:
# Put on the ring of sustain ability;
# Wait until your hunger status changes to Weak;
# Remove the ring of sustain ability;
# Eat a meatball (or enough meatballs to go from Weak to Hungry);
# Repeat steps 1 through 4 until your strength reaches its racial maximum.

A ring of {{of|ring|hunger|conflict|or=1|regeneration}} will speed up this process. Beware of possible negative effects, especially if the ring is cursed.

This would be especially productive for characters who start with low strength and the {{spell of|stone to flesh}} spell, such as [[Healer]]s.

  |name=warning
  |cost=100
}}

Wearing a '''ring of warning''' gives you the [[warning]] property.

== Identification ==

It is easy to identify; simply wear it and go to a dungeon level with monsters that you cannot directly see. The warning will cause them to be displayed as numbers (or colored question marks, if playing with tiles).

== Strategy ==

{{main|Warning}}

Warning is a valuable property to have; while it does not explicitly reveal the identity of the creatures a la [[telepathy]], it has a larger range than telepathy, and works while unblind unlike intrinsic telepathy. Telepathy also does not sense mindless creatures like undead, whereas warning works on all but monsters of level 3 or lower. However, several roles get warning intrinsically as they increase in level; for them, a ring of warning is obviously useless once they reach that point.

Wooden or metal rings of warning can be [[Eating jewelry|eaten]] to acquire warning intrinsically.

  |name=poison resistance
  |cost=150
}}

Wearing a '''ring of poison resistance''' gives you [[poison resistance]] as an [[extrinsic]].

==Identification==

If you notice yourself surviving poison attacks unscathed, you know you must have a source of poison resistance. However, deliberately poisoning yourself is not a good way to identify this ring.

===Sink identification===
Dropping a ring of poison resistance into a [[sink]] produces the message, ''"You smell rotten fruit"''.

==Strategy==
This is an excellent ring to discover early in the game, if you can identify it. You should wear uncursed rings of 150zm base cost in the hope that a randomly found one might be poison resistance.

If you know you have poison resistance through wearing this ring, you can then eat poisonous corpses until you gain the resistance as an [[intrinsic]], with an appropriately changed message; you can then dump the ring in favour of other, more useful ones. If you play at night, however, try to hang on to the ring in case a [[gremlin]] steals the intrinsic away.

Wearing a '''ring of fire resistance''' gives you [[fire resistance]].

Interestingly, it is more expensive than any other ring that provides an elemental resistance, with a base price of 200. See [[price ID]].

Dropping a ring of fire resistance down a [[sink]] produces the message '''''"The hot water faucet flashes brightly for a moment."'''''

Wearing a '''ring of shock resistance''' gives you [[shock resistance]]. Unlike other rings, it is immune to electric damage, e. g. when a monster zaps you with a [[wand of lightning]] or a trapped [[chest]] explodes<ref>[[zap.c#3886]]</ref>.

== Strategy ==

Using one in the early/mid-game is common, especially when facing enemies with wands of lightning, but as soon as a source of [[reflection]] is found it's better to remove it, keeping it ready for an emergency such as being engulfed by an [[energy vortex]].

&&%s&& %s Ring of teleportation {146359 2022-06-28T23:08:18Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Identification */ {{ring
  |name=teleportation
  |cost=200
}}

Wearing a '''ring of teleportation''' gives you [[teleportitis]]. These rings are often generated cursed.

==Identification==

A cursed ring with a base price of 200 is very probably teleportation. To be sure, you can uncurse it and put it on - if {{kbd|ctrl|t}} gives "You cannot teleport at will" instead of "You don't know that spell", it is teleportation.

==Strategy==
{{main|Teleportitis#Strategy}}

The usefulness of teleportitis is rather schizophrenic; uncontrolled, it is usually considered a great annoyance, as you will often be teleported into danger (or worse, out of [[shop|shops]]). Once the player gains [[teleport control]], it is a great boon, and when combined with [[magic mapping]], allows you to clear levels of [[Gehennom]] in seconds.

The usefulness of this ring depends on whether or not you have [[teleport control]], and how.  If you don't have it, it is mostly useless below XL 12 (8 for wizards).  After that point, it can be useful as a swappable [[escape item]], but a [[wand of teleportation|wand]] or [[scroll of teleportation]] is probably preferable.  If you have teleport control from a ring, whether or not to use this ring is a choice: if you choose to eat a corpse which conveys teleportitis, it spares you the ring slot if you want controlled teleports.  However, you must always keep your ring of teleport control on, and if you lose it somehow, you are stuck with uncontrolled teleportitis.  If you have teleport control intrinsically or from the [[Master Key of Thievery]], you should pretty much always eat a corpse that conveys teleportitis instead of wearing a ring of teleportation.  If you're using the Key, bag it when the [[Wizard of Yendor|Wizard]] appears.

Even without any teleport control source, the ring is a controllable source of teleportitis, and thus can be used for niche situations like escaping from [[vault]]s.

==UnNetHack==
In [[UnNetHack]], dropping this ring down a sink will teleport the sink to a random location.

  |name=polymorph
  |cost=300
}}

Wearing a '''ring of polymorph''' gives you [[polymorphitis]], which has a 1% chance of [[polymorph]]ing you each turn.
This ring is usually generated cursed, because uncontrolled polymorphitis is really a pain. It can also cause [[system shock]]  (unless you have control or are wearing dragon scales or dragon scale mail).

If you have [[polymorph control]], you may choose the form into which you polymorph. If you are inflicted with [[lycanthropy]], the ring of polymorph will occasionally trigger a change into your normal form or the animal form of the werecreature that infected you.

If you are wearing an [[amulet of unchanging]], the ring of polymorph will have no effect (besides the usual [[ring hunger]]).

Dropping the ring into a [[sink]] will polymorph the sink into one of [[altar]], [[fountain]], [[grave]] or [[throne]].  This is a [[3.6.0]] addition integrated from [[UnNetHack]].

== Identification ==

If you find a [[ring]] and test its [[Price identification|price]] and [[BUC]] status, the chance of a ring of polymorph is given in the following table. You can rule out [[ring of teleport control|teleport control]] by walking on a [[Trap#.5E_Teleportation_trap|teleportation trap]] and [[ring of conflict|conflict]] by wearing it in sight of monsters.

  |name=invisibility
  |cost=150
}}

Wearing a '''ring of invisibility''' makes you [[invisible]].

== Generation ==

[[Nazgul]] will always leave a cursed ring of invisibility.

== Strategy ==

This can be useful in the early game, as most monsters don't have [[see invisible]], but eventually loses its usefulness as more monsters have this intrinsic. Zapping yourself with a wand of make invisible is a useful way to permanently make yourself invisible without taking a ring slot.

It can occasionally be useful if you want to [[Shopkeeper#Ways_to_kill_shopkeepers_easily|kill shopkeepers]] [[Stealing from shops|to steal]]: take it off to enter, put it on to line up for ranged attacks, and repeat with the next shop.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"When time came for the shepherds to hold their customary
assembly in order to prepare their monthly report to the king
about the state of the flocks, he came too, wearing this ring.
While he was sitting with the others, it chanced that he moved
the collet of the ring around toward himself into the inside of
his hand; having done this, he disappeared from the sight of
those who were sitting beside him, and they discussed of him as
of someone who had left.  And he wondered and once again feeling
for the ring, he turned the collet outwards and, by turning it,
reappeared.  Reflecting upon this, he put the ring to the test
to see if it indeed had such power, and he came to this
conclusion that, by turning the collet inwards, he became
invisible, outwards, visible.  Having perceived this, he at
once managed for himself to become one of the envoys to the
king; upon arrival, having seduced his wife, with her help,
he laid a hand on the king, murdered him and took hold of the
leadership."

Wearing a '''ring of see invisible''' gives you [[see invisible]], which lets you see creatures that are [[invisibility|invisible]].

== Identification ==

Dropping this ring down a [[sink]] while not blind produces the message <b>You see some air in the sink. </b>

Putting on this ring while not having the intrinsic, but being invisible (via ring, potion or other means) produces the message <b>Suddenly you are transparent, but there!</b> This also auto identifies the ring.

== Strategy ==

As invisible monsters are tricky to detect without [[telepathy|other]] [[warning|properties]], this ring can be useful to tide you over until you can gain the property intrinsically. Wearing it constantly may not be necessary; just slip it on at first notice of a spellcaster turning invisible or assault by an unseen monster.

Most of the level is filled with solid rock, with some caverns scattered around as shown above. You will start the level in the bottom-right cavern. The [[portal]] to the [[Plane of Air]] is randomly placed in one of the other caverns. As of 3.6.0 there are additional single square caverns scattered around randomly in which the [[portal]] may also be.

When you enter the level the [[Wizard of Yendor]] will make his only mandatory reappearance (helpfully carrying a [[spellbook of dig]]). There is also an [[Elvenking]] carrying a [[pick-axe]] and a [[minotaur]] with a [[wand of digging]] nearby. The remainder of the level contains 27 [[earth elemental]]s, eight [[rock troll]]s, five [[stone giant]]s, five [[pit viper]]s, three [[barbed devil]]s, three [[pit fiend]]s, a [[rock piercer]], an [[umber hulk]], a [[dust vortex]], four [[stone golem]]s, a [[scorpion]], and a [[minotaur]], distributed fairly evenly among the caverns.

==Strategy==
The Plane of Earth is the most straightforward of the planes. Once the Wizard has been dispatched, the only real challenge is locating the portal.

===Moving===

Digging with a pick-axe or [[mattock]] should be avoided on this level if possible, not only because it is much slower than wands or spells of digging, but also because it will sometimes generate earth elementals and xorns ("The debris from your digging comes to life!").{{refsrc|dig.c|399}} If you must resort to this, you should always use a [[blessed]] pick&mdash;there is a 1 in 3 chance that a small area of rock around your character will immediately clear. ("A mysterious force [creates a/extends the] cave around you!") Otherwise, there is a 1 in 6 chance (1 in 4 if the pick is cursed) that "Crash! The ceiling collapses around you!", causing a similar small area around you to cave in, slowing progress.

The single wand of digging dropped by the minotaur may not be sufficient to reach the portal, especially if exploration is required. Bringing a few wands of your own or a source of [[charging]] is strongly recommended, and there should be several available by the time you are ready to enter the Planes.

===Surviving===
Most of the monsters should pose no real threat to an ascension-worthy character. However, the many earth elementals are much tougher than those generated in the dungeons.{{refsrc|makemon.c|939}} As usual, they will [[phase]] through the solid rock to get to you; if you dig too slowly they may surround you, further impeding your progress. [[Conflict]] can help if you are surrounded, as does [[polymorphing]] into a phasing monster yourself, which will enable you to move around rapidly; the usual polyselfing caveats to those forms apply.

===Portal detection===
The portal can be located by the [[Portal detection methods|usual methods]]&mdash;[[scroll of gold detection]], [[wand of secret door detection]], spell of {{Spell of|detect unseen}}, wearing the Amulet, and so on. Reading a [[cursed]] [[scroll of gold detection]] is the fastest and easiest&mdash;just remember where it was, because it will become invisible when you get near. Non-cursed scrolls also work but require becoming [[confusion#Confused scroll effects|confused]]. Players who lack a [[confusion#Causes|confusion source]] for their scrolls of gold detection might want to seek out the umber hulk in the center of the level, as with some careful manipulation it is possible to enter the [[Plane of Air]] confused as well. If one lacks such resources it is possible, though much slower, to locate the portal by physically visiting each cavern and searching or walking over every square. Having the [[automatic searching]] intrinsic or extrinsic will be useful for this.

The '''Plane of Air''' is the second of the [[Elemental Planes]]. It is reached by a magic [[portal]] from the [[Plane of Earth]]. Only monsters that can [[fly]] (excluding [[lurkers above]]), can float, are amorphous, are noncorporeal, or are whirly will be randomly generated.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|70|nethack=3.6.6}}

The Plane of Air is ineligible to leave [[bones]] files. The entire level is no-teleport.

==Map==
[[Image:Plane_of_Air.png|thumb|right|280px|An example layout of the Plane of Air.]]

The level consists of open air, with multiple opaque moving [[cloud]]s scattered throughout. You enter the level somewhere in the left side of the level, and the portal to the [[Plane of Fire]] is somewhere in the right side.

The level contains eleven [[air elemental]]s, three [[floating eye]]s, three [[yellow light]]s, a [[couatl]], three [[djinn]], nine [[fog cloud]]s, five [[energy vortices]], five [[steam vortices]], two [[jabberwock]]s, five random [[dragon]]s, and three random {{white|E}}, all placed randomly.

==Strategy==
As always, the priority is locating and entering the portal to the next Plane. The two primary challenges to this end are controlling your movement across the level and surviving the monsters and lightning strikes.

===Moving===
Movement on the Plane of Air without either [[levitation]] or flight is hard - there is a {{frac|3|4}} chance of failing to move, with equal chances of exercising dexterity, abusing it, or neither. Every turn, there is a {{frac|8}} chance of lightning strikes. If you are inside the clouds when lightning strikes, you will be paralyzed for three turns and [[deaf]]ened for {{rn1|20|30}} (more) turns; the paralysis ignores [[free action]].{{refsrc|src/timeout.c|1613|nethack=3.6.6}} The lightning strikes themselves can occur outside the clouds, but are [[reflection|reflectable]].

Even if you are not levitating at will, some of the effects of levitation apply. If you throw objects or kick monsters, you will be propelled in the opposite direction, in accordance with Newton's third law. If you want to escape a situation quickly, you can propel yourself by throwing junk objects - although you will then be left helpless for a number of turns equal to the distance you moved.

If you don't have any sources levitation or flight, trying to move by struggling through the air will take far longer than any other method, making it much more likely that you will end up in the cloud banks at the wrong time. As indicated above, one way to travel without control of your movements is to throw objects in the opposite direction. This is reasonably expeditious, and may warrant carrying some light junk objects to the Planes if no other options are available.

Another option is to get engulfed by a whirly monster (e.g., a steam vortex if you have [[fire resistance]]) and let it ferry you around - however, '''do not''' get carried into the clouds! The clouds move across the level, and whirly monsters can move near or into them while you are inside them&mdash;the tougher air elementals in combination with an ill-fated lightning strike can make short work of even a well-prepared character. If you find yourself engulfed by a whirly monster intent on dragging you deep into the clouds, do your best to break out as soon as possible.

===Survival and combat===
The monsters on this plane are fairly tough. The air elementals move much faster than even a [[very fast]] player and can dish out damage quickly; while a [[wand of slow monster]] or [[wand of opening]] will force them to expel you, the air elemental may likely re-engulf you before you can escape. They are also generated to be much tougher than the ones encountered in the dungeons; keep an eye on your HP and be prepared to expend some resources to escape and/or kill them when necessary. As mentioned above, they may also pull you close to or into the clouds, making escape paramount.

Air elementals are susceptible to various spells and wands, such as the [[wand of sleep|sleep]] [[spell of sleep|spell]], [[wand of death|death]] [[Finger of death|rays]], [[wand of teleportation|teleportation]] [[spell of teleportation|beams]], and so on. [[Polymorphing]] is also a valid strategy, but carries the usual risks of producing something worse.

As this plane has no normal floor, you cannot use [[Elbereth]] in emergency situations; the [[scroll of scare monster]] still works normally. [[Tooled horn]]s and [[leather drum]]s are also solid monster deterrents. You can also hide in the steam vortexes as mentioned previously - with fire resistance, they will do no damage and allow you to safely restore HP while engulfed, though the primary hazard then becomes the clouds and their aforementioned lightning strikes. [[Conflict]] is also viable to keep monsters occupied and away from you while you prioritize finding the portal. 

===Portal detection===
As with the other elemental planes, you must locate the portal. It is stationary, but not immediately visible, so the [[Portal detection methods|usual methods]] work nicely. As the area the portal can be placed in is relatively small, it is easier than usual to find it with [[The Amulet of Yendor|the Amulet]]. The moving clouds, however, limit the reliability of a [[wand of secret door detection]].

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, as well as variants based on them, the clouds do not move, and the layout is static:

<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]
.=[[air|{{gray|&nbsp;}}]]
#=[[cloud|{{gray|#}}]]

........................####................................................

.............................#..################............................
..............................#..######...#####.............................
............................#......##......####.............................
...........................................###..............................
</replacecharsblock></div>

The best path for most players is to either break through the cloud bank at the narrow point near the middle of the map, or go around it altogether at the top.

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], the escape portal can be located on either side of the Plane, even a few steps from your arrival point.

Some monsters spit '''venom''' at you, which acts as a projectile attack. This takes the form of either: 
* '''blinding venom''', which [[blind]]s you as a [[cream pie]] when you are hit by it, or
* '''acid venom''', which deals 2d6 [[acid]] damage.

[[Juiblex]] and [[black naga]]s spit acid venom; [[guardian naga]]s and [[cobra]]s spit blinding venom.

== Generation ==
Internally, objects for venom exist (to act as the projectiles), but they almost always disappear upon hitting anything. However, you can create them by [[polymorphing]] into the respective mosters and spitting venom into [[moat|water]] with the [[Monster (command)|#monster]] command, e.g., on [[Medusa's Island]] or any pool if you manage to hit it exactly. The permanent venom objects can then be picked up the usual way by diving or by [[levitating]] with a [[bullwhip]]. And of course, a [[wizard mode]] wish can create them.

== Effects ==
They are listed under the inventory heading "Venoms", and both appear as "a splash of venom" when unidentified. When thrown, they will have the expected effects. A stack of them can also be quivered. Attempting to [[engrave]] with this item prompts a [[YAFM]]: "Writing a poison pen letter?"

They can be [[greased]] (even though science is unsure how that works), but that is not necessary as they are surprisingly robust and waterproof. Getting venom objects out of a [[container]] is tricky, because the menu code doesn't expect them to exist. You must either switch the ''menustyle'' [[option]] to ''traditional'' or use the #[[tip]] command.

== Strategy ==
A fun use is to blind the [[Riders]] with them: it's easier than polymorphing into a guardian naga on the [[Astral Plane]], and they weigh less than a stack of cream pies. 

== History ==
[[NetHack 3.4.3]] would crash when listing the contents of a container with venom objects in it while generating the [[dumplog]] at the end of a game. In particular this meant you had to take all venom out of your [[bag of holding]] into your main inventory before [[ascend]]ing; otherwise, NetHack would segfault immediately before the ascension was counted as complete in the server stats.<ref>[https://s3.amazonaws.com/altorg/dumplog/Luna1/1395185008.nh343.txt incomplete dumplog] due to NAO server segfaulting</ref> This bug has been fixed since 3.6.0.

''[[NetHack]]'' is a [[roguelike]] game, but there is one [[special level]] that is more like ''[[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]'' than the others. This '''Rogue level''' is a reincarnation of the original ''Rogue''. The welcoming message you receive is: ''You enter what seems to be an older, more primitive world''.

This [[special level]] is guaranteed somewhere in each [[dungeon]], between levels 15 and 18 inclusive of the main dungeon. Here is a list of traits from the older ''Hack'' and ''Rogue'' games that you can also find in the Rogue level of ''NetHack''.
* The level consists of a 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3 grid, each cell of which may contain a room or a corridor node.
* All monsters are represented as uppercase letters.
**''NetHack'' achieves this by not spawning any lowercase-letter monsters at this special level. It is still possible to bring lowercase-letter monsters like [[pet]]s from other levels to this level.
* [[Door]]s, represented by {{white|+}} (plus sign), act like open [[doorway]]s, meaning that you can not walk diagonally through them. There is no way to close or destroy these doors.  [[Wizard lock|Magical locking]] will turn them into [[secret door]]s instead.{{refsrc|lock.c|953|nethack=3.6.1}}
* There are no [[DECgraphics]] or [[color]]. ''Rogue'' and ''Hack'' lacked these features. ''NetHack'', at least when playing the [[tty]] port, disables these [[option]]s during the special level.
** [[IBMgraphics]] has an interesting effect. Especially for [[DOS]] users, ''NetHack'' replaces several characters with the ones used in a DOS port of ''Rogue''. See [[IBMgraphics#Rogue level|IBMgraphics §&nbsp;Rogue level]] for more information.
* Stairs are represented as {{white|%}} (percent sign).
** ''Hack'' uses {{white|<}} (left angle bracket) and {{white|>}} (right angle bracket), like ''NetHack'' normally does.
** In ''Rogue'', there was always one stairway: down if you had not found the [[Amulet of Yendor]], or up if you had found it. ''Hack'' and ''NetHack'' introduced an innovation where old levels were saved to disk, allowing you to freely travel up and down. Thus, the roguelike level of ''NetHack'' contains two percent signs.
* [[Food]] is represented as {{white|:}} (colon).
** ''Hack'' uses {{white|%}} (percent sign).
** Since ''NetHack'' uses {{white|:}} (colon) for food and corpses at this level, some players might mistake these things as [[newt]]s or other [[lizard]]-like [[monster]]s.
** Monsters do not leave corpses{{refsrc|mon.c|2016|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} nor [[death drop]]s.{{refsrc|mon.c|2295|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} ''Rogue'' did not implement corpses. [[Troll]] corpses brought to the level can still rise, however.
* [[Armor]] is represented as {{white|]}} (right square bracket).
** Many players don't even notice the difference because ''NetHack'' uses the similar-looking {{white|[}} (left square bracket).
* [[Zorkmid]]s and gold pieces are represented as {{white|*}} (asterisk) instead of {{white|$}} (dollar sign).
* Hostile monsters are unable to tunnel through rock.{{refsrc|monmove.c|800|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} (This is perhaps related to [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-4|bug C343-4]].)
*When selecting dungeon features at the [[farlook]] or [[travel]] command prompt, the keys work as usual. For example, stairs are {{kbd|<}} and {{kbd|>}} despite display as {{white|%}} etc.
* [[Astral vision]]'s illumination as granted by [[The Eyes of the Overworld]] does not seem to work here, possibly due to a bug, or possibly intentionally to remain true to ''Rogue''.

There will also be a named [[ghost]] on this level, guarding a fake bones pile, possibly including a [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]]. By default the ghost will be named after one of the creators of ''Rogue'', either Michael Toy, Kenneth Arnold, or Glenn Wichman, but the ghost's name can be changed using the [[environment variable]] <tt>ROGUEOPTS</tt>. For example, if the variable is set to <tt>name=X</tt>, then the ghost's name will be ''X''. The loot being guarded by the ghost includes:
* d7 food rations (75% chance)
* either a [[mace]] (enchantment +1 to +3) or a [[two-handed sword]] (enchantment &minus;1 to +3)
* a +1 bow
* 25 to 34 +0 arrows
* either a [[ring mail]] (enchantment +0 to +2) or a [[plate mail]] (enchantment &minus;1 to +3); {{frac|3}} chance of being rustproof
* an identified [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]] (50% chance)

Each of these items except the food and the amulet has a 75% chance of being cursed. In ''Rogue'', the player's starting weapon was a mace, which accounts for its presence here.

The Rogue level is eligible to leave [[bones]] files, and may contain the [[quest portal]].

It is to be run after NetHack has left a bones file, and it will connect to a central server. If Hearse finds that the local copy of NetHack contains new bones files it will upload them to the server and download random bones files of the same [[dungeon level]]. Hearse currently supports Nethack 3.3.1, 3.4.0 to 3.4.3, and 3.6.0 to 3.6.6.

The Windows version of Hearse and other versions are not the same. The configuration file for the Windows version allows for up to five extra bones files to be downloaded if you are running short of bones.  This way you will never have to play a bones-less game.

The old Hearse server was disconnected in 2019 after having served for 17 years; as of 2021, a new server has been set up.

==Messages==
{{message|You start playing the flute.  You produce soft music.|You improvised on a magic flute.}}

==Strategy==
The magic flute has its biggest advantage over the wand of sleep or sleep spell in that those methods are targeted in a single direction, while the magic flute is omnidirectional. This comes in handy in open-spaced levels where the player may be attacked from all sides, or as a defense against monsters who immediately summon other monsters completely surrounding the player. Similar to doorway combat, a player with [[stealth]] can use the sleeping monsters as protection, and funnel the remaining monsters through to fight them one-by-one.

A player with the [[Tourist]] quest artifact, [[The Platinum Yendorian Express Card]], can make frequent use of the magic flute as it can be recharged infinitely.

&&%s&& %s Flute {149832 2023-02-01T01:59:10Z {4001651 Nethacker1} added identification section, which should be in this article A '''flute''' might be one of two [[musical instrument]]s:

* [[Wooden flute]], base price 12 zorkmids
* [[Magic flute]], base price 36 zorkmids

If it produces anything but soft music when improvising, it's not a magic flute.

==Identification==

The two flutes are fairly easy to distinguish from each other via price identification or via use testing. When playing (if one chooses to "improvise"), a wooden flute will either "trill" (which pacifies snakes) or "toot".  A magic flute with charges will play "soft music"; an uncharged magic flute behaves the same as a wooden flute, but is only likely to occur in bones.

'''Musical instruments''' are [[tool]]s that can be [[applied]] to produce music, causing some sort of effect. Instruments in ''[[NetHack]]'' fall into two categories: ''[[tonal instrument]]s'', which can play tunes (including the [[passtune]]), and ''[[atonal instrument]]s'', which cannot.

Some instruments are magical&mdash;they have effects beyond what their ordinary equivalent would yield. When they are uncharged, they behave identically to that equivalent. Every non-magical musical instrument except the [[bugle]] has at least one magical counterpart. Elven Priests and Wizards start with a non-magical musical instrument.

If you are [[stun]]ned, [[confused]], or [[hallucinating]], you cannot play tunes with any instrument; you will always improvise when playing a tonal instrument.{{refsrc|src/music.c|700|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Also, if you are stunned or confused, magical instruments (except the Bell of Opening{{refsrc|src/apply.c|3681|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Bells call <code>use_bell()</code>, not <code>do_play_instrument()</code> like other instruments.}}) behave like their non-magical counterparts and do not consume charges when used.{{refsrc|src/music.c|481|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

For example, you can play a game of NetHack in a text-mode terminal, and record everything that NetHack shows. [[nethack.alt.org]] and [[hardfought.org]] record all games.

ttyrec files can be played back with several programs:

|-

|}

== ttyrec format ==

A ttyrec consists of many frames. Each frame is made up of a twelve-byte header and an arbitrarily long data block. The twelve-byte header contains two pieces of information: how much data is in this frame and a timestamp. The timestamp is very precise; it has microsecond precision. The header bytes are aligned like so:

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C
 \-----/ \-----/ \-----/
   sec     usec    len

The bytes are in little-endian order (meaning least significant bytes first). You can portably read and process frames like this, in C:

 while (fread(header, 1, 12, stdin) == 12)
 {
   sec  = (((((header[ 3] << 8) | header[ 2]) << 8) | header[1]) << 8) | header[0];
   usec = (((((header[ 7] << 8) | header[ 6]) << 8) | header[5]) << 8) | header[4];
   len  = (((((header[11] << 8) | header[10]) << 8) | header[9]) << 8) | header[8];
 
   received = fread(data, 1, len, stdin)
   if (len != received)
     break;
 
   /* process data */
 }
 
 /* either the ttyrec is done or we had an error */

The '''squeaky board''' is a [[trap]] that wakes nearby sleeping monsters.

==Generation==
Squeaky boards can be generated on most levels. They are also guaranteed on the final level of the [[Samurai quest]], the final level of the [[Valkyrie quest]], certain versions of [[Medusa's Island]], the [[Fake Wizard's Tower]] and the real [[Wizard's Tower]].

Each squeaky board has an associated note: it may be any of the following{{refsrc|src/trap.c|1566|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}:
<div style="column-count:3;-moz-column-count:3;-webkit-column-count:3">
* "C note"
* "D flat"
* "D note"
* "E flat"
* "E note"
* "F note"
* "F sharp"
* "G note"
* "G sharp"
* "A note"
* "B flat"
* "B note"
</div>

No two boards on the same level will squeak with the same note unless there are at least 13 squeaky boards on the level.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|356|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Effects==
A squeaky board is triggered if you (or a monster) steps on it without [[flying]] or [[levitating]]. When triggered, the board wakes up nearby monsters.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1054|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on player}} {{refsrc|src/mon.c|2263|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on monsters}}

For you, "nearby" means within a distance of <span class="nowrap">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid; padding:0 0.1em;">20 &times; XL</span></span>{{refsrc|src/mon.c|3046|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}. (For example, level 5 gives a 10-square radius, level 10 gives 14, and level 15 gives 17.)

For monsters, "nearby" means that the distance is less than <span class="nowrap">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid; padding:0 0.1em;">40</span></span> (a 6-square radius){{refsrc|src/mon.c|3053|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}.

==Removal==
Squeaky boards can be untrapped using the #untrap command. You must select a [[potion of oil]] (which will be consumed) or a charged [[can of grease]] (one charge will be consumed).

==Strategy==
Since squeaky boards do not directly cause damage, they are often harmless. However stepping on a squeaky board can potentially wake up the monsters in a [[treasure zoo]] or similar [[special room]]s, causing them to seek you out before you are ready to fight them. On the special levels where they are guaranteed, squeaky boards can often wake up enemies such as [[Medusa]], the [[Wizard of Yendor]] and [[Ashikaga Takauji]] (who will wield the [[Tsurugi of Muramasa]] and possibly bisect you if he wakes up).

The unique note of a squeaky board can potentially help you pinpoint a monster's location.

Untrapping a squeaky board is probably not worth it, as there are better uses for both oil and grease.

==History==
Squeaky boards were added in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

The ability to distinguish boards by note was added in 2006<ref>https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/ab947c6b651df8f4dd7fbd79bb3d4dedd8a405c1</ref>. It was inspired by the encyclopedia entry, which was included much earlier. The feature existed in the [[leaked development version]], where it was listed as "multiple squeaks for squeaky boards" in the changelog. The feature was officially released in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

&&%s&& %s Rust trap {147834 2022-08-22T02:56:16Z {4000978 Aximili} explicit references block {{trap
 |name=rust trap
 |color=blue
 |generation=Anywhere
 |effect=[[wet]]s items
}}

A '''rust trap''' is a [[trap]] that sprays you with water, making your items [[wet]] and possibly [[rust]]ing them.

== Effects ==
{{main|Wet}}
=== On the player ===
Any worn or wielded item can potentially become wet. For unprotected [[iron]] items, this will cause rusting. Whenever the trap is activated, it randomly picks an armor slot to target, instead of looping over every armor slot. This means no item is strictly 'guaranteed' to become wet. 

If you are [[polymorph]]ed into an [[iron golem]], you will take damage equal to your monster form's maximum HP, killing your monster form and reverting you to your natural form. The [[half physical damage]] extrinsic applies. {{refsrc|src/trap.c|1118|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

=== On monsters ===
Items worn or wielded are affected, similarly to those of the player.

[[Gremlin]]s like to use these traps to multiply. Iron golems will be instantly destroyed by these traps. {{refsrc|src/trap.c|2320|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

== Remove ==
[[Dig]] a pit into the ground while standing on the trap, then fill the pit.

== Strategy ==
In the early game, you should wear a [[cloak]] to protect your body armor.  

You can use a rust trap as an infinite, if somewhat slow, source of blanking scrolls and spellbooks and diluting potions, by wielding them, removing any other rustable gear, and repeatedly triggering the trap.

== History ==
Rust traps were added in [[NetHack 1.3d]]

== Messages ==
{{message|A gush of water hits you on the <body part>!|Your armor in the corresponding slot takes water damage.}}
{{message|A gush of water hits you!|The trap hit your body armor slot, or you are an iron golem.}}
{{message|You are covered with rust!|You are an iron golem and were hit by the trap. Your monster form will be killed unless you have [[half physical damage]].}}
{{message|A gush of water hits <monster> on the <body part>!|A monster's armor in the corresponding slot takes water damage.}}
