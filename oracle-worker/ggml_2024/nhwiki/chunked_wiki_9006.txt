The '''gray dragon''', {{monsym|gray dragon}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It has a younger form in the '''baby gray dragon''', {{monsym|baby gray dragon}}. The gray dragon has magic resistance both intrinsically and from [[Gray dragon scales|its scales]], and its breath weapon fires magic missiles; these missiles are not affected by the [[half spell damage]] property. Its corpse does not give any intrinsics.

==Generation==
{{main|Dragon#Generation}}
Players will not see baby gray dragons through normal random [[monster creation]] outside of [[Monster frequency|aligned branches]] and levels such as the [[Oracle]] and [[Sokoban]], and they can also be hatched from dragon [[egg]]s. Adult gray dragons start appearing around the midway depths of the dungeon; gray dragons can be generated in [[throne room]]s as early as dungeon level 15, and may appear when a [[throne]] at this depth or lower is [[loot]]ed.{{reffunc|mkroom.c|courtmon}} Gray dragons can be created if a lawful spellcaster casts the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]].

Gray dragons have a {{frac|3}} of dropping a set of +0 uncursed [[gray dragon scales]] along with their [[corpse]] ({{frac|20}} if the dragon was [[revive]]d).

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Dragon#Strategy]]''
Among a monster class of powerful fighters, the gray dragon is the only one with intrinsic [[magic resistance]], which compensates for its low [[monster magic resistance|MR stat]] in a few areas. However, this does not stop elemental damage, nor does it fully protect them from a [[wand of sleep]] [[ray]] - this thankfully leaves the player with quite a few options when dealing with them. Its scales also provide magic resistance, making them desirable targets of [[reverse genocide]] for characters seeking [[gray dragon scale mail]] to complement their [[reflection]] (e.g., from a [[shield of reflection|shield]] or [[amulet of reflection|amulet]]).

Taming does not factor in player-style magic resistance, and as such the [[spell of charm monster]] is a good way to obtain one as a [[pet]]. Gray dragons compete with [[silver dragons]] as a choice of pet or steed: both possess flight, breath weapons, and immunity to [[wand of death|death]] [[Finger of death|rays]]. The gray dragon's magic resistance additionally stops them being transformed by [[polymorph trap]]s (especially when [[riding]]), and it is somewhat common for the gray dragon or its baby form to be the end result of leading pets onto the trap repeatedly. However, its low speed and lack of elemental resistances can still be a major drawback, and the silver dragon's reflection provides additional immunity to elemental rays. In addition, a gray dragon can still [[polymorph]] if it eats a [[chameleon]] or [[doppelganger]] corpse.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Pets will no longer eat corpses that make them polymorph, unless they are starving or on the verge of becoming untame.}}

==History==
[[NetHack 2.3e]] introduces the gray dragon along with all of the other modern dragon types and their breath weapons, except for silver.

[[NetHack 3.0.0]] introduces baby gray dragons alongside the other baby dragons. This version also distinguishes all color dragons, their younger stages and their corpses, and introduces dragon scale mail (including GDSM).

[[NetHack 3.1.0]] introduces gray dragon scales along with the other colors, as well as the current method of obtaining dragon scale mail.

==Variants==
{{main|Dragon#Variants}}
Variants of ''NetHack'' often subject dragons to extensive changes, including the gray dragon.

===Biodiversity patch===
In the [[biodiversity patch]], the gray dragon is the only monster in the class that is not renamed.

===SLASH'EM===
{{Main|Dragon (SLASH'EM)}}
As with all other dragons in [[SLASH'EM]], baby gray dragons have a base level of 4 instead of 12, and can be encountered via random generation in ordinary levels with a [[frequency of 2 - they are also eligible for creation on many levels that generate random {{white|D}} on level creation. Adult gray dragons have a base level of 18 instead of 15.

Baby gray dragons hit as a +1 weapon, and adults hit as a +3 weapon. Adult gray dragons will not turn [[traitor]] while tame.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], all dragons have their breaths, resistances, and colors randomized, allowing any non-[[chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)|chromatic dragon]] to appear as gray.

The '''purple worm''' is a [[monster]] in [[NetHack]].  It is a popular [[pet]] due to its [[engulfing]] attack, which can kill any monster that is [[large]] or smaller in one hit ("Burrrrp!").

Purple worms will eat [[shrieker]]s on sight; the reason given for this is that purple worms enjoy eating shriekers. {{refsrc|src/mon.c|1391|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

When polymorphed into a purple worm, you [[Warned of monster type|sense shriekers on the level]].

== Generation ==
1/13 of the monsters a shrieker summons with its shriek are purple worms; this can rarely cause a purple worm to appear very early in the dungeon.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Baby purple worms now appear in place of adult purple worms when the latter would be out of depth. Baby purple worms also sense shriekers.}}

== Strategy ==

===Combat===
Purple worms tend to be dangerous if you are unprepared. This is because the purple worm can engulf you, and as soon that happens it will start to [[digest]] you ("The purple worm digests you!"). If you are not able to kill the purple worm fast, it will kill you. To ensure survival after being engulfed, immediately zap a [[wand of digging]]. The purple worm will have its health points dropped to 1, so one hit will get rid of it. See also [[engulfing]]. If you are wielding a cockatrice or chickatrice corpse, stoning the purple worm while inside will give the message: '''"You jump through an opening in the new statue of a purple worm."'''

Wearing a [[ring of slow digestion]] will prevent a purple worm from killing you via engulfing, causing it to spit you out near-immediately.

Ranged attacks are of course also an option.

===Leaving pets near purple worms===
Be careful when leaving pets around purple worms, as they will run up to the worm and promptly be engulfed. Pets that are engulfed die instantly. This is a good way to lose a very powerful pet. This does not apply to pets that are being ridden. ''However'', if a purple worm engulfs you while you are riding, it will force you to dismount and your pet will be vulnerable.

===As pets===
Purple worms make powerful pets, as they can instantly kill things by engulfing them. Unfortunately, they are extremely vulnerable to [[shapeshifter]]s because engulfing them alive or eating their corpse will polymorph the worm.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Pets will no longer eat shapeshifter corpses unless they are starving or on the verge of untaming.}}

Pet worms can level quickly and reach levels beyond their normal maximum by engulfing [[wraiths]].

In addition, some players reverse-genocide purple worms when they get to the Astral Plane, tame them, and send them out (usually with a wand of teleportation) to thin the hordes.

===Polymorph===
Polymorphing yourself into a purple worm allows you to dispatch even elusive and powerful enemies, such as the dreaded [[arch-lich]], in a single turn by engulfing and digesting them -- so long as you are not wearing a [[ring of slow digestion]]. The lack of [[limb]]s, however, impedes prolonged progress in this state, and you must take special care not to swallow deadly prey such as a [[cockatrice]].  Note that when you engulf a wraith, you only get the normal XP for the kill, and do not gain a level like a pet does.


{{upcoming|3.7.0|The hero may get the normal secondary effects from eating a corpse, including intrinsics and/or level gain from wraith corpses, from swallowing a foe in a purple worm polyform.}}

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
A gargantuan version of the harmless rain-worm, the purple worm poses a huge threat to the ordinary adventurer.  It is known to swallow whole and digest its victims within only a few minutes.  These worms are always on guard, sensitive to the most minute vibrations in the earth, but may also be awakened by a remote shriek.

&&%s&& %s Wand of cancellation {140878 2021-06-13T04:46:32Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* FIQHack */ Link wand balance patch {{wand
 |name=cancellation
 |cost=200
 |type=beam
 |maxcharges=8
 |abundance=4.5%
 |spell=cancellation
}}

A '''wand of cancellation''' emits a [[beam]] which [[cancellation|cancels]] any monsters or objects it hits. Monsters are entitled to a [[Magic resistance (monster)|resistance check]] against the effect.

Putting a charged wand of cancellation (or a bag containing a wand of cancellation) into a [[bag of holding]] will cause a magical explosion that will destroy the bag and ''everything'' in it. Zapping a bag of holding, however, will either unbless or uncurse it, and will have no effect on the contents.

==Effects==
{{main|Cancellation}}
The wand of cancellation has a number of complicated effects. Among these effects, it will:

* uncurse and unbless items
* neutralize enchantments and charges of most items
* change most [[potions]] into {{of|potion|water}}; {{of|potion|sickness|and=1|see invisible}} into {{of|potion|fruit juice}}; {{of|potion|booze|and=1|oil}} just become uncursed
* blank [[scroll]]s and [[spellbook]]s
* neutralize the special attacks of many [[monsters]]
* kill a [[clay golem]] instantly by erasing its writing

[[Apply]]ing a wand of cancellation will break it and cause a damaging magical explosion that also cancels all monsters and objects in a 3x3 square around you. See [[breaking wands]] for details.

==Identification==

[[Wand#Engrave-identification|Engraving over a writing in the dust]] gives the message "The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!" This can be either a wand of cancellation, {{of|wand|make invisible}}, or {{of|wand|teleportation}}.

Do not zap yourself with an unidentified wand that makes an engraving disappear; if it is a wand of cancellation, you will cancel all items carried in your inventory (except wands of cancellation).

If you have a pet without a special attack (such as a kitten), you can zap an unidentified wand that makes engravings disappear. If the pet disappears, it is either {{of|wand|teleportation}} (and you can find the pet later in the level) or {{of|wand|make invisible}} (which you can see if you have the [[see invisible]] intrinsic). To confirm, you can use a [[stethoscope]]; the information line from it will say that it has been canceled. Monsters have a chance of resisting cancellation, so do not rely on the above test before zapping yourself.

Another means is to drop an item that can be visibly canceled, and then zap it with the wand. If it vanishes, then the wand is {{of|wand|teleportation}}; if it remains unchanged, then the wand is {{of|wand|make invisible}}; otherwise it is cancellation. Good test items include useless non-blank scrolls, known blessed or cursed objects, potions other than water, and items with known enchantment.

==Messages==

{{message|You are covered in sparkling lights!|You've just been zapped by a wand of cancellation. This is possible in some variants, but not in vanilla.}}
{{message|You feel a strange sense of loss.|Having been hit, the wand has canceled an item in your inventory.}}
{{message|The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!|You engraved with a wand of cancellation, {{of|wand|teleportation}}, or {{of|wand|make invisible}} where there was an existing engraving, or with a [[wand of cold]] where there is an existing burned engraving.}}

==Strategy==

===Avoiding wand explosion===
Exploding wands of cancellation are a very bad thing. Not only do you lose your wand, you will be caught in the subsequent explosion and suffer 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;charges damage. Wands of cancellation can explode as a result of a number of triggers, some of which do not apply to other wands. The following is a (probably not exhaustive) list of these triggers:
*Breaking it
*Zapping when cursed (1% chance)
*Charging when previously recharged
*Being hit by [[shock]] damage
*Putting a charged wand of cancellation (or a bag containing a wand of cancellation) in a bag of holding causes a magical explosion which destroys the wand along with the bag and everything in it. This explosion, however, does ''not'' cancel your inventory, though it is still a very [[bad idea]].

A large part of surviving ''NetHack'' is forming good habits. Do not pick up a wand of cancellation unless you need it, even if you do not (yet) have a [[bag of holding]]. If you do pick it up, make [[menucolors]] display it in an eye-catching warning color. Destroying the contents of your [[bag of holding]] can be a game-ending mistake. In vanilla, it is safe to leave it since no monster can use cancellation.

Of course, the best tip is to read all the text and make sure you understand what you are doing at all times. If you keep making simple mistakes such as placing a wand of cancellation in your bag of holding, then slow down and think before you type. However, even attentive players face a slight chance of accident, and in a long game, probabilities do add up.

The {{kbd|!}}{{kbd|"}}{{kbd|$}}{{kbd|%}}{{kbd|/}}{{kbd|(}}{{kbd|)}}{{kbd|{{=}}}}{{kbd|?}}{{kbd|[}}{{kbd|]}} keys can and should be habitually [[menu_controls|used at the loot menu]] (if you are using the [[tty]] or [[curses interface]]s). This makes gameplay faster, and handling dangerous items much less prone to mistakes. 

You could reduce the chance of blowing up your bag of holding by embedding the wand into multiple sacks; seven are optimum.

The safest way to deal with a wand of cancellation is to get a spare plain sack or oilskin sack, name it something eye-catching, and put the wand in there instead of keeping it out in the open or accidentally putting it in a bag of holding.

On the other hand, this wand is great to uncurse worn stuff&mdash;just drop or stash everything else first. If this is your plan for the case where your [[two-handed weapon]] gets cursed, carry the wand in the open.

There also exists the opposite school of thought: Always pick up a wand of cancellation, as it is a great way to force yourself to pause and read the text before blindly mashing some key. This is the ''NetHack'' equivalent of placing a bomb in every car&mdash;hopefully, people will drive more carefully, reducing total casualties.

===Packorder===
Placing a wand of cancellation inside of a [[bag of holding]] will destroy the bag, its contents, and everything you put in before the wand that turn. What objects go in first is determined by [[packorder]], and within each object class the inventory letters.

Players who choose to carry these wands could keep their most valuable items outside their [[bag of holding]], and use [[packorder]] and [[adjust]] to make their "rod of disaster" go in first.

However, losing the contents of the bag is usually the worst problem. Also, items you carry in the open can be destroyed, cursed, or stolen, so this trick hardly makes your valuables safer.

==Variants==

===AceHack and NetHack 4===
In [[AceHack]] and [[NetHack 4]], placing a wand of cancellation in a bag of holding will cancel the wand, rather than destroying the bag. It's still a bad idea, but less game-ruining.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], monsters may zap wands of cancellation at you, reducing your current [[energy]] by 10d10 and your maximum energy by 10, which may interfere with your ability to use spells and other special abilities.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], monsters may zap the wand of cancellation at you, canceling some of your items. The effects of the wand are prevented if you have magic resistance. The effect is not the same as zapping yourself; every item in your inventory has a 1 in 24 chance of being canceled.{{refsrc|zap.c|2726|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} If you are polymorphed and are not wearing an amulet of unchanging, you return to human form and lose current and maximum HP equal to the monster level of the form you were in. <!-- If this would bring your maximum HP below 1, it is set to 1. (Someone check this. It doesn't reset current HP, so wouldn't you die regardless?) -->

If you are caught in the explosion of a wand of cancellation, it will cancel all objects in your open inventory. This makes the wand especially dangerous to carry, as it can explode as a result of [[shock]] damage.

Identifying this wand is easier in SLASH'EM, owing to the addition of [[Invisible item (SLASH'EM)|invisible items]]. You can zap any junk item with a wand that makes engravings vanish to unambiguously identify the wand; make invisible will make the item invisible, teleportation will teleport it, and cancellation will leave it visibly unchanged.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], monsters may use a wand of cancellation against you, with the same effects as in SLASH'EM.

===GruntHack===
Monsters in [[GruntHack]] will zap wands of cancellation at the player, randomly canceling their inventory items. This attack cannot be defended against in any way; neither [[magic resistance]] nor [[magic cancellation]] helps.

===FIQHack===
Monsters in [[FIQHack]] will zap wands of cancellation at the player. If the player has [[magic resistance]], it will protect against the zap from monsters with lower [[Wands Balance Patch|wand skill]]. Without magic resistance, or for particularly skilled wand users, the player will be canceled, preventing usage of energy as well as other changes similar to canceled monsters. This is considered a [[major trouble]]; it can be cured by praying, drinking a noncursed [[potion of gain energy]], reading a noncursed [[scroll of charging]] while confused, or being caught in a [[magic trap]]'s magical explosion.

===Slash'EM Extended===
Monsters will zap this wand at you, which may cancel some items in your inventory; magic resistance provides partial protection from that effect. The wand will be identified if you saw the monster that zapped you. If the player is zapped by this wand or zaps themselves with it, a random intrinsic property may also be lost, similar to being hit by a [[gremlin]].

Regardless of your [[alignment]], [[altar|Sacrificing]] a cat corpse is harmless ([[Sacrifice#Sacrificing_pets|though sacrificing a pet corpse is not]]).

The famous "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" can sometimes be found in a [[large box]] dropped by a [[quantum mechanic]]  - either dead or alive. Just as in the thought experiment, its state is determined only the moment you observe it by opening the box.

The '''kitten''' is one of three possible starting [[pet]]s, the others being [[dog]]s and [[pony|ponies]] (for [[Knight]]s).  They will [[grow up]] into housecats after they kill enough monsters.

The kitten and its grown up forms are sometimes better fighters than newly started characters, and can be used to fight for you in the early stages of the game.  Nevertheless, they may be more vulnerable than you against passive attacks, such as [[acid]]ic monsters or [[floating eye]]s.  They are also extremely vulnerable to [[falling rock trap]]s and [[rolling boulder trap]]s and many die from these within the first hundred turns of a game.

The '''housecat''' is a grown-up kitten and is therefore usually encountered as a early [[player]]'s [[pet]]. They are capable of growing up into large cats.

The housecat has the same attack as the kitten, but is slightly slower, and has a higher [[monster level]]. In other aspects it's mostly the same as the kitten. As with their brethren, they are excellent fighters to have as companions to early game characters, but remain vulnerable to [[passive attack]]s.

The '''large cat''' is the final form of a grown-up housecat, and is therefore usually encountered as a [[player]]'s [[pet]] (especially with early game characters, as they are easy to obtain by training a starting kitten). It is [[strong]], therefore pet large cats can [[apport]] heavy objects, such as a [[large box]] with not too heavy contents.

As with their brethren, they are excellent fighters to have as companions to early game characters, but remain vulnerable to [[passive attack]]s.  Eventually, it may be worthwhile to attempt to upgrade your large cat to another monster using a [[polymorph trap]], especially if you have more than one pet.
{{clear}}
==Pet cats==
Cats are one of the most common pets.  Many [[role]]s begin the game with one.

Taming wild cats is usually easy, because all sizes of cat are considered [[domestic animal]]s. Throwing a meaty [[treat]], a safe fresh meat-based corpse, or processed human food at a hostile or peaceful cat will tame it. Throwing any other comestible at a cat will at least render it peaceful, with the exception of [[cream pie]]s and [[egg]]s (which will break on impact).

All meaty treats ([[tripe ration]]s or [[meatball]]s) can be used to train your cat to [[apport|fetch]].

You can #[[chat]] with your cat to get an idea of how it is feeling:
* it will yowl if it is caught in a [[trap]], [[confused]], fleeing, or [[tameness]] is getting low.
* if the cat is [[leash]]ed, and there is a [[trap]] next to it, it will whimper without you #chatting to it. This works even if the trap is undetected.
* if it will be hungry soon (1000 turns or less), it will mew.
* if it is hungry, it will meow.
* the rest of the time it will purr.

{{encyclopedia|
Well-known quadruped domestic animal from the family of
predatory felines (_Felis ochreata domestica_), with a thick,
soft pelt; often kept as a pet.  Various folklores have the
cat associated with magic and the gods of ancient Egypt.
 
So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people
awakened at dawn - behold!  Every cat was back at his
accustomed hearth!  Large and small, black, grey, striped,
yellow and white, none was missing.  Very sleek and fat did
the cats appear, and sonorous with purring content.

{{weapon|tile=[[image:athame.png]]|name=athame|smalldmg=1d4|largedmg=1d3|tohit=<nowiki>+2</nowiki>|skill=dagger|cost=4|weight=10|material=iron}}

'''Athames''' are almost completely identical to [[dagger]]s, even using the dagger weapon skill. However, athames are exceptionally suited for [[engraving]]. Any ''[[BUC#Noncursed|non-cursed]]'' athame will not dull from engraving,  and will engrave at up to 19 letters per turn (or up to 9 letters [[Engraving#Speed|instantaneously]]) rather than 1 letter per turn. (Any athame that has an enchantment of -3 or lower is too dull to engrave with, regardless of [[BUC|blessed/uncursed/cursed status]].) They are useful for writing messages and engraving "[[Elbereth]]".

==Generation==
Athames are extremely rare.  They are never randomly generated on the dungeon floor, in [[shop]]s, or as ordinary [[death drop]]s.{{refsrc|src/objects.c|166|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}  Apart from the [[artifact weapon|artifact]] [[Magicbane]], which may be received as a [[sacrifice gift]] (especially for [[Wizard]]s, as their guaranteed first gift), athames are only generated on [[master lich]]es (with a 6 in 91, or about 6% chance), [[arch lich]]es (with a 2 in 9 or about 22% chance),{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|663|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=liches generated with athames}} and [[Wizard (player monster)|wizard player monster]]s,{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|246|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} including Newt, a prisoner on the [[Wizard quest]] (with 37.5% chance).  A player monster's athame will be [[erodeproof]] or [[greased]] (but not both) with a 1 in 3 probability of each, and have a random [[enchantment]] between +0 and +3, or between +4 and +8 on the [[Astral Plane]].

If it has not already been generated, Magicbane may appear as the athame of an arch-lich (not a master lich{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|665|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=master lich athames are generated by {{function|makemon.c|mongets|x}}}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1773|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=mongets always passes <tt>FALSE</tt> as the <tt>artif</tt> parameter to {{function|mkobj.c|mksobj|x}}}}), with a 1 in 260 chance,{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|668|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=1/13 chance of <tt>TRUE</tt> being passed as <tt>artif</tt> parameter}}{{refsrc|src/mkobj.c|762|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=1/20 chance of a possibly-artifact athame being Magicbane}} or a player monster on the Astral Plane, with a 50% chance.

You might also find an athame on a [[bones level]], especially if the decedent owned Magicbane and the artifact has already been generated in your game.

Notwithstanding these possibilities, non-[[atheist]] Wizards are likely to receive Magicbane long before they ever see a non-artifact athame.

==Strategy==
{{main|Engraving}}
You should formally identify your athame's BUC status as soon as possible so that the game will show when it gets cursed, e.g. by a spellcasting monster.

Beware: an athame found in [[bones]] or dropped by a [[lich]] might be [[cursed]]. If it is, attempting to engrave [[Elbereth]] in a dangerous situation will [[Paralysis#Helplessness|immobilize]] you for a few turns and probably kill you. If you can't spare identify to check, you could dip it in a [[potion of holy water]] to make sure it's at least uncursed, or try engraving a single letter with it&mdash;if you get "Your athame gets dull. You finish engraving.", be sure to uncurse it before you use it any more!

==Origin==
The encyclopedia entry gives a brief description of the athame's origin as a tool used by practitioners of Wicca, though the blade is not required to be double-edged.  It is not specifically used as a utility tool for cutting, much less as a weapon (in fact, athames might have blunted tips to prevent accidental wounds), but as a ritual object used to trace pentagrams and circles in preparation for rituals.  In NetHack, this translates into a blade suitable for making ([[Elbereth|protective]]) engravings.

==History==
Until [[NetHack 3.2.3]], a +1 athame was the starting weapon for [[Wizard]]s.{{refsrc|u_init.c|156|comment=no source for 3.2.3 on the wiki|version=NetHack 3.2.0}}  The influential [[Wizard Patch]] changed the starting weapon to the stronger but less utilitarian [[quarterstaff]].  This may have been to compensate for the Wizard's increased power from the redesigned spellcasting system, which allowed virtually unlimited casting of spells.

This patch was merged completely into mainline NetHack in version [[NetHack 3.3.0|3.3.0]],{{refsrc|u_init.c|161|version=NetHack 3.3.0}} and wizards have begun their journey with staves ever since.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] adds two specialist spellcaster roles, the [[Flame Mage]] and [[Ice Mage]], with their own respective artifact athames, [[Firewall]] and [[Deep Freeze]].  Their [[player monster]]s, as well as the [[Necromancer]] player monster, have the same 37.5% chance of getting an athame as the [[Wizard (player monster)|wizard]].{{refsrc|mplayer.c|220|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

Two of each of these player monsters, along with two wizards, are members of the [[Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers]], if it is created, so non-artifact athames are more likely to appear.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], athames are most useful for inscribing [[Wards (dNethack)|wards]].  Wizards in dNetHack begin with a -1 athame, perhaps secondhand.  

[[The Pen of the Void]] is the combined first gift and [[quest artifact]] of the [[Binder (role in dNethack)|Binder]] role, an athame useful for engraving the seals used to bind [[Binder (role in dNethack)#Abilities|spirits of the Void]].  The Pen deals [[double damage]] after the [[Quest]] is completed, and has additional effects if spirits are bound into the weapon itself.

==Encyclopaedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|The consecrated ritual knife of a Wiccan initiate (one of
four basic tools, together with the wand, chalice and

black-handled, cross-hilted dagger of between six and

The '''mail daemon''' is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It has many unusual properties, some of which are related to its very specific purpose of delivering [[scroll of mail|mail]] to players. Mail daemons are not valid forms for [[polymorph]].

==Generation==
The mail daemon is not normally randomly generated. On multi-user systems where the <code>MAIL</code> [[compile-time option]] is defined, the mail daemon will deliver a scroll of mail when the player receives an email. Reading the scroll will typically launch the user's preferred mail reader. After closing the reader, the player may continue their game.

On a [[public server]], users observing another player's session may be able to send messages to that player. The message is displayed in the in-game message bar when the scroll is read.

MS-DOS and Amiga are single-user operating systems with no built-in mail support. On these platforms, a mail demon will appear every 2000-5000 turns, delivering a scroll with a meaningless "junk" message.

It is possible to [[wish]] for a [[statue]] of a mail daemon, which can then be re-animated by casting {{spell of|stone to flesh}}.

Mail daemons will not appear if <code>MAIL</code> is undefined when compiling the game, or if the [[mail (option)|mail option]] is set to <code>false</code>. If <code>MAIL</code> is not defined, any attempts to reference them within that game (e.g. wishing for a statue, generating them in [[wizard mode]]) will treat them as a non-existent monster; the [[encyclopedia]] entry for mail daemons will still be present. The official [[Windows]] binaries do not define <code>MAIL</code>.

==Delivering mail==
When an item of mail needs to be delivered, the daemon is placed on a square just out of sight of the player, rushes over to their location and moving through any monster in its path - upon reaching the player, it hands them the scroll, rushes back to its starting square and disappears. If it cannot maneuver next to the player for some reason, it will "throw" the scroll to the player. This all takes place within the space of one move - as the mail daemon is capable of flight, swimming, can [[see invisible]] and is [[breathless]], it can deliver mail in any environment.

On public servers such as [[nethack.alt.org]], a user may observe other users' games and communicate with them by sending mail. The player cannot send mail back to the spectator, but the # command can be used to type arbitrary messages visible to the observing user(s) - this command does not need to be executed, only seen by the spectator(s).

==Strategy==
{{main|Mail}}
While the mail daemon themselves will not factor in the strategy of a mass majority of players, some seek out ways to successfully kill them (primarily for bragging rights). The only way to do this is to stone to flesh a mail daemon statue, as mentioned above; the resulting mail daemon will normally disappear in one turn unless attacked. If you step away from them after attacking, they will also disappear. A player looking to kill the mail daemon must do so quickly, keeping in mind that they possess all forms of elemental resistance.

Killing a mail daemon will automatically [[genocide]] them with no announcement, breaking [[Conduct#Genocideless|genocideless conduct]] and preventing any further mail delivery for the duration of that game.

The services of mail daemons can also be used to generate scrolls of mail for certain somewhat-niche purposes, such as using them to propel yourself while [[levitating]].<ref>https://nhqdb.alt.org/?2390</ref>

==Origin==
The monster and its [[default tile]] are based on a pun - on Unix-like operating systems, a [[wikipedia:Daemon (Unix)|daemon]] is a program that runs in the background, performing various tasks such as managing log files, performing timed maintenance tasks or answering incoming network connection requests. The program responsible for receiving mail and dispatching it to the correct location is commonly referred to as the "mail daemon".

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], a mail daemon could be created when creating random demons on a special level; these mail daemons would immediately disappear as soon as the player moved. This was [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-415|bug C343-415]]. 

== Messages ==
{{message|Gangway! Look out! Pardon me!|The daemon pushed past another monster.}}
{{message|Excuse me.|The daemon pushed past you to get to a square near you.}}
{{message|This place's too crowded. I'm outta here.|The daemon left because it couldn't get close enough to you.}}
{{message|<Hello>, <player>! I have some mail for you.|The daemon delivered a scroll of mail.}}
{{message|Catch!|The daemon couldn't get next to you, so it threw the scroll from a distance.}}
{{message|I'm late!|A mail daemon that was not generated via normal means disappeared from the level.}}

==UnNetHack==
In [[UnNetHack]], in addition to delivering mail, the mail daemon can also deliver one hint scroll per game (assuming that this option is enabled). This "helpful hint" behavior has earned the mail daemon the nickname "Unclippy - the helpful hint daemon" (as a pejorative reference to the infamous Microsoft Word "helper", Clippy).

'''Dwarvish mattocks''' are effective weapons; much more so than [[pick-axe]]s, the only other weapons in the pick-axe class. They have some drawbacks, however &mdash; mattocks are not only heavier than pick-axes, but also require [[Two-handed|two hands]] to wield. Furthermore, their -1 [[to-hit]] "bonus" can make it difficult to hit enemies with them until you maximize your [[Luck]]. 

When [[identification|unidentified]], a mattock appears as a '''broad pick'''. A [[shopkeeper]] will identify it for you by asking you to leave "your mattock" behind.

==Generation==
Considered [[weapon]]s rather than [[tool]]s, dwarvish mattocks can be randomly generated under the same circumstances as [[weapon]]s (on the floor, as [[death drop]]s, and in [[shop]]s), and make up about 1.3% of all randomly generated weapons.

Mattocks are most commonly generated in the inventory of [[Dwarf#List of Dwarf monsters|dwarves]], including [[dwarf lord|lord]]s and [[dwarf king|king]]s.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|376|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Mattocks can also be generated in the inventory of watchmen and soldiers.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|191|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=eligible weapons include those from [[partisan]] to [[bec-de-corbin]] in the objects list}}{{refsrc|src/objects.c|249|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=mattocks are in this range}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Mattocks no longer generate as starting weapons on watchmen and soldiers.<ref>[https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/da859c5eb88e17d04ec2bb37e2c12842e9f4c4a9 fix github issue #623 - soldiers and mattocks]</ref>}}

==Strategy==

The mattock, besides being two-handed, heavier, and a superior weapon, has the same advantages and drawbacks as the pick-axe, namely:

* They can be (a)pplied (this wields the mattock!) to dig through walls or floors, or to break [[boulder]]s or [[statue]]s into rocks (Archeologists are penalized for breaking historic statues). Occasionally a [[spellbook]] or other useful item will be found in the remains of a statue. For more information, see the [[pick-axe]] and [[digging]] articles.
* Shopkeepers will not allow you to carry a mattock into a shop unless you hide it within a container. Attempting to throw one into a shop by standing in front of the shopkeeper and throwing it diagonally past him/her will fail, as the shopkeeper will catch it.

Enchanted mattocks are the best naturally-occurring weapons you can give to your [[pet]], provided the pet has a weapon attack, is not wearing a shield, and belongs to a species that has the "[[strong]]" attribute. Pets understand how much damage mattocks can do and will not drop them in favor of other weapons (in practice swapping them out only for artifacts or cockatrice corpses), and their two-handedness is not a drawback.

[[Apply]]ing a mattock or pick-axe will wield it if it was not already wielded.  Wielding it in this manner will not take an extra turn if it you then choose a direction to dig when prompted, and this direction can be toward monsters.  This can be used to your advantage in combination with a other wielded items, such as a [[bullwhip]]: you can apply a bullwhip at a monster to disarm it, then immediately attack on your next turn by applying a mattock, without having to take a turn to wield it.

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

A mattock is an agricultural tool similar to a mining pick.

==Description==
An item that autocurses itself will become cursed regardless of beatitude. The following items will autocurse themselves:

* [[Loadstone]]s (appearance: gray stone)
* [[Helm of opposite alignment|Helms of opposite alignment]] ([[randomized appearance]])
* [[Dunce cap]]s (appearance: [[conical hat]])

The helm and the dunce cap will become cursed when [[wear|worn]] by a player, while the loadstone only becomes cursed when dropped - that is, picking up an uncursed loadstone is perfectly safe. However, since all loadstones are generated cursed (except possibly those in containers), they are still best left alone. If you are not playing as a [[Wizard]] and do not have a [[large]]-sized [[pet]](s) that you want to give [[magic cancellation]], you can safely ignore all conical hats - the only other hat that shares that appearance is the [[cornuthaum]], which is only of use to a Wizard or any player with such a pet.

The '''helm of opposite alignment''' is a type of [[magical item|magical]] [[helm]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It has a [[randomized appearance]].

==Generation==
Helms of opposite alignment have a 90% chance of being generated cursed.{{refsrc|src/mkobj.c|993|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}

==Description==
As indicated by the name, a helm of opposite alignment will switch you to the [[alignment]] opposite your current one when worn - this will [[autocurse]] and [[auto-identify]] the helm, remove any divine [[protection]] you have acquired and set your [[alignment record]] to zero, even if it was previously negative.{{refsrc|src/do_wear.c|410|nethack=3.6.7}} Removing the helm will restore your original alignment and remove any protection obtained under your temporary alignment; wearing or removing the helm will never restore any lost points of protection or alignment record.

Attempting to put one on while in the [[Quest]] branch will always fail with a specific message and identify the helm, as will doing so while already permanently converted{{refsrc|src/do_wear.c|1884|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} - this will still remove any divine protection, but does not affect your alignment record.

A [[lawful]] character donning the helm will become [[chaotic]], and a chaotic character donning the helm will become lawful; for [[neutral]] characters, there is a a 50/50 chance of the helm switching them to lawful or chaotic, and each individual helm will always switch to the same alignment.{{refsrc|src/do_wear.c|418|nethack=3.6.7}}

If your [[god]] was angry with you prior to wearing the helm, your "new" god will retain the previous god's anger status. Gods will not consider a worn cursed helm of opposite alignment as trouble, and will not uncurse a worn helm of opposite alignment in order to prevent you from switching allegiance to a different god.{{refsrc|src/pray.c|298|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/pray.c|1132|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} [[Ascend]]ing while wearing a helm of opposite alignment will cut your [[score]] by {{frac|2|3}}.

Monsters can wear this helm, which will autocurse as it does for the player but does not change their alignment{{refsrc|src/worn.c|601|version=NetHack 3.6.7}} - [[aligned priest]]s and [[minion]]s, whose alignments are linked to their god, will refuse to put one on.{{refsrc|src/worn.c|557|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}

==Strategy==
Helms of opposite alignment are among the many reasons that randomly use-testing unidentified helms is a [[bad idea]] - they also share the same base cost as the useful [[helm of brilliance]] and [[helm of telepathy]]. However, most such helms will generate cursed and can be avoided with relative ease, especially through methods such as pet-testing. Even so, be sure to formally [[identify]] a suspected helm of opposite alignment as soon as possible - the 10% chance of one generating noncursed can prove a nasty surprise for an early-game player, since you usually lack any forms of curse removal and [[prayer]] is rendered unreliable.

One primary use of a helm of opposite alignment is for lawful characters to weaken the [[mysterious force]] during a [[speed ascension]], since chaotic characters are not teleported by as many floors when using staircases. Another is on the [[Astral Plane]], where a character willing to use the helm effectively has a {{frac|2|3}} chance of ascending on the first altar they find - this is naturally less reliable for neutral characters compared to other alignments.

The helm has some niche other applications as well - for example, a chaotic character may become lawful to safely traverse the [[Gnomish Mines]] in the early game. The helm can allow characters to obtain [[intelligent artifact]]s of other alignments, including [[dip]]ping for [[Excalibur]].

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, as well as some variants based on those versions, a neutral character would randomly become lawful or chaotic each time they wore the helm, with the result not tied to the individual object. Wearing or removing the helm also did not alter your alignment record, and it is possible for prayer to uncurse a worn helm of opposite alignment.

The mechanics for neutral opposite alignment and alignment record are changed to their modern implementation in [[NetHack 3.6.0]], while prayer uncursing a worn helm of opposite alignment was removed in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

==Messages==
{{message|Your mind oscillates briefly.|You put on a helm of opposite alignment and changed your alignment, identifying the helm.}}
{{message|You narrowly avoid losing all chance at your goal.|As above while in your Quest branch; this will always fail.}}
{{message|You are suddenly overcome with shame and change your mind.|You tried to put on the helm, but failed because your alignment was already permanently converted through other means.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], a chaotic or neutral character can take advantage of the helm of opposite alignment to get tamed lawful [[minion]]s from sacrifice and prayer - including [[deva]]s, [[ki-rin]], [[archon]]s, [[planetar]]s, and [[solar]]s.

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], wearing a helm of opposite alignment halves your alignment record and inverts it: if your alignment record was positive at the time of wearing, it becomes negative, and a negative alignment record becomes positive; removing a worn helm of opposite alignment also inverts your alignment record.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/SporkHack/commit/f6d94071beeec858d3b5ec7d728502df7db08cc6 SporkHack commit f6d9407 - "HoOA now adjusts piety to -(align/2) when you put it on"]</ref> For example, if you have an alignment record of 20 and wear a helm of opposite alignment, then your alignment record becomes -10; if you uncurse or destroy the helm immediately after, your alignment record then becomes 10.

As a result, using a helm of opposite alignment to ascend carries a significant risk in terms of score, as well as perceived legitimacy: if your alignment record is not positive after offering the [[Amulet of Yendor]] (which boosts your alignment record by 10), you are denied the status of demigod(ess) and forced to escape in celestial disgrace.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], helms of opposite alignment essentially function as they do in NetHack 3.4.3.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], ascending using a helm of opposite alignment will always result in a dishonorable ascension.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], wearing or removing a helm of opposite alignment causes you to gradually lose 1 point of alignment record per turn - once your alignment reaches &minus;100, your alignment converts as would normally occur with the helm behaves in vanilla ''NetHack''. Taking the helm off after a complete conversion from it also causes you to gradually lose alignment in the same way until you regain your original alignment.

Having your alignment completely converted in either case resets your [[piety]] (which FIQHack uses to determine gift threshold and crowning) and protection, incurs a &minus;3 Luck penalty and increments prayer timeout by 300 (more) turns.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], it is now possible to convert alignment while already converted through other means. Several mechanics related to the helm of opposite alignment are also altered:<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-032 EvilHack changelog, v0.3.2]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-042 EvilHack changelog, v0.4.2]</ref>

* In addition to not uncursing a worn helm of opposite alignment, your god will never give you the helm as a sacrifice gift.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/9f12aeb8abe3b91e9714e72b89d5a754007c211b EvilHack commit 9f12aeb - "uncursing prayer vs helm of opposite alignment"]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.1/src/pray.c#L325 EvilHack 0.7.1 src/pray.c, line 325]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/8c5b89565af0cee1563a77a48f4361638ffab6b7 EvilHack commit 8c5b895 - "Fix: your deity probably shouldn't gift the player a helm of opposite alignment."]</ref>
* You cannot use the helm to obtain [[Excalibur]] or [[Dirge]] as a [[Knight]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.1/src/pray.c#L1759 EvilHack 0.7.1 src/pray.c, line 1759 (code for Dirge)]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.1/src/pray.c#L1759 EvilHack 0.7.1 src/pray.c, line 1759 (code for Dirge)]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.1/src/fountain.c#L553 EvilHack 0.7.1 src/fountain.c, line 553 (code for Excalibur dipping)]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/ebf4883149563c3dac1afe6ef74fcabfa900bf63 EvilHack commit ebf4883 - "Fix: disallow obtaining Excalibur or Dirge by using a helm of opposite alignment."]</ref>
* Attempting to offer the Amulet to a different deity while using a helm of opposite alignment has a {{frac|3}} chance of your original god noticing the deception.

A '''vampire''', {{monsym|vampire}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Vampires are human [[undead]] that are [[breathless]], [[Intelligent monster|intelligent]] and capable of [[flight]] and [[regeneration]]; they also possess [[sleep resistance]] and [[poison resistance]], and will [[follow]] you to other levels if they are adjacent.

Vampires are [[shapeshifter]]s and can [[polymorph]] at will into [[vampire bat]]s or [[fog cloud]]s they often disguise themselves as the former when outside of the player's sight, and shift into the latter to flow under locked or inaccessible [[door]]s. A vampire killed in either form will revert to their base form. Standing on any [[altar]] [[scare]]s vampires, similar to standing on [[Elbereth]] or a [[scroll of scare monster]].{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|154|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

[[Player]]s in the form of a vampire are [[Warned of monster type|warned of]] any {{monclasslink|@}}, and will turn into [[vampire bat]]s if they polymorph without [[polymorph control]].

==Generation==
All normally-generated vampires are hostile; in addition to random generation, vampires are a somewhat uncommon find in [[graveyard]]s.

At least five vampires are generated in [[Orcus-town]] on level creation.

[[Human (starting race)|Human]] characters killed by a member of the vampire class arise as a vampire instead of a ghost in any bones file that is created.{{refsrc|src/end.c|517|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The mausoleum [[themed room]] may hold a vampire within the 3×3 subroom in the center.}}

==Strategy==
Vampires often make for annoying fights, due to their ability to rob you of [[experience level]]s unless you have [[drain resistance]], e.g. from an artifact weapon like [[Excalibur]]; [[MC]]3 is the next best option in the event you lack this resistance. They can wear armor to bolster their base [[AC]] of 1, though this is usually only a concern with bones files - most vampires will approach you as a vampire bat or be found in fog cloud form, which forces them to drop any armor they would find.

Vampires that shapeshift retain their current HP between forms, making it possible to bring them to low health and wait for them to assume their humanoid forms before finishing them off. A silver weapon with decent enchantment and/or skill level can bring them low in a few hits, and the silver damage applies regardless of their current form.

===As pets===
Vampires are decently strong as pets, and only require two levels to [[grow up]] into [[vampire lord]]s. However, pet vampires will shapeshift as normal unless you are wearing a [[ring of protection from shape changers]] - in their other forms, they are weak fighters that cannot wear armor, and will not shapeshift back to humanoid form unless killed or forced back to normal by the ring. Players planning to keep vampire pets should identify this ring as soon as possible.

Though their hit dice in humanoid form are somewhat mediocre, it remains the vampire's strongest form by far: its good base AC, draining capabilities and access to all armor gives them the potential for high survivability. However, their silver weakness and lack of elemental resistances can easily work against them.

===As a polyform===
Vampires are a decent polyself form for players - they are [[strong]] with 12 speed, can wear the same armor as the player and allow wielding of any non-silver weapon, and you can easily compensate for the lack of elemental resistances. They are also inediate and have regeneration, flight, and breathlessness that you can readily take advantage of. The silver weakness is just as much a danger to you in this form as it is to other vampires, however, and you will need to avoid engaging certain monsters such as [[cockatrices]] in melee, lest your bite attack lead to [[YASD]]. Additionally, most players capable of [[polymorph control|controlled]] polymorph will usually opt for vampire lords, which are similar but strictly better in all aspects.

==History==
Vampires have been present in the game since Hack121, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

The vampire's shapeshifting abilities were added in [[NetHack 3.6.0]]; this makes them somewhat better pets in previous versions and some variants based on them, as they will not shapeshift out of any armor you give them. 

==Messages==
{{main|Vampire (monster class)#Messages}}
[[Chat]]ting to vampires in their humanoid form will produce various responses from them depending on the time of day, the monster's peacefulness and your current form.

==Variants==
Many variants add the [[Vampire (starting race)|vampire]] as a playable race and make some changes to the vampire monster.

===SLASH'EM===
{{main|Vampire (starting race in SLASH'EM)}}
Vampires are a starting [[race]] added in [[SLASH'EM]] - this means that [[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppelgangers]] cannot polymorph into vampires, though they can still polymorph into other members of the vampire monster class.  Player vampires and other players [[polymorph]]ed into undead vampires can fly and do not need to breathe, but they cannot eat solid food and have to rely on fresh blood as a food source.

Player and pet vampires can drain blood from living victims or corpses, or else drink a [[potion of blood]] or vampire blood, as nutritional replacements for rations and the like; drained corpses are still eligible to sacrifice if they are not too old. Vampires in the dungeon may generate with either potion, and will drink non-cursed vampire blood to restore 2-10 HP - they gain nothing from drinking cursed potions. A non-vampire player that quaffs any potion of vampire blood will polymorph into a vampire; they will suffer a −3 alignment penalty if neutral, while lawfuls and [[Monk]]s take a −15 alignment penalty and [[anger]] their [[god]]. The polymorph is "semi-permanent" and has no timeout, lasting until your HP is reduced to 0.

Monster vampires [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|hit monsters as +2 weapons]] and [[Need +x weapon to hit|require a +2 weapon to be hit]]; they are often generated with [[opera cloak]]s, and can provide a valuable method of farming said cloaks, especially if it is the [[randomized appearance]] of a [[cloak of magic resistance]] - the tradeoff lies in these vampires being made harder to dispatch, depending on the cloak. The {{spell of|acid stream}} spell is a good substitute for the {{spell of|magic missile}} spell in such scenarios.

===UnNetHack===
{{main|Vampire (starting race in UnNetHack)}}
As with SLASH'EM, [[UnNetHack]] also adds the vampire as a starting race, and randomly generated vampires are also often generated with opera cloaks. The same conditions for player and polyself vampires apply as in SLASH'EM, as do the conditions for vampires generating with potions of blood or vampire blood.

Vampire blood quaffed by non-vampire players will polymorph them depending on beatitude - an uncursed potion will turn them into a vampire, as with SLASH'EM. The same conditions and penalties apply.

===dNetHack===
{{main|Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)}}
In [[dNetHack]], vampires are also a starting race. Pet vampires will drain corpses for nutrition the same way a player vampire does, with similar conditions (i.e. corpses must be less than 3 turns of age and have blood).

Vampires may appear in the court of a vampire lord-ruled [[Throne room#dNetHack|throne room]].

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship
arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as
friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my
friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come
in mist which he create--that noble ship's captain proved him
of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this
mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on
moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we
ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a
hairbreadth space at the tomb door.
[ Dracula, by Bram Stoker ]

The Oxford English Dictionary is quite unequivocal:
_vampire_ - "a preternatural being of a malignant nature (in
the original and usual form of the belief, a reanimated
corpse), supposed to seek nourishment, or do harm, by sucking
the blood of sleeping persons. ..."

A '''vampire lord''', {{monsym|vampire lord}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Like the weaker [[vampire]], they are human [[undead]] that are [[breathless]] and possess [[flight]], [[regeneration]] and a stronger [[drain life (monster attack)|life-draining]] bite attack; they also possess [[sleep resistance]] and [[poison resistance]], and will [[follow]] you to other levels if they are adjacent.

Vampire lords are [[shapeshifter]]s and can [[polymorph]] at will into [[vampire bat]]s, [[wolves]] or [[fog cloud]]s - they often disguise themselves as the former two when outside of the player's sight, shift into the latter to flow under locked or inaccessible [[door]]s, and revert to vampire form if killed in any of these forms. Standing on any [[altar]] [[scare]]s vampires, similar to standing on [[Elbereth]] or a [[scroll of scare monster]].{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|154|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

[[Player]]s in the form of a vampire lord are [[Warned of monster type|warned of]] any {{monclasslink|@}}, and will turn into [[vampire bat]]s if they polymorph without [[polymorph control]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The monster is renamed to the '''vampire leader''', with "lord" being a male title and "lady" being a female title.}}

==Generation==
In addition to random generation, vampires lord are a rare occurrence in [[graveyard]]s. All normally-generated vampire lords are hostile. Vampires can [[grow up]] into vampire lords.

At least four vampire lords are generated in [[Orcus-town]] on level creation. A vampire lord is always generated next to the [[Wizard of Yendor]] inside [[Wizard's Tower|his tower]], and one is generated within each of the [[Fake Wizard's Tower]]s. The Wizard may also create a clone disguised as a vampire lord via his [[Double Trouble]] spell.

A vampire lord that is killed may leave behind a tainted [[Human (monster)|human]] [[corpse]].

==Strategy==
Vampire lords are even more troublesome than normal vampires due to their higher damage, speed, [[AC]] and [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR score]] - without [[drain resistance]], you may find yourself drained of a few [[experience level]]s while fighting them unless you're especially careful or have [[MC]]3. Like vampires, vampire lords can wear all armor, but are much more likely to be encountered in animal or fog cloud form.

Vampire lords will revive in vampire form after you dispatch their weaker guises - they may also shapeshift to humanoid form, which retains their current HP and makes them easier to kill. A silver weapon with good enchantment and/or skill level can kill them fairly quickly regardless of form.

===As pets===
If you are wearing a [[ring of protection from shape changers]], vampire lords make excellent pets - without the ring, they will normally shapeshift once out of your sight, and are weak fighters in their other forms, unable to wear armor and breaking out of any body armor they were wearing if they shapeshift into a wolf. A tame vampire lord will not shapeshift back to humanoid form unless killed or forced back to normal by the ring; players planning to keep one as a pet should identify the ring as soon as possible.

The vampire lord's base AC of 0 and access to all armor gives them higher potential for survivability compared to a normal vampire, though their silver weakness and lack of elemental resistances can still prove problematic. Additionally, their 50 MR makes them harder to tame - a regular vampire has only 25 MR, and on generally only needs two levels to become a vampire lord.

===As a polyform===
Vampires lords are a stellar polyself form for players - they are [[strong]] with a base AC of 0 and 14 base speed, and can wear all armor and wield any non-silver weapons. Like other vampires, they do not need to eat, and the regeneration, flight and breathlessness are great properties to have as intrinsics. Also like other vampires, the form's primary weaknesses are silver and monsters with lethal passives such as [[cockatrices]] that will occur if you attack them in melee.

==History==
The vampire lord first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]]. Their shapeshifting abilities were added in [[NetHack 3.6.0]]; this makes them somewhat better pets in previous versions and some variants based on them, as they will not shapeshift out of any armor you give them.

==Messages==
{{main|Vampire (monster class)#Messages}}
[[Chat]]ting to vampire lords in their humanoid form will produce various responses from them depending on the time of day, the monster's peacefulness and your current form.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], pet vampire lords can drain blood from living victims or corpses, or else drink a [[potion of blood]] or vampire blood, for nutrition like their undead kin and player vampires; drained corpses are still eligible to sacrifice if they are not too old. Vampire lords in the dungeon generate with a [[potion of blood]] or vampire blood, and will drink non-cursed vampire blood to restore 2-10 HP - they gain nothing from drinking cursed potions.

Vampire lords [[Need +x weapon to hit|need a +3 weapon to be hit]], and [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|hits monsters as +3 weapons]] themselves. Like other vampires, they are often generated with [[opera cloak]]s, and can provide a valuable method of farming said cloaks, especially if it is the [[randomized appearance]] of a [[cloak of magic resistance]] - the tradeoff lies in these vampires being even harder to dispatch, depending on the cloak.

===UnNetHack===
{{main|Vampire (starting race in UnNetHack)}}
As with SLASH'EM, randomly generated vampire lords in [[UnNetHack]] are also generated with opera cloaks often. The same conditions for polyself vampire lords apply as in SLASH'EM, as do the conditions for vampire lords generating with potions of blood or vampire blood.

Vampire blood quaffed by non-vampire players will polymorph them depending on beatitude - a blessed potion will turn them into a vampire lord. This incurs a −3 alignment penalty if neutral, while you take a −15 alignment penalty and [[anger]] your [[god]] if lawful or a [[Monk]]. The polymorph is "semi-permanent" and will last until your HP is reduced to 0.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], pet vampire lords will drain corpses for nutrition the same way a player vampire does, with similar conditions (i.e. corpses must be less than 3 turns of age and have blood).

A vampire lord may appear as the ruler of a randomly-generated [[Throne room#dNetHack|throne room]].

'''Vlad the Impaler''', {{monsym|vlad_the_impaler}}, is a unique [[vampire]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. He guards the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]]. Like his weaker [[vampire]] brethren, he possesses the abilities of [[flight]], [[magical breathing]], and [[drain life (monster attack)|life-draining]] bites. He is also [[covetous]], and will warp to the upstairs (or the ladder down in his tower) to heal.

==Generation==
Vlad the Impaler resides at the top of [[Vlad's Tower|his tower]] in [[Gehennom]]. Along with the Candelabrum, Vlad has a 79% chance of [[monster starting inventory|generating with]] any one of the following weapon sets: a [[two-handed sword]], a [[battle-axe]], or a [[bow]] and 3-14 [[arrow]]s.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|518|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Vlad is the second [[fast]]est monster in the game at 26 speed, far faster than a player with [[speed boots]]. He hits hard and often, and is capable of sneaking in several warp-and-bites and retreating to the stairs/ladder before you get a chance to retaliate. Unlike other covetous monsters, if you are standing on the ladder yourself, he will warp away a few steps when hurt instead of staying next to the ladder - if you take the bait and follow, he may then reach the ladder and escape down. Above all else, he deals double damage during the midnight hour (0:00-0:59 server time) due to being undead, and he is also immune to [[sleep]], [[wand of death|death rays]], [[wand of slow monster|slowness]], and [[polymorph]].

Combined with his high 130 base HP, Vlad can be quite frustrating to fight, especially for low-damage characters. The quickest way to deal with him is to use a [[footrice]] corpse or a [[potion of paralysis]]. If neither is available, you will need solid AC and a well-enchanted [[silver]] weapon to take him down quickly. Failing that, you can let him escape the tower into the main area of Gehennom, and stand on an upstair to fight him.

Be careful not to [[confuse]] Vlad: if he then [[levelport]]s by reading a [[scroll of teleportation]], you get to look for him in his Tower, all of [[Gehennom]] above it, and the entire [[Dungeons of Doom]], which is very annoying. This also makes [[Magicbane]] an impractical choice.

==History==
Vlad the Impaler first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]]. From this version to [[NetHack 3.6.1]], Vlad used to be significantly slower, weaker and wouldn't teleport away. He was widely regarded as being quite a feeble enemy for the stage of the game when he is faced - he was not significantly stronger than the [[vampire lord]]s which appear as normal enemies.

Particularly during the era of [[NetHack 3.4.3]], jokes abounded of fighting him with [[food ration]]s, [[magic marker]]s, [[rust|thoroughly rusty]] [[corrosion|thoroughly corroded]] [[tin opener]]s or [[orcish dagger]]s, not moving every second turn while fighting him, or a variety of other absurd scenarios which would normally result in [[YASD]], and still easily defeating Vlad. The items used for such exploits had become known as '''Vladsbanes''', '''Vladbanes''' or '''Vladsmashers''' (in a mockery of [[the Banes]]) - these items were often #[[name]]d so in tribute, as seen in the link below. The danger of Vlad reading a scroll of teleportation while confused even gave you a legitimate reason to use a Vladbane-type weapon instead of Magicbane. A variety of [[patch]]es were written before 3.6.1 to address this issue by altering Vlad in some way. One of the better known ones was the aptly-named Vlad Balance patch.

==Dudley's dungeon==
The [[Dudley's dungeon]] strip for [https://web.archive.org/web/20161006152020/http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20061130 30 November 2006] (via Wayback Machine) featured several humorous attempts to remake Vlad; see also the comments for the 30 November and 1 December strips.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}
Vlad is a major vampire based mostly on the fictional [[Wikipedia:Count Dracula|Count Dracula]], who is in turn based on the non-fictional Vlad [[wikipedia:Drăculea|Drăculea]], a 15th century Romanian prince.

==Variants==
Several variants that feature Vlad either adjust his placement in the dungeon, or else employ their own methods to make him significantly stronger and more challenging.

===SporkHack===

In [[SporkHack]] he's been beefed up significantly, most notably by arming him with an artifact [[two-handed sword]] named [[Lifestealer]] that has similar properties to [[Stormbringer]].

===GruntHack===

[[GruntHack]] enhances Vlad's vital statistics (base level 28, base speed 24, [[stun]]ning and [[confusion]] attacks) and give him a guaranteed [[Object properties|thirsty]] [[spetum]] and a stack of [[BUC#Cursed|cursed]] [[scroll of teleportation|scrolls of teleportation]].

===SLASH'EM===
