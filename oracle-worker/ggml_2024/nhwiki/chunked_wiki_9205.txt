This file was originally automatically generated.

DIF is the monster's difficulty value. Monsters will start being eligible
for random generation when the average of your experience level and your
dungeon level is equal to DIF; they will be considered too weak for
generation when your dungeon level is 7*DIF or greater. (For this purpose,
once you have the Amulet of Yendor your dungeon level is considered to be
that of the Sanctum, and in the endgame to be the depth of the Sanctum
plus half your experience level.) The level of your god's appreciation of
a sacrificed corpse is also dependent on the corpse's DIF.

FREQ is the relative frequency of monster generation. An X in this field
means the monster will not be randomly generated, and only appears in
certain circumstances or on predefined levels. A monster with 0 frequency
will only be randomly generated in a dungeon branch or on a dungeon level
biased towards a specific alignment (not necessarily its own). '*' denotes
monsters that will not be randomly generated in Gehennom; '#' monsters that
will not be randomly generated outside it.

The GRP field indicates if monsters are generated in large groups (2 to 11
monsters at a time) or small groups (2 to 4 monsters at a time). These
groups will be smaller if you are at a low (less than 5) experience level.
Large-group monsters have a 1/3 chance of being generated in a small group
instead; small-group monsters a 1/2 chance of being generated as
singletons.

ALN is the strength of alignment of the monster: positive numbers denote
lawful monsters, negative chaotic, zero neutral. The Wizard of Yendor is
non-aligned. Certain special levels and certain dungeon branches are biased
towards creation of monsters of a specific alignment (see the NetHack
Gazetteer for details); furthermore, lawful monsters will not be randomly
generated in Gehennom.

The SIZE field shows the physical size of the monster. Though establishing
a realistic scale for NetHack isn't something that can be easily done, the
following guidelines are given (metric conversion approximate):
  SIZE  :   tiny      small     medium   large     huge       gigantic
  Scale :   < 2'      2'-4'     4'-7'    7'-12'   12'-25'   "off the scale"
        : (< 0.5m)  (0.5m-1m)  (1m-2m)  (2m-4m)   (4m-8m)

WGT specifies the weight of the monster or its corpse (100 zorkmids weigh
1). Statues of that monster weigh (1.5 * WGT). NUTR specifies the
nutrition value of a corpse when eaten (a monster swallowed whole gives
half its nutrition). GEN indicates if a monster is able to be genocided.

CORPSE% gives the percentage chance of a monster leaving a corpse when
killed (assuming the circumstances are such that it can leave a corpse at
all; not disintegrated, digested, drowned, stoned...). No corpses will be
left by monsters dying on the Rogue level. '#' indicates that the corpse
left will be of a different monster (the human form of lycanthropes, the
basic race for undead). Monsters marked with a '*' are less likely to
leave corpses on levels with graveyards (for this purpose, the Castle and
all levels of the Priest Quest are considered graveyard levels, as is any
level on which undead have been summoned by the cursed Book of the Dead or
Bell of Opening): 1/9 the chance if killed by you, 1/3 otherwise (eg, by a
trap or another monster).

Calculation of player's score in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>


4*XP points for each monster killed.
10 points for each wand identified by engraving or zapping.
10 points for each potion identified by quaffing.
10 points for each scroll identified by reading.
9 points for each squeaky board oiled/greased.
4 points for each tripe ration eaten when not a carnivorous non-humanoid.
4 points for "Yuk, this water tastes awful" from quaffing from a sink.

The first oracle of each type:

Minor (if not yet major): 21 points.
Minor (if already major): 9 points.
Major (if not yet minor): 210 + (21 * XL) points.
Major (if already minor): 90 + (9 * XL) points.

Then at the end of the game:

1 point for each zorkmid more than starting gold ( * 90% if game 
         ended in death).
50 * (DL-1) points where DL is the deepest level reached.
1000 points for each dungeon level reached beyond 20, to a maximum of
         10000 points.

The score so far is doubled if you ascended. Then, if you escaped the
dungeon or ascended, you receive points for items in inventory:

Value of amulets and valuable gems (see amul-343.txt and gems-343.txt)
Value of artifacts (2.5 * cost of artifact - see art1-343.txt),
including invocation items.

and finally points for adjacent pets equivalent to their total current
hit points.

Effects of kicking and quaffing from sinks in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

Quaffing from sinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
11/20: No effect. One of the following messages:
        "You take a sip of (very) <hot|warm|cold> water."
        "You hear clanking from the pipes..."
        "You hear snatches of song from among the sewers..."
        "From the murky drain, a hand reaches up... --oops--" (only if
          hallucinating)

1/20: If you are fire resistant, no effect; otherwise, you lose d6 hit
      points.
        "You take a sip of scalding hot water."
        "It seems quite tasty." (fire resistant)

1/20: A sewer rat is generated (unless genocided or extinct).
        "Eek!  There's a sewer rat in the sink!" (unblind)
        "Eek!  There's something squirmy in the sink!" (blind)
        "The sink seems quite dirty." (genocided or extinct)

1/20: You suffer the effect of quaffing a random uncursed potion (other
      than water).
        "Some <potion appearance> liquid flows from the faucet." (unblind)
        "Some odd liquid flows from the faucet." (blind)

1/20: If you have already acquired a ring from this sink (by quaffing or
      kicking), no effect; otherwise, a random ring is created and your
      wisdom exercised.
        "You find a ring in the sink!"
        "Some dirty water backs up in the drain." (already got one)

1/20: The sink becomes a fountain.
        "The pipes break!  Water spurts out!"

1/20: A water elemental is created (unless extinct).
        "The water moves as though of its own will!"
        "But it quiets down." (extinct)

1/20: You gain one experience point.
        "Yuk, this water tastes awful."

1/20: You vomit and your hunger is increased.
        "Gagg... this tastes like sewage!  You vomit."

1/20: If you have unchanging, no effect; otherwise, you polymorph.
        "This water contains toxic wastes!"
        "You undergo a freakish metamorphosis!" (polymorph)


Kicking sinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4/5: Your dexterity is exercised.
       "Klunk!  The pipes vibrate noisily."

1/5: Something else, as follows:

  If you haven't yet got a black pudding from the sink, 1/3 chance of
  one being generated and your dexterity being exercised.
    "A <black> ooze gushes up from the drain!" (unblind)
    "You hear a gushing sound." (blind)

  If you didn't get a pudding and haven't yet had a dish washer, 1/3
  chance of one being summoned (an incubus if a female humanoid,
  a succubus if a male humanoid, otherwise an equal chance of either),
  and your dexterity being exercised.
    "The dish washer returns!" (unblind)
    "Something returns!" (blind), and

  If you didn't get either of the above, 1/3 chance of a random ring
  being created provided the sink hasn't yet given one through kicking or
  quaffing, and your wisdom and dexterity being exercised.
    "Flupp!  Muddy waste pops up from the drain." (unblind)
    "Flupp!  You hear a sloshing sound." (blind)
    "You see a ring shining in its midst." (unblind, ring created)

  If you didn't get any of the above, you get a hurt foot. Your dexterity
  and strength are abused, there is a 1/3 chance of your right leg being
  hurt for 5 to 10 turns, and you lose d5 HP (d3 HP if your constitution
  is greater than 15).
    "Ouch! That hurts!"


Other sink effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sinks, as the name suggests, will cause anything in the air above them
to fall to the floor: thrown weapons, or you when levitating (inflicting
d8 + 24 - CON damage, plus d3 for each weapon or stack of weapons on the
square). Dropping rings onto a sink will usually cause them to be lost
down it, with a message that may enable you to identify the ring; see
ring-343.txt for a list of these effects. Digging down on a sink square
will convert it into a fountain as in the quaffing result above ("The
pipes break!  Water spurts out!").

'''Artifacts''' in [[dNetHack]] can be divided into two broad categories: wishable and non-wishable.  Wishable artifacts include those artifacts that can be given as divine gifts, including the vanilla crowning gifts but excluding new crowning gifts. Non-wishable artifacts include any [[Category:DNethack_Quests|quest artifacts]], as well as any first gifts for race-specific role/race combinations (dwarf noble, drow shared, etc.). Artifacts belonging to late-game enemies like demon or devil lords are unwishable, as are any found on alignment quests. 

Randomly found artifacts do not affect the odds of gifted or wished artifacts later. For the rules for wishing for artifacts, see [[dNetHack artifact wishing]]. (Spoilers!)

This page is currently being revised due to many updates changing artifact effects. Everything including and above the listed artifact has been revised and is accurate to the current version: Xiuhcoatl

<math>L</math> is luck, if X>15, or luck/3, if X<=15

<math>J = \frac{49-luck}{50-luck}</math>

<math>EV(X,L) = \left[\frac{X+1}{2} + J \cdot L \cdot (1 - \frac{L+1}{2 \cdot X})\right] \left[ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1 + J \cdot L}{X}} \right] </math>
