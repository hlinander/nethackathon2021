==Использование==
Замешательство в [[conflict|бою]] в основном используют начинающие персонажи.

Замешательство может быть полезно в некоторых ситуациях - сбитые с толку монстры не могут правильно накладывать [[monster spells|заклинания]] и получат неожиданный результат при чтении [[scrolls|свитков]]. Они также могут атаковать других монстров и хаотично двигаться, поэтому они не смогут долго атаковать вас будучи в замешательстве. Хотя сбитые с толку монстру все еще непредсказуемые и начнут использовать дальний бой. Поскольку атака зависит от вражеского сопротивления магии, то при продвижении по подземелью атаки с замешательством будут становиться все менее эффективными (хотя эффективность способности повышается с вашим уровнем, в отличии от атаки из [[wand|волшебной палочки]] или [[scroll|свитка]]).

Проклятый свиток замешательства, или если вы превратили любой свиток замешательства, может быть использован для сбивания с толку самого себя для получения полезного эффекта от [[Confusion#Confused_scroll_effects|чтения свитка замешательства]], если [[potion of booze|алкоголь]], [[potion of confusion|зелье замешательства]] или заклинание высокого уровня не доступны. Благословленный свиток замешательства удаляет эффект, хотя [[unicorn horn|рог единорога]] дает тот же эффект без траты свитка, хотя, использование свитка и дает 100% эффект, а даже благословленный рог может дать сбой. В общем и целом, свиток полезен на начальных уровнях, но в дальнейшем он хороший кандидат на [[blanking|очистку]].

&&%s&& %s Backstab {147510 2022-08-14T14:27:30Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* dNetHack */ In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''backstab''' refers to the extra damage done by [[Rogue]]s on fleeing monsters; attacks doing backstab damage are sometimes called '''sneak attacks'''. It is calculated as 1d''xplevel''.{{refsrc|uhitm.c|652|nethack=3.6.0}} Only melee attacks count toward backstab damage.

==Strategy==
A basic means of utilizing backstabs is to inscribe Elbereth with a monster next to you, then step off to attack the monster as it turns to flee. This can be repeated ad infinitum, with the only limitation being your patience, but is probably not worth your time against monsters that you can kill easily. Musical instruments, mirrors, and all the other [[Scare#Methods|methods of scaring]] can be used to set up easy backstabs.

Backstab is one of the few damage bonuses that are affected by [[double damage]], so it can be very powerful with an appropriate [[artifact weapon]].  While it's impossible to backstab while [[twoweapon]]ing, with high enough [[Dexterity]] switching between one and two weapons is a free action.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and variants based on it, any weapon's damage against a fleeing monster while not wielding two weapons would qualify for the backstab bonus, including thrown objects such as daggers. This was changed in [[3.6.0]], with the combined bonuses of multiple flying daggers being seen as too powerful.{{refsrc|uhitm.c|648|nethack=3.6.0}}

==Variants==
===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], in addition to Rogues, backstab dice are available to Drow [[Anachrononaut]]s, [[Convict]]s wielding a [[spoon#dNetHack|spoon]], any character with [[Spirits (dNetHack)#Andromalius, the Repentant Rogue|Andromalius]] bound, and [[lightsaber]]-wielders using the Juyo form. Backstab dice apply when the target is fleeing, trapped, unmoving, sleeping, [[Stun#Monster stunning|stunned]], [[confusion#Monster confusion|confused]], or [[blind]]ed. With the [[DNetHack artifacts#The Lifehunt Scythe|Lifehunt Scythe]], players can also backstab if the monster doesn't know their location.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], backstab damage is limited by weapon skill; it can't go above d2/d4/d10/d20/d30 for Restricted/Unskilled/Basic/Skilled/Expert. Backstab damage applies when the monster is fleeing, trapped, frozen, unmoving, sleeping, stunned, confused, or blinded.

Blackbeard's Ghost is located at the center of the map, on a pile of loot containing the Treasury of Proteus, many piles of gold and gems, five scimitars, six random weapons, six random tools, and five chests. In addition to the passages shown on the map above, there is a network of random passages winding through the rock. The caldera is guarded by 15 [[human zombie]]s, two random [[zombie]]s, eight [[wraith]]s, one random wraithlike monster, 3 damned pirates, and nine skeletal pirates.

==Messages==
===Transporter level===
On descending to the level where the transporter is located:
 Ye receive a faint telepathic message from Mayor Cummerbund:
 Yer help be urgently needed at Tortuga!  Look for a ...ic transporter.
 Ye couldn't quite make out that last message.

===Entry===
First time:
 Ye breathe deeply of the sweet bouquet that is Tortuga. 
 ...It'll linger.
 Rather than the chaotic din ye recall, a eerie silence greets yer 
 lugs. In the distance, ye hear soldiers on patrol. Seems yer pirate
 brethren be in need of yer assistance!
Next time:
 Once again, you breathe the bouquet that is Tortuga.
If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Ye are back on Tortuga
 Ye fear that soon the brethren of the coast will have to abandon 
 Tortuga.

===Quest guardians===
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "The soldiers o' Yendor attacked Tortuga and destroyed Mayor Cummerbund's home!"
 "These Yendorans 'ave disturbed the dead that lay in Davy Jones's
 Locker!"
 "Ol' Mayor Cummerbund once sailed with the Dread Pirate Roberts, or so they say."
 "Blackbeard's Ghost has risen and scattered the soldiers sent to Shipwreck Island.
 Now the dead attack Tortuga as well!"
 "Captain Ketch led the attack and sank many o' our ships. Now Ketch be
 trapped on Shipwreck Island." 
If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Have ye found much booty in the Dungeons o' Doom?"
 "Did ye send Ketch to feed the fishes?"
 "Arrrr!"
 "Ol' Mayor Cummerbund once sailed with the Dread Pirate Roberts, or so they say."
 "Be there comely lasses in the Dungeons o' Doom?"

===Quest leader===
When you first meet your quest leader:
 "So, <playername>. Ye have returned to yer brethren. We 'ave need of a canny 
 <daughter/son> of the coast to show these Yendorans to the plank.
 "Let me be see'n if you BE that <daughter/son>."
When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Ye try me patience, <playername>.
 I hope that this time ye be ready."
This message is not currently used:
 "I hope for yer sake ye are prepared at last."
When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test seven times:
 "Me mercy is at an end, <playername>. Leave Tortuga and never return."
When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Ye be still too weak.  Return a proven Second Mate. Perhaps then
 ye will be ready.
 "Go now, and follow <deity> to glory and riches."
When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "Ye must follow <deity> through <alignment> waters to reach Shipwreck Island.
 "As ye be now ye would never make it. Do not return to Tortuga
 until ye be wise in the ways o' <deity>."
When finally assigned the quest:
 "I always knew ye had greatness in ye, <daughter/son>. As a pirate brother, perhaps ye may
 succeed where I once failed.
 "In my youth, I sailed with the immortal Dread Pirate, Roberts. In our
 adventures, we came to oppose Blackbeard, then mightiest of the servants 
 of the Devil, in his quest for the Treasury of Proteus.
 "Our final duel took place at the center of Shipwreck Island. Roberts, 
 himself a mighty follower of <deity>, bested Blackbeard 
 at swordplay, sending him tumbling into the caldera. But Blackbeard 
 was able to place a mighty curse on the Treasury of Proteus, and I was 
 unable to stop it plunging into the caldera to join him.
 "Now these Yendorans have come to claim what I lost, and in my age
 I be unable to stop them. So it falls to ye, my <daughter/son>. Drive these
 soldiers from Tortuga, then sail to Shipwreck Island, destroy Blackbeard's Ghost 
 once and fer all, and claim the Treasury of Proteus, in yer own name!"

====Encouragement====
If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "Do not be shaken by the fearsome form of Blackbeard's Ghost."
 "To enter Shipwreck Island you must find a hidden fissure in the rocks."
 "Oh, an' Captain Ketch owes me for a new house!"
 "Captain Ketch sailed to Shipwreck Island, but the ship was lost on the
 rocks an' Ketch doesn't know the way into the caves."
 "If ye do not destroy Blackbeard's Ghost, he will follow you back here!"
 "Sharks swim in the waters around Shipwreck Island."
 "It be pitch black in Shipwreck Island!"
 "There be much treasure lost in the waves around Shipwreck Island."
 "Only the <alignment> can reach Shipwreck Island."
 "Trust <deity> in yer hour of need."

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 Ye have reached the treacherous waters around Shipwreck Island at last
 The ghostly minions of Blackbeard's Ghost are everywhere around you.
When returning:
 Ye know that this time you must find and destroy Blackbeard's Ghost.
When first entering the goal level:
 Ye sense the presence of the Treasury of Proteus at the heart of Shipwreck Island.
When returning:
 Ye know that soon ye shall claim the Treasury of Proteus for yer own.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So, <playername>, Mayor Cummerbund thinks that ye can claim the Treasury of Proteus,
 when even he could not?!
 "He must be senile to send a <rankname> to destroy me, when even in his prime
 he failed at the same task! No, it is your soul that shall go to <deity>."
Upon further meetings:
 "I have been toying with ye, <playername>. This time I will kill ye."
And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "Flee now, <playername>. A Pirate cannot destroy Blackbeard's Ghost.
 "If ye do not flee, I will inflict so much suffering on ye that
 Mayor Cummerbund will feel guilty for ever having sent his <daughter/son> to me!"
When you have the Treasury of Proteus, but Blackbeard's Ghost has not been destroyed:
 "Return the Treasury of Proteus to me, or I shall visit torments on ye even
 Judas knows naught of.

====Discouragement====
Blackbeard's Ghost will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "I defeated death, even Mayor Cummerbund couldn't destroy me at his best.
 What hope have ye, <playername>."
 "I am the mightiest follower of the Devil the world 
 has ever known! Your weak devotion to <deity>
 will not save ye."
 "Beg for mercy now, and I will only kill ye."
 "Abandon your <alignment> ways! Slink off and never face me again!"
 "Vengeance will be mine, <playername>. I will make Mayor Cummerbund pay,
 for what he did to me!"
 "The Brethren of the Coast are finished. Now I rule the seas!"
 "With the Treasury of Proteus I control all the treasures of the sea!"
 "I will never die!"
 "Are ye truly the greatest pirate Tortuga has left?
 It will share your fate!"
 "Die in vain, <playername>! I will send Mayor Cummerbund to join ye!"

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 As ye pick up the Treasury of Proteus, ye feel a great
 weight has been lifted from your shoulders.  Your only thoughts are
 to quickly return to Tortuga and find Mayor Cummerbund.
When destroying the nemesis:
 A great crack opens below Blackbeard's Ghost, and a huge, flaming hand 
 reaches out to seize his wispy form. He curses ye:
  NO! I won't die here, <playername>! It is ye who's [sic] soul will feed 
  the Devil! I am king of all the oceans, I cannot be killed!
  I will haunt ye until <deity> betrays ye!
When returning to your quest leader:
 As Mayor Cummerbund senses the Treasury of Proteus, the lines on his face harden
 into what may be his version of a smile.
  Ye have claimed the Treasury of Proteus.  Ye hold in
  yer hands all the treasures of the sea.  Ye may well be
  the next Dread Pirate, greater even than Roberts. My 
  <daughter/son>, ye should seek a treasure greater than any pirate
  has ever sought before: the Amulet of Yendor.
  The great Wizard, who lives in Yendor, knows that ye 
  can claim this prize. It was he who sent the soldiers here.
  Return to the Dungeons of Doom, and claim yer destiny!
When subsequently throwing the Treasury of Proteus to Mayor Cummerbund:
 "The Treasury of Proteus is yers.  Yer destiny awaits through the portal that 
 brought ye here."

===Post-Quest===
When talking to Mayor Cummerbund after the quest:
 "Tell me of yer adventures in yer quest for the Amulet of Yendor."
When talking to Mayor Cummerbund after getting the [[the Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Ye have claimed the Amulet of Yendor! Truly ye were destined to be
 the greatest <daughter/son> of the Breathren of the Coast!
 "Now ye must travel to the astral sea, and offer the Amulet on the
 High Altar of <deity>!"

==Usage in variants==

The Pirate quest also appears in [[SlashTHEM]], which has incorporated the Pirate patch. In this variant, all the watery quest levels have some [[giant eel]]s and [[kraken]] in addition to the other pre-placed monsters.

&&%s&& %s Source talk:NetHack 3.4.3/src/artifact.c {87582 2013-11-11T22:53:27Z {4000266 Bejonas}  == On the implementation ==

The artifact weapon handling code is one of the most tangled pieces of code.  Here are some findings.

The bonuses of artifacts are defined partly by artilist [[Artilist.h]].  This is an array of struct artifact structures.  This structure has a struct attack attk field whose members are used in a way completely unlike how struct attack is used for monster descriptions.  In this struct attack, the adtyp field tells both what type of elemental damage the bonus damage deals, and how a monster can resist the bonus damage; the damn field gives the to-hit bonus, and the damd field gives the damage bonus.

The to-hit bonus applies against any monsters, and is 1dX where X is the previously mentioned damn field.

The damage bonus applies only to particular monsters, and either adds 1dY extra damage where Y is the damd field, or doubles the normal damage that would be dealt by the weapon (if the damd field is zero).  This is handled in artifact.c:artifact_hit.  There's special handling for artifacts that drain life or behead or bisect.

Magicbane gets extra special bonuses in addition to the normal damage bonus code path.  This handles both the effects and the extra damage for the scare, confuse, stun, cancel, probe bonuses.

One crazy part of this code is the action at a distance with the spec_dbon_applies static boolean variable of artifact.c.  This variable tells whether the current weapon hit with an artifact can apply the special attack to the monster it's hit.  The value of this variable is computed by artifact.c:spec_dbon, and is checked in artifact.c:artifact_hit which calls spec_dbon before.  In case of Magicbane, spec_dbon_applies gets decided from a monmr roll, but this monmr roll doesn't go through the zap.c:resist function and doesn't add the level difference bonus unlike most monmr checks.  (If the player is attacked, there is no monmr check, you resist if you have MR.)  If spec_dbon_applies, Magicbane deals an extra 1d4 damage, and the special attacks are somewhat more likely.  The cancel and scare effects have an extra monmr check (MR check for the player), which can negate the cancel or scare effect but not the associated damage.  This latter monmr check is a normal one going through zap.c:resist, and so gets the level bonuses from the defender's level and constant 10 (normal for weapons) used as the attacker's level.

Another crazy part is well known because of the comment in weapon.c:dmgval:
            /* if the weapon is going to get a double damage bonus, adjust
               this bonus so that effectively it's added after the doubling */
            if (bonus > 1 && otmp->oartifact && spec_dbon(otmp, mon, 25) >= 25)
                bonus = (bonus + 1) / 2;}
&&%s&& %s Comments {131779 2020-02-02T20:16:19Z {4000978 Aximili} Add category The NetHack [[source code]] has some illuminating and embarrassing '''comments'''.  Here is a selection, just to get you the feeling.

== Illuminating ==

From [[pray.c]] for the function god_zaps_you, about what happens if your god decides to destroy you with a wide-angle disintegration beam but you are disintegration resistant.

 /* "I am sometimes shocked by...  the nuns who never take a bath without
 * wearing a bathrobe all the time.  When asked why, since no man can see them,
 * they reply 'Oh, but you forget the good God'.  Apparently they conceive of
 * the Deity as a Peeping Tom, whose omnipotence enables Him to see through
 * bathroom walls, but who is foiled by bathrobes." --Bertrand Russell, 1943
 * Divine wrath, dungeon walls, and armor follow the same principle.
 */

From the beginning of [[spell.c]] explaining how spellcasting penalties work.  It's worthwhile to check out the [[spell.c#line37|full comment]] there.

  *	Tou are aware of magic from all the great films they have seen

From [[trap.c]] in the mintrap function, on what happens if a monster falls into a trap made by you, or triggers a bear trap or land mine set by you.

 	    /* Monster is aggravated by being trapped by you.
 	       Recognizing who made the trap isn't completely
 	       unreasonable; everybody has their own style. */

From the beginning of [[weapon.c]],

 /* Historical note: The original versions of Hack used a range of damage
 * which was similar to, but not identical to the damage used in Advanced
 * Dungeons and Dragons.  I figured that since it was so close, I may as well
 * make it exactly the same as AD&D, adding some more weapons in the process.
 * This has the advantage that it is at least possible that the player would
 * already know the damage of at least some of the weapons.  This was circa
 * 1987 and I used the table from Unearthed Arcana until I got tired of typing
 * them in (leading to something of an imbalance towards weapons early in
 * alphabetical order).  The data structure still doesn't include fields that
 * fully allow the appropriate damage to be described (there's no way to say
 * 3d6 or 1d6+1) so we add on the extra damage in dmgval() if the weapon
 * doesn't do an exact die of damage.
 *
 * Of course new weapons were added later in the development of Nethack.  No
 * AD&D consistency was kept, but most of these don't exist in AD&D anyway.
 *
 * Second edition AD&D came out a few years later; luckily it used the same
 * table.  As of this writing (1999), third edition is in progress but not
 * released.  Let's see if the weapon table stays the same.  --KAA
 * October 2000: It didn't.  Oh, well.
 */

== Funny ==

In [[objects.c]] 

 /* "If tin whistles are made out of tin, what do they make foghorns out of?" */

Announcing the highly confusing [[rnz]] function in [[rnd.c]]:

 /* rnz: everyone's favorite! */

== Embarrassing ==

In [[spell.c]] function spelleffects, where it creates a stack of 20 spellbooks as a pseudo-objects that it passes to functions that normally expect a scroll or potion.
 	pseudo->quan = 20L;			/* do not let useup get it */

In [[weapon.c]] function dmgval, when computing bonuses for blessed or silver weapons
 	    /* if the weapon is going to get a double damage bonus, adjust
 	       this bonus so that effectively it's added after the doubling */
 	    if (bonus > 1 && otmp->oartifact && spec_dbon(otmp, mon, 25) >= 25)
 		bonus = (bonus + 1) / 2;

== Mysterious ==

From [[context.h]]:

        unsigned run;           /* 0: h (etc), 1: H (etc), 2: fh (etc) */
                                /* 3: FH, 4: ff+, 5: ff-, 6: FF+, 7: FF- */
                                /* 8: travel */

This comment apparently has not changed since the days of [[Hack]], apart from the addition of travel. By the time [[NetHack 3.4.3]] was released, many of the possible values for <tt>flags.run</tt> had an unclear purpose, and the comment really didn't help, at all.  FIQ believes some of the values may not have been used even in Hack itself, but in another game originally distributed with hack, apparently called Quest, which used some of the same source files, did not require others, and had some extra source files of its own; this game, if it ever existed in complete form, has since been lost.

The Grudge Patch is a [[patch]] by Nephi that introduces new pre-programmed hostilities between certain monsters.

The Grudge Patch is written as a patch against [[vanilla]] and can be found wherever Nethack patches are collected.

Modified versions of the Grudge Patch have been incorporated into certain variants.

== UnNetHack ==

[[UnNetHack]] includes a modified version of the Grudge patch.

The added hostilities in UnNetHack are as follows:
* [[Quest#Quest leaders and nemeses|Quest Leaders]] fight all monsters currently hostile to the player. Any monster currently hostile to the player will also be hostile to the Quest Leader.
* All [[elf|elves]] attack all [[orc]]s and [[kobold]]s on sight. All orcs and kobolds attack all elves on sight.
* All [[angel]]s attack all [[demon]]s on sight. All demons attack all angels on sight.
* All [[Nazgul]] attack all [[hobbit]]s on sight. All hobbits attack all Nazgul on sight.
* All [[Deep orc]]s attack all [[dwarf|dwarves]] on sight. All dwarves attack all Deep orcs on sight.
* [[Woodchuck]]s will attack the [[Oracle]] on sight. The reverse is not true, but the Oracle does have both a passive defense and special behavior regarding Woodchucks, both predating this patch.
* All [[raven]]s will attack all eye-shaped monsters (Floating eyes, evil eyes, beholders (beholders are currently deferred))
* [[Dungeon fern]]s are hostile to everything, and everything is hostile to dungeon ferns.

== FIQHack ==

[[FIQHack]] includes the following grudges:

* [[Quest Leaders]] fight all monsters hostile to the player and on adjacent tiles.  The reverse is also true.<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/865c9091803e844b66255e122877ae6c70950e51/libnethack/src/mon.c#L2270</ref>

Note that there is a distinction in the FIQHack code between 'grudges' (entities attack each other on sight) and 'adjacent grudges' (entities only attack each other if they are next to each other).

The object of the game is the same: to fetch the [[Amulet of Yendor]] from the bottom of [[Gehennom]] and offer it to your [[god]].

Compared to ''SLASH'EM'', the aim of ''Slash'EM Extended'' is to be a "kitchen sink" style variant that heavily raises the difficulty of the dungeon and adds several new roles and races for the player to choose from, alongside several new special levels and a near-endless amount of monsters; the developer is also known to deliberately implement content from generally-obscure and lesser known variants (e.g., a dungeon [[branch]] dedicated to [[ZAPM]]) as well as [[Evil Patch Idea]]s and [[Evil Variant]] [[Sokoban]] levels.

However, due to some of the new content being highly inappropriate, or in some cases illegal depending on location, most of the information regarding it has been removed &ndash; this page exists for historical purposes. The repository for Slash'EM Extended can be found on the GitHub website, but access to the repo comes with an 'objectionable content' warning banner, and an account is required to view the content. Some of the less-objectionable content has influenced features in other variants of ''NetHack'': particular examples include in-game monster lookup, which has since seen use in many variants, and the idea of various monster "templates" that can be applied to randomly generated monsters (which exists in SLEX as "egotypes").

[[SlashTHEM]] in particular was originally a direct successor variant of Slash'EM Extended v75, and eventually diverged significantly in favor of becoming a more SLASH'EM-based fork - it also retains and builds on many of the elements originating from early Slash'EM Extended and the other variants it drew from, including [[NetHack: The Next Generation]], [[SLASH 6]] and [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]]. Remnants of influences specific to Slash'EM Extended include the [[Acid Mage]] and [[Electric Mage]] roles; the SlashTHEM article has a full list of additions to the game and their sources, and a list of features from Slash'EM Extended deferred in SlashTHEM can be viewed on [[Deferred and defunct features (SlashTHEM)|this article]].

The '''Keter Sephiroth''' (singular ''Keter Sephirah'') are [[dNetHack]]'s replacements for the [[Keystone Kop]]s. The Keter are based on the Inevitables from 3rd edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

The naming system used for the Keter Sephiroth is based on the Kabbalah, but the symbolism of the Kabbalah otherwise has nothing to do with the Keter.

The kingship enumerations take over the main functionality of the [[Keystone Kop]]s in dNetHack; they are created in large numbers and attempt to block the character off from the stairs, trapping them on the current level. The Malkuth Sephiroth are significantly more dangerous than the Kops, however, as they are very fast (speed 24), can destroy wands with their electrical attacks, and grab the character, making it difficult to run away or engage in melee combat.

Malkuth Sephiroth are the backbone of the forces of the Keter. They are never created alone; instead, squads of Malkuth accompany one or two of the higher Keter on their missions.

Once the alarm sounds, three detachments of Malkuth Sephiroth appear on the current level, each led by a Yesod Sephirah. One detachment appears around the thief, one around the downstair, and one on the upstair.

Yesod Sephiroth do more damage than do Malkuth Sephiroth, but are slower and don't have any special effects on their attacks.

The fealty enumerations lead the detachments of Keter sent against characters that repeatedly violate their own internal laws (Knights that attack fleeing targets, Archeologists that dig up graves, etc). Some external laws will also anger the Hod Sephirah, including murder even as a chaotic, slaughtering coaligned unicorns, and murdering your quest leader. Each time a character violates such a law, an internal counter is incremented. The higher the counter, the greater the odds that a Hod Sephirah will be generated during normal monster generation. When a Hod Sephirah is generated, the counter is decremented, reducing the likelihood that additional Hod will be created.

Hod Sephiroth attack with a duplicate of your currently wielded weapon, or with their own innate attacks if they determine that your weapon is obviously substandard. Their mirrored facades grant them [[reflection]].

The severity enumerations lead the detachments of Keter sent against characters that repeatedly cheat death, whether with an [[amulet of life saving]] or by rehumanizing after receiving fatal damage in a polymorph form. 

Like the Hod Sephiroth, Gevurah Sephiroth are generated during normal monster generation, based on a counter keeping track of the number of times you have cheated death. Unlike the Hod Sephiroth, the counter is ''not'' decremented when a Gevurah Sephirah is created.

Gevurah Sephiroth attack with high-damage electrical and physical attacks. They can also pick up and throw boulders.

An angular, abstract scupture of unyielding iron and floating
hexagonal gears.  The narrow pyramid of its body tapers to a 
razor point, and its arms are swordblades about which dance 
arcs of black light.

The wisdom enumerations are sent against characters who repeatedly flout the laws of the Keter.

As with Hod and Gevurah Sephiroth, Chokhmah Sephiroth are controlled by a counter. This counter increments each time a Hod or Gevurah would be created, but is not actually created due to being too weak to face the character. The counter is never decremented.
