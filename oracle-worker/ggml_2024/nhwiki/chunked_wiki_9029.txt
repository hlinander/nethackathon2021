An '''Aleax'''{{ref|pluralization}}, {{monsym|aleax}}, is a [[humanoid]] [[angelic being]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is the only humanoid angelic monster that is a valid [[polymorph]] form.

==Generation==
Aleaxes are rarely generated randomly and will never appear in [[Gehennom]]. Randomly generated Aleaxes will be peaceful towards lawful characters with good [[alignment record]]. The Aleax may also appear as the [[minion]] of a lawful god.

They are [[Monster starting inventory|normally generated with]] an uncursed [[erodeproof]] [[large shield]] 75% of the time and a [[shield of reflection]] 25% of the time, and a blessed erodeproof [[long sword]], with a 5% chance of the sword being either [[Demonbane]] or [[Sunsword]] if the artifact has yet to be generated.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7|Demonbane is now a [[mace]], so Aleaxes can only receive Sunsword.}}

==Strategy==
Aleaxes are one of the few sources of [[reflection]] in the game. Since they are slow, they are usually not threatening to a player who is deep enough to encounter one, and even [[lawful]] characters who encounter peaceful Aleaxes may want to kill them for a chance at their shield.

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], the Aleax behaves similarly to how it does in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (as described [[#Origin|below]]), and will be generated with [[erodeproof]] +0 copies of all of the player's equipment and weapons worn at that time; artifacts will be converted to their [[base item]].

==Origin==
In ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', an Aleax is an avatar of a deity sent to punish a specific mortal; the Aleax takes on the target's exact appearance and carries identical equipment.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Said to be a doppelganger sent to inflict divine punishment for alignment violations.
}}

==Notes==
* {{note|pluralization}} In Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the proper pluralization of Aleax is '''Aleaxi'''<ref>David "Zeb" Cook (1994). Planescape Campaign Setting, Monstrous Supplement. Edited by David Wise. (TSR, Inc), pp. 2–3. ISBN 978-1560768340.</ref>. However, in NetHack 3.6.6 code "Aleaxi" is not in the list of irregular plurals{{refsrc|src/mondata.c|760|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}, and so NetHack pluralizes Aleax as Aleaxes. This article follow NetHack's convention.

The '''angel''', {{monsym|angel}}, is the most prominent of the [[angelic being]]s in ''[[NetHack]]''.

Angels possess a melee-range [[magic missile]] attack that they can use ignores both [[reflection]] and [[half spell damage]], but deals no damage if you have [[magic resistance]]. The magic missiles they fire at range are similar to those from a [[wand of magic missile]], but can be done at will. Like other monsters with magic missile attacks, angels have magic resistance.

== Generation ==
Angels that are randomly generated almost exclusively appear in the service of one of the [[deity|deities]], and appear in large numbers on the [[Astral Plane]]. You can also obtain a guardian angel as a [[minion]] when you arrive on the [[Astral Plane]] if your [[alignment]] is sufficiently high and you are not causing [[conflict]]; if you '''are''' generating conflict, a group of hostile angels will be generated instead.

If you are [[lawful]], randomly generated angels will be generated [[peaceful]]. {{frac|1|3}} of randomly appearing angels will be minions of a random god from your [[pantheon]]{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1355|nethack=3.6.6}}; usually they will be peaceful to [[co-aligned]] players, but some will be made "renegade", and peaceful to [[cross-aligned]] players instead.

Angels are [[Monster starting inventory|generated with]] an uncursed [[erodeproof]] [[large shield]] 75% of the time and a [[shield of reflection]] 25% of the time, and a blessed erodeproof [[long sword]], with a 5% chance of the sword being either [[Demonbane]] or [[Sunsword]] if the artifact has yet to be generated. The tame guardian angel you get when entering the Astral Plane gets slightly better gear: their weapon is blessed and its enchantment raised by 1-4 points (if it's under +4), and they will be given an [[amulet of reflection]] if they do not get a shield of reflection.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7|Demonbane is now a [[mace]], so Angels can only receive Sunsword.}}

==Strategy==
The [[wand of death]] is completely ineffective against angels, and they have a good chance of having a shield of reflection, which neuters other attack wands and spells. They are cold resistant, but still vulnerable to fire, so casting the [[spell of fireball]] at Skilled or Expert might do significant damage; however, you may have trouble mustering the necessary [[power]] to cast spells repeatedly in most situations involving angels, which will usually occur on the Astral Plane while you are carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]].

When fighting angels in melee, [[Fire Brand]] and [[Stormbringer]] are among the best weapon choices; however, on the Astral Plane, you will likely be seeking to find your [[high altar]], so a [[footrice]] corpse will be preferable in that scenario, as is a [[wand of teleportation]].

To avoid generating a group of hostile angels when you arrive on the Astral Plane, wait a few turns after you arrive before generating conflict.

==Variants==

=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]], Angels will attack any [[demon]]s they see, (and vice versa) as part of [[Nephi's grudge patch]].

=== SpliceHack ===
{{main|Angel_(starting_race)}}

[[SpliceHack]] adds angels as a starting race.

A '''ki-rin''', {{monsym|ki-rin}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are capable of [[see invisible|seeing invisible]], [[flight]], and [[spellcasting]], and are the second strongest [[angelic being]]s after [[Archon]]s.

==Generation==
Ki-rin are randomly generated very rarely, and will generate as [[peaceful]] for a lawful character with a good [[alignment record]]. They will not randomly generate in [[Gehennom]], with the exception of [[Vlad's Tower]]. Ki-rin may first show up within the [[Castle]], though they are often not seen until the [[ascension run]].

Ki-rin serve as [[minion]]s for lawful [[god]]s, who may send hostile ki-rin after you if you [[anger]] them (e.g. with excessive prayer) or rarely when you convert one of their [[altar]]s through [[sacrifice]]. Ki-rin are not eligible forms for [[polymorph]], and cannot be targeted for [[genocide]].

==Strategy==
Hostile ki-rin are quite dangerous to face - a repertoire of mage [[monster spells]], an [[AC]] of -5 and high [[magic resistance (monster)|monster magic resistance]] can render them a serious nuisance, especially if their level enough for them to [[summon nasties]] or even employ the [[touch of death]]. Furthermore, as angelic beings they do not respect sanctuary or [[Elbereth]].

Fortunately, they also lack any actual resistances and can potentially be brought down from afar before getting into casting range - your best options for this may be high-enchanted [[missile]] weapons or an attack spell such as {{spell of|magic missile}}. [[Magic resistance]], good AC and a well-enchanted weapon (typically an [[artifact weapon]] at the stage you encounter them) are highly recommended when facing a ki-rin in melee. Interestingly, an [[applied]] [[mirror]] can still scare them 80% of the time.

===As pets===
Ki-rin are highly sought-after [[pet]]s for their flight, base 18 speed, fighting power, and -5 AC, to the point that some players will use a [[wish]] for a blessed [[figurine]] of one. Their MR of 90 makes them very difficult to tame normally, but also ensures they will never buck you off a saddle due to [[conflict]] unless they are [[level drain]]ed below 15. Additionally, ki-rin will cast [[haste self]], giving them the same speed as an unhasted [[warhorse]] or [[unicorn]].

Ki-rin also also among the best choice of [[steed]] for [[Knight]]s and other roles capable of advancing the riding skill - they are also among the most likely to survive a trip through [[Gehennom]]. However, even a ki-rin will have trouble surviving the [[Elemental Planes]], and their lack of resistances often spells doom on the [[Plane of Fire]]. Furthermore, they are inediate and thus cannot have their tameness raised – a [[charm monster|charmed]] or [[scroll of taming|tamed]] ki-rin ridden by any non-Knight will inevitably be untamed after being mounted, kicked, or whipped five times. Knights are thus the only role that can reliably keep a tame ki-rin for long amounts of time. Non-Knights should not dismount their ki-rin steed unless absolutely necessary, and should ideally have Basic riding skill before obtaining one.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Ki-rin now have poison resistance, and are no longer considered [[animal]]s. They also now have the ability to cure themselves using their horns, like [[unicorn horn]]s. As they do not leave corpses, they do not drop their horns either. Pets that eat corpses can also gain intrinsics from them, making the inediate ki-rin a slightly weaker choice for a pet in the long term; fortunately, a ki-rin's survival chances are buffed due to their poison resistance and horns can aid them in surviving the Plane of Fire's [[poison cloud|gas plumes]].}}

==History==
The ki-rin, {{yellow|u}}, first appears in [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], where it was a part of the [[quadruped]] [[monster class]]. The ki-rin is introduced to vanilla ''NetHack'' alongside the other angelic beings in [[NetHack 3.1.0]], and its glyph was changed to {{yellow|A}}; it retains this glyph for its appearance in [[NetHack-- 3.1.3]].

From [[NetHack 3.4.1]] to [[NetHack 3.4.3]], including many variants based on these versions, ki-rin were able to wear amulets, boots, shields, and gloves despite being non-humanoid - this was [[Bug#C341-18|bug C341-18]], and is fixed in [[NetHack 3.6.0]]. Outfitting a ki-rin with an [[amulet of reflection|amulet]] or [[shield of reflection|shield]] in these versions was a popular choice for pet-keeping players, both to augment their already-formidable AC and protect against rays from a [[wand of death]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Qilin}}
The '''qilin''', or ''kirin'', is a chimerical quadruped creature that appears in Chinese folklore, and is said to appear with the imminent arrival or passing of a sage or illustrious ruler. The earliest references to the qilin occur in the 5th century BCE - its legendary image became associated with the image of the giraffe in the Ming dynasty after Zheng He's 15th-century voyage to East Africa. Qilin are described as quiet-hooved herbivores with a reputed ability to "walk on grass without disturbing it", which may be related to the giraffe's long, thin legs. The qilin is also described as having antlers like a deer and scales like a dragon or fish.

In modern times, "qilin" is sometimes translated into English as "[[unicorn]]" due to the qilin sometimes having a single horn. This can be misleading, as a number of different Chinese mythical creatures can be depicted with a single horn, and such a qilin would be called a "one-horned qilin" in Chinese. With this in mind, the qilin and unicorn are often given similar traits in contemporary and modern portrayals.<!--This includes the ability to cure themselves with their horn in 3.7.0.-->

==Variants==
Variants based on 3.4.3 that intentionally leave bug C341-18 intact may allow a ki-rin to wear additional equipment. 

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], tame ki-rin can be given as [[minion]]s to [[lawful]] players at [[experience level]]s 13 to 19 via sacrifice or [[prayer]], though minions cannot be saddled or ridden. SLASH'EM incorporates bug C341-18 as a feature, allowing ki-rin to wear amulets and non-body armor. Ki-rin can obtain reflection from an amulet or shield of reflection - they are not level-drain or stoning resistant, however, so an [[amulet of drain resistance]] or an [[amulet versus stone]] is also a good option for their amulet slot.

Ki-rin require a +3 weapon to hit, while their attacks hit as +3 weapons. This makes them even better as pets and steeds, rendering them immune to physical attacks from powerful [[minotaur]]s and even some [[demon prince]]s - but it also makes them far more dangerous should you encounter a hostile one. 

===EvilHack===
[[EvilHack]] introduces the [[eldritch ki-rin]], a "fallen angel" ki-rin that serves as a chaotic counterpart. As such, they can appear in Gehennom and cannot be tamed by lawful Knights; they are an excellent steed choice for chaotic Knights, who can tame them (but ''not'' standard ki-rin).

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|The ki-rin is a strange-looking flying creature.  It has
scales, a mane like a lion, a tail, hooves, and a horn.  It
is brightly colored, and can usually be found flying in the
sky looking for good deeds to reward.

The '''Archon''', {{monsym|Archon}}, is a powerful monster that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Archons are the most powerful of the [[angelic being]]s, and have the second highest [[difficulty level]] of all randomly generated monsters after the [[arch-lich]]. They are large [[humanoid]]s that are capable of [[flight]], can [[see invisible]], possess [[regeneration]], and can [[follow]] you to other levels.

An Archon can attack five times per turn, including an active gaze attack that [[blind]]s and [[stun]]s you and a set of mage [[monster spell]]s up to and including the [[touch of death]].

==Generation==
Archons will always generate as peaceful for [[lawful]] characters of non-negative [[alignment record]], and cannot be selected for [[genocide]] or [[polymorph]]. As a [[M2_LORD|lord]] to its kind, a randomly-generated Archon [[Monster starting inventory|will always have]] a [[rustproof]] [[long sword]] and a [[shield of reflection]] - if neither [[Demonbane]] nor [[Sunsword]] have been created in that game, the long sword will be converted to either of the two artifacts.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|332|nethack=3.6.6}} Archons [[corpseless|do not leave corpses]] upon death.

In terms of random generation, Archons have such high [[difficulty]] that even for a [[player]] at [[experience level]] 30, they cannot appear before [[dungeon level]] 22. Since the [[Dungeons of Doom]] end around level 29 and Archons cannot be generated in [[Gehennom]], most characters will not see one before finding the [[Amulet of Yendor]]. There are two particular locations of note that an Archon can appear in:

* The random angelic being generated when using the second version of [[Medusa's Island]] can be an Archon, but the odds are quite low.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1311|nethack=3.6.6}}
* [[Vlad's Tower]] is not technically part of Gehennom, making it possible for one to generate, though its chaotic bias makes them exceedingly rare. 

Once you have the Amulet, your effective dungeon level is at least 45, so Archons may be randomly generated from the [[Castle]] up.

Archons are not eligible for the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]], but can cast the spell themselves and may appear in place of a summoned nasty that was genocided - this can very rarely result in what is called an "[[Archonstorm]]". Archons can also appear as the minions of lawful [[god]]s, but are almost never seen in this capacity unless you actively set up the required circumstances.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7|Demonbane is now a [[mace]], but Archons still only receive a long sword, so they can no longer generate with Demonbane.}}

==Strategy==
Archons are among the most difficult non-unique monsters to take on in a straight fight - they have a stellar base [[AC]] of -6, and Archons with a shield of reflection will deflect any kind of ray-based spell, including [[death ray]]s. They are also capable of wielding nearly the entire arsenal of mage monster spells against you, which spells a quick end if they get within melee range and you lack [[magic resistance]]. Furthermore, they ignore [[Elbereth]], cannot be scared off by standing on a [[scroll of scare monster]], and cannot be blinded by sources such as an [[expensive camera]]. In most cases, it is wiser to avoid them and keep moving, which can be aided by exploiting their inability to unlock doors; peaceful Archons are considered a significant advantage of being lawful.

For others, beyond possessing magic resistance, the best way to fight an Archon is to use a [[footrice]] corpse and [[blind]] yourself to protect against their gaze; wearing [[the Eyes of the Overworld]] also prevents you from being stunned or blinded by this attack. Another option is to try using [[Vorpal Blade]], which can still decapitate them. 

===Archonstorm===
{{main|Archonstorm}}
Excessive use of [[genocide]] may lead to an "Archonstorm", a scenario in which overwhelming numbers of hostile Archons begin to appear in the [[endgame]] in place of other high-level monsters that have been genocided. NPlayers can keep the chances of such a scenario low by using genocide sparingly; while lawful humans incur a &minus;1 alignment penalty for each genocide,  associated with it.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Summon nasties can no longer create monsters of equal or higher difficulty than the caster (preventing, e.g., arch-liches or Archons from summoning more of themselves).}}

===As pets===
Archons are exceedingly popular as pets due to their power: they are inediate, hard-hitting and have far more capabilities compared to a tamed arch-lich. Archons are too large for body armor, but can wear other armor (i.e., [[gloves]], [[helm]]s, [[boots]], and [[shield]]s), and will pick up and use a variety of items. Getting an Archon to drop their starting weapon can be difficult; applying a [[bullwhip]] towards them can strip them of their current weapon, allowing you to hand them another weapon or enchant their initial one before handing it back.

Archons are permanently [[fast]] after they cast [[haste self]] and will use their blinding gaze frequently against enemies (though it does not stun them in exactly the same way it would stun you). Additionally, an Archon's [[monster magic resistance|MR score]] of 80 allows it to always ignore [[conflict]] from a ring once it reaches level 25, or level 30 for a weapon; a level 32 or higher Archon will also be immune to [[polymorph trap]]s. However, there is no way to make an Archon immune to [[level teleporter]]s, so beware if an Archon runs into one - they will likely be untamed by the time you find them again.

====Obtaining a pet Archon====
The easiest way to obtain a pet Archon is to apply a blessed [[figurine]] of an Archon; wishing for this figurine is a common [[pacifist]] goal. However, an Archon from a figurine will not generate with its standard inventory of a longsword and shield of reflection, and without reflection it is vulnerable to death rays and [[disintegration]] breath. The figurine also has a 10% chance of spawning a hostile Archon, so try to have an [[escape item]] handy in case.

As an alternative to the figurine, a lawful character might wish for a [[statue]] of an Archon, {{spell of|stone to flesh}} it, and then cast {{spell of|charm monster}}. Although this is more difficult and requires a fairly advanced spellcaster, the Archon will never come to life as hostile for a lawful character with positive alignment record, making this a safer option.

Another alternative is for a high-level character to tame a randomly-generated Archon with a charm monster spell, but this will often require several attempts due to its high monster magic resistance, which can be painful if the Archon is hostile. The most difficult portion of this may well be finding a random Archon: on top of requiring a high experience level, the Castle and Vlad's Tower are the likeliest areas, and the latter has a bias towards generating chaotic monsters. The {{spell of|create monster}} spell can be used to create many monsters quickly, but be sure not to expend so much [[energy]] that you cannot cast charm monster afterward. Once you find an Archon, draining their level will make the spell more reliable - the best tools for this are [[the Staff of Aesculapius]] or [[Stormbringer]], as other level-draining methods will take far longer. If there is a [[magic trap]] nearby, you might consider repeatedly triggering it and hoping for the taming effect, which ignores monster MR.

==History==
The Archon first appears in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

From 3.1.0 to [[NetHack 3.4.3]], a figurine of an Archon would generate the monster with its usual starting inventory.

==Origin==
In the early literary period of ancient Greece, the word ''Archon'' (Greek: ἄρχων, ''arkhon'') was used to mean "ruler" and frequently occurred in the title of a specific public office, e.g. the chief magistrates of various Greek city states were called ''archontes''. The Archon as a monster is derived from the celestial archons introduced in the 2nd Edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' - these are distinct from "elemental archons", worshipers of an elemental lord who gained the powers of one of the four elements. Celestial Archons came in nine distinct varieties: Hound, Justice, Lantern, Sword, Tome, Throne, Trumpet, Warden, and Word. Throne archons were the second highest in rank of the archons that occupied a hierarchy, and served the higher-ranking Tome archons.

The Archons of ''NetHack'' are most closely modeled after Throne archons, particularly including their high resistance to magic and weapons as well as their "penitentiary gaze" (analogous to the blinding and stunning gaze attack in ''NetHack''). This gaze overwhelmed any creature that was not lawful good with remorse for their sins; it could even manifest the guilt of evil creatures as painful boils, and produced highly realistic and draining visions in creatures that were more chaotic. A Throne archon that was forced to fight used this gaze to exhaust foes into submission before attempting to decapitate them with their greatswords.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the dungeon is much deeper, creating a higher probability of encountering an Archon before the castle. Archons can also be obtained as tame minions through [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] from experience levels 19 to 25.

Archons have their base AC boosted to -10, [[Need +x weapon to hit|require a +4 weapon to hit]] and hit as +4 weapons themselves, and have additional [[death resistance|resistance to death rays]]. The [[Planetar and Solar]] are the only angelic beings that outclass the Archon in terms of sheer power, possessing stronger versions of the same attacks - Archons are still a stellar choice for pets, and can more easily be obtained outside of wishing for a figurine (which follows 3.4.3 rules).

Using [[firearms]] to fire +4 or higher [[bullet]]s can bypass the reflection granted by an Archon's shield, and is among the most reliable ways of bringing one down in combat.

===dNetHack===
{{main|Archon (dNetHack)}}
Archons in [[dNetHack]] are split into 7 varieties. The counterpart to the vanilla Archon is a [[Archon (dNetHack)#Throne Archon|Throne Archon]]. In addition, as the #loot command can now take items from pets, it's much easier to remove Sunsword or Demonbane and give them a different artifact or a non-artifact enchanted weapon.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], the random {{mcsl|V}} and {{mcsl|L}} generated on the Astral Plane are replaced with random {{white|A}}, making it much likelier that you will encounter one or more Archons there.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Archons are the predominant inhabitants of the heavens.
However unusual their appearance, they are not generally
evil.  They are beings at peace with themselves and their
surroundings.

The '''horned devil''', {{monsym|horned devil}}, is a [[major demon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
The horned devil is flagged to only appear in [[Gehennom]], but [[monster frequency|will not be randomly generated there]] since it is [[lawful]]. This trait also occurs with [[barbed devil]]s and the [[erinys]] - all three are still eligible to be generated via [[gating]] by other major demons. Horned devils can also be summoned if the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]] is cast in Gehennom or by a lawful spellcaster.{{refsrc|src/wizard.c|44|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Horned devils also serve as [[minion]]s for chaotic gods and [[Moloch]].

Horned devils may be generated in [[graveyard]]s. In addition, [[Asmodeus' Lair|the lairs of Asmodeus]] [[Baalzebub's Lair|and Baalzebub]] will each contain a horned devil upon normal level creation.{{refsrc|dat/gehennom.des|492|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|dat/gehennom.des|578|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Another horned devil appears within [[Moloch's Sanctum]], placed just outside the temple near its southeast corner.{{refsrc|dat/gehennom.des|689|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

They are [[Monster starting inventory|generated with]] either a [[trident]] (75% chance) or a [[bullwhip]] (25% chance).{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|496|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
The horned devil is considered the weakest of the major demons by the game, with lower [[monster difficulty]] and hit die but better [[AC]] than the barbed devil. It also has a lower difficulty than the [[water demon]], who has an AC closer to the horned devil's but also possesses weaker hit die; this is likely because the water demon is faster and can swim.

Horned devils are slower than an unhasted player, and a [[fast]] well-armored character with a well-enchanted blessed and/or silver weapon will have relatively little trouble dispatching one - a [[wand of cold|wand]] or [[cone of cold]] can eliminate them in one or two shots. However, they can still pose a significant threat if they disarm you with their bullwhip, which [[Speed ascension|speedrunners]] in particular will find a major nuisance - having [[Excalibur]] yanked out of your hand, e.g. in the middle of a pitched fight against [[Asmodeus]] or [[Baalzebub]], can be fatal.

Horned devils are a decent source of tridents and bullwhips for those looking to utilize either.

==History==
The horned devil is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], chaotic players have a chance of receiving a horned devil minion as a servant from sacrificing while at any experience level ranging from 10 to 16.

Four horned devils appear in [[Dispater's lair (SLASH'EM)|the newly-added lair of]] [[Dispater]]. There is also a {{frac|10}} chance that a [[lemure]] pit [[Special room (SLASH'EM)|special room]] may contain a horned devil.

===UnNetHack===
As with SLASH'EM, the is a {{frac|10}} chance of the [[lemure pit]] [[Special room (UnNetHack)|special room]] containing a horned devil.

===Lethe patch===
In the restructured [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)|Gehennom]] featured within the [[Lethe patch]], Baalzebub's lair contains 5 horned devils.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], horned devils are given a passive quill attack.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], [[The Idol of Moloch]] is an [[artifact]] [[figurine]] of a horned devil and the [[Infidel]] [[quest artifact]]. It can be applied like a normal figurine to summon a random major demon, including a horned devil, without using up the artifact.

The '''erinys''' (plural '''erinyes'''), {{monsym|erinys}}, is a major [[demon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are always female, and possess a single weapon attack that can [[poison]] you.

==Generation==
Erinyes become [[extinct]] after three have been generated, and cannot be genocided otherwise. {{refsrc|makemon.c|1399|nethack=3.6.1|comment=Monster birth limit.}}

As erinyes are both lawful and major demons, they are not eligible for random generation either inside or outside [[Gehennom]], nor are they an eligible [[polymorph]] form for you or monsters. Erinyes would appear in small [[group]]s were they capable of random generation.

Erinyes are only generated in certain specific circumstances:

* They can appear in [[graveyard]]s, including those within Gehennom.
* They can be [[demon gating|gated in]] by the melee attacks of [[barbed devils]] and [[horned devils]], as well as lawful demon princes, i.e. [[Geryon]], [[Dispater]], [[Baalzebub]] and [[Asmodeus]].
* The random {{mcsl|&}} in [[Asmodeus' Lair]] can include erinyes.
* One can be summoned via the [[summon nasties]] spell when cast by spellcasting monsters that are lawful (usually a [[titan]]) or in Gehennom (e.g. [[the Wizard of Yendor]]).
* They are one of the [[minion]]s [[Moloch]] may send after you if you attempt to convert an [[altar]] of his outside Gehennom.
* One is guaranteed to appear in [[Moloch's Sanctum]], if they're not extinct by then.

Of note is that [[apply]]ing [[figurine]]s respects the special generation limits of erinyes, save for the similar case of [[Nazgul]]s, it does not respect extinction otherwise.

==Strategy==
Erinyes are as fast as a player character is normally, but most players will have [[poison resistance]] if not a source of [[speed]], and their weapon attack is not particularly strong. Erinyes are also far weaker than most other major demons and usually trivial to dispatch - it is fairly easy to render erinyes extinct through normal play without any attention to [[conduct]]s like extinctionism.

==History==
The erinys is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Erinyes}}
Per the encyclopedia entry, the Erinyes (more commonly known as the Furies) were female chthonic deities of vengeance that appeared in ancient Greek religion and folklore - the Romans themselves referred to them as "Furiae" in their earthly incarnations. The Erinyes play a major part in the "Oresteia" trilogy of tragedies, especially embodying their themes of justice and revenge.

The Erinyes were commonly associated with night and darkness, and dwelled in Erebus where they heard complaints of insolence brought to them by mortals, punishing such crimes by hounding the culprits relentlessly. They were depicted as crones, with varying sources giving them various traits such as snakes for hair, dog's heads, coal black bodies, bat's wings, and blood-shot eyes. While their number is usually left indeterminate, they were often described as three maiden goddesses - Virgil in particular would recognize three named Erinyes, which would be carried on into later literature such as the ''Inferno'' of Dante Aligheri).

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], a [[gypsy]] drawing the card Justice summons an erinys; this does not respect extinction.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], erinyes are no longer limited to a maximum of three generated per game.

The '''barbed devil''', {{monsym|barbed devil}}, is a kind of [[major demon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
Barbed devils are flagged to appear only in [[Gehennom]], but no [[lawful]] creatures can be randomly generated there; thus, they are effectively [[monster frequency|never randomly generated]]. They share this trait with [[horned devil]]s and [[erinyes]].

Barbed devils may be created in [[group]]s wherever they <em>do</em> appear, and are valid forms for a [[polymorph trap]], which may result in them appearing much earlier in the main dungeon. They are also eligible for [[gating]] by other major demons.

==Strategy==
Barbed devils have stronger attacks than [[horned devil]]s, but possess weaker AC. Their damage is unimpressive for the point at which they are normally encountered, and even in groups they are not much threat to a player skilled in dealing with demons or multiple opponents.

A '''marilith''', {{monsym|marilith}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Mariliths are [[major demon]]s that can deal damage extremely quickly, and possess six attacks per move - two 2d4 primary weapon attacks and four 2d4 claw attacks.

==Generation==
Like most demons, the marilith is randomly generated only in [[Gehennom]]; it is also a valid form for [[polymorph trap]]s that appear in other branches of the dungeon. Mariliths are also eligible for [[gating]] by other major demons, and can generate as [[minion]]s of chaotic [[god]]s and the unaligned [[Moloch]].

A marilith appears in the courtyard of the temple within [[Moloch's Sanctum]]. 

==Strategy==
Mariliths are dangerous foes to run into before Gehennom, and remain troublesome to face even once a play is prepared for the depths of Hell - they have a stellar natural [[AC]] of -6 and 80 [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]], can [[see invisible]], and move at the same base [[speed]] as you. Be well-armored and have your best weapons at the ready if one approaches - a blessed, [[silver]] and/or well-enchanted weapon at around [[Skilled]] level should do her in quickly.

===As pets===
Mariliths make excellent [[pet]]s due to their six attacks and natural AC, which compensates for their inability to wear armor outside of [[gloves]] and a [[helm]] - though equipping them with powerful items and weapons is also much more straightforward as a result. Their other main drawbacks include their weakness to silver, [[inediate]] diet and comparatively low HP; additionally, a marilith that is killed will not leave a [[corpse]] to revive. Due to their high monster MR, gating them yourself is one of the more reliable methods for obtaining a tame marilith.

===As polyform===
Mariliths are even better as polyforms, though turning into one will break worn [[body armor]], and you are similarly restricted to boots, gloves and non-silver weapons. Fortunately, you can #[[twoweapon]] as a marilith if your original role can, and the marilith's bare-handed melee attacks have the greatest chance to gate in other tame demons, which are also likely to be mariliths.

==History==
The marilith first appears with most other major demons in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Marilith}}
The marilith originates from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where they are depicted as serpentine demons with six arms and a humanoid; they are always female, and can wield up to six weapons simultaneously. Their appearance may take cues from Hindu folklore, whose deities and demons frequently possess multiple heads and arms; serpentine creatures such as the [[Naga]] may also have multiple heads and/or limbs as well.

''Dungeons & Dragons'' mariliths (also known  briefly as "type V demons") are highly intelligent and disciplined, with a good sense for strategy, tactics and martial combat. They serve as commanders to demon hordes, with the rare ability to unite and coordinate the otherwise-chaotic beings. Mariliths favor longswords or scimitars and consider their weapons to be their most cherished possessions; they are also capable of casting illusions and charms among other spells, and can use their tails to lash and/or constrict their foes.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], chaotic gods may send you a tame marilith minion as a sacrifice gift from experience levels 22 to 27.

The marilith's low level works in the favor of [[Doppelganger (starting race)|Dopplegangers]], who can reliably turn into mariliths at experience level 7 and potentially gate in others with bare-handed attacks, though they only get 5 per move due to the lack of twoweapon skill; other races can also do so with [[polymorph control]]. As in vanilla, gating via polyself is generally preferable if you want a tame marilith, since it can be done at a much lower level and minions cannot be given equipment like pets.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], at least two mariliths are placed in the same room as [[Asmodeus]] and his [[throne]] within the demon prince's lair when his level is generated; additional mariliths may be among the major demons generated in the fountain room at level creation.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], [[shalosh tannah]] can spawn strange larvae that may quickly grow into mariliths and other major demons with organic equipment.

[[Kary, the Fiend of Fire]] is a unique marilith that has somewhat lower defenses, but has [[cold resistance|cold]] and [[stoning resistance]] along with two additional attacks that randomly occur in her routine - a 4d6 bearhug attack, and a spell randomly selected from a set of three that may [[blind]] you, [[stun]] you, or target you with a powerful blast of fire. Kary is the name originally given to the Marilith boss from the first ''Final Fantasy'' game in order to avoid potential copyright issues with ''Dungeons & Dragons''.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
The marilith has a torso shaped like that of a human female,
and the lower body of a great snake. It has multiple arms,
and can freely attack with all of them. Since it is
intelligent enough to use weapons, this means it can cause
great damage.

The '''vrock''', {{monsym|vrock}}, is a type of [[demon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. As implied by its encyclopedia entry, it appears as a sort of human-vulture hybrid.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Per [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/4b525374d039420916be2f002f5d32a98c046996 commit 4b52537]: vrocks can now emit a plume of [[poison cloud]]s when fleeing, similar to the [[scroll of stinking cloud]].}}

==Generation==
Vrocks are randomly generated only in [[Gehennom]], and may be created in small [[group]]s of 2-4 {{frac|2}} of the time; they may also be among the demons generated when a [[graveyard]] is created. The vrock is also a valid [[polymorph]] form, and so may appear in other branches of the dungeon due to [[polymorph trap]]s.

Vrocks are eligible for [[gating]] by other major demons, and may appear as the [[minion]] of a chaotic [[god]] or [[Moloch]].

==Strategy==
Vrocks have a decent [[AC]] of 0, move at the same [[speed]] as an un-hasted, unburdened hero and possess five attacks per turn. Despite their relative weakness compared to other demons, these make vrocks potentially deadly to a player facing them early due to polymorph traps: they are notorious for gating in even more vrocks, potentially filling the area and cornering you. Though a decently enchanted weapon and solid AC can be enough, the quicker you can eliminate an unexpected vrock, the better; they are much easier to deal with in Gehennom, by which point you will have much more AC and a highly enchanted blessed and/or silver weapon.

==History==
The vrock first appears with many other demons in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
Vrocks (pronounced: /vrɑːkz/, ''vrahkz'') originate from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where they were also known as "type I demons"; they are described as bestial and appear as crosses between humanoids and vultures, as indicated by their tile and encyclopedia entry. Vrocks are brutish demons that enjoy fighting, and are capricious and selfish even by the standards of other demons – nonetheless, small flocks are more than capable of coordination and group tactics.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161031212919/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060606a Minions of the Abyss (Part 1): Winning Tactics Against Vrocks] by Eric Cagle</ref>

Vrocks can emit bloodcurdling screeches loud enough to cause nearby victims physical pain and daze them; this is employed as a means of securing escape rather than an offensive tool. Vrocks can also release clouds of tiny poisonous spores from their wings that grew into thick vine-like structures after burrowing under the skin of those nearby.

In [[dNetHack]], vrocks are described with a more animal-like anatomy to reflect their vulture-like features; their base experience is increased, and they have three damage dice instead of five, though the dice themselves are stronger and include a weapon attack. Vrocks are [[strong]] and capable of using [[polearm]]s in melee, have 10 points of natural damage reduction, and emit a [[stun]]-inducing shriek while retreating.

===Generation===
Vrock are more widespread throughout Gehennom and other levels:

* A vrock generates in The Temple of Moloch's main area on level creation, as in SLASH'EM.
* A vrock is generated on the Mordor Fortress floor of the [[Mordor Ruins Quest|Mordor Ruins]] [[Chaos quest (dNethack)|Chaos Quest]].
* Many are generated on the third variant map of Brine Flats's third floor within Gehennom.
* The vaults of [[Lolth]] have four vrocks within the "upstairs" portal room.

Vrocks are one of the demons that can be summoned by reading the [[Necronomicon]], with a {{frac|2|15}} chance.

[[Shalosh tannah]] have a {{frac|9}} chance of producing strange larvae each turn that can quickly grow into vrocks and other major demons with organic equipment.

The '''hezrou''', {{monsym|hezrou}}, is a [[demon]] in [[NetHack]]. They are slow, but can hit fairly hard.

Hezrou are large and incapable of wearing any body armor; however, they can put on [[helm]]s, [[boots]] and [[gloves]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Hezrous now leave [[poison cloud]]s as they move.}}

==Generation==
Hezrou are normally only generated in [[Gehennom]], but are also valid [[polymorph]] forms, e.g. from a [[polymorph trap]]; this makes it a potential nasty surprise for players.

Like any [[major demon]] outside of the [[balrog]] and [[foocubus]], the hezrou can summon other demons when attacking, and is eligible for [[gating]]; polymorphing into a hezrou and attacking a monster with bare or gloved hands grants a {{frac|13}} chance per hit landed to summon other tame demons. ('''"Some hell-p has arrived!"''')

== Strategy ==
Hezrou are not particularly threatening by the time they are generated, due to their slow speed and relatively paltry damage; however, a monster polymorphed into a hezrou by a trap fairly early in the dungeon can be a deadly threat. Unlike other demons, however, the hezrou's lack of speed makes it easier for you to avoid, and it shares the usual demonic weaknesses to [[cold]] and [[silver]].

If you find yourself polymorphed into a hezrou as the result of a trap, destroying your body armor, gating in some pet hezrou can serve as a means of defense until you find replacement armor.

The '''bone devil''', {{monsym|bone devil}}, is a [[major demon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
The bone devil is only randomly generated in [[Gehennom]], and is also a valid form for a [[polymorph trap]], which may result in it appearing much earlier. Bone devils are also eligible for [[gating]] by other major demons.

==Strategy==
Bone devils are decently fast, with a weapon attack and a [[poison]]ous sting that can drain [[strength]] unless the player has [[poison resistance]]. Like most demons, it is vulnerable to [[silver]] and [[cold]] attacks. 

However, their -1 AC pales somewhat in comparison to other major demons such as [[horned devil]]s, and they are not particularly threatening to an average player that has reached Gehennom. The bone devil's low AC can still make it a potential nasty surprise for earlier players if another hostile monster is polymorphed into one, unless they are sufficiently prepared and have poison resistance. 

As a potential form for [[pet]]s led onto polymorph traps, a bone devil is a decent tame monster to have, although the below-average [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] may interfere with further attempts to change its form if you are aiming for something else.

An '''ice devil''', {{monsym|ice devil}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is a [[major demon]] that can [[see invisible]] and has a [[cold]]-element sting along with two claw attacks and a bite; it has [[fire resistance]], [[cold resistance]] and [[poison resistance]] as well as the standard major demon immunity to death magic.

==Generation==
Ice devils are only randomly generated in [[Gehennom]], and are also a valid [[polymorph]] form for [[shapeshifter]]s and [[polymorph trap]]s. Ice devils are also eligible for [[gating]] by other major demons, and may appear as the [[minion]] of a chaotic [[god]].

Ice devils have a {{frac|4}} chance of [[Monster starting inventory|being generated with]] a [[spear]]; this is handled in a separate area of [[makemon.c]] from other monsters, as ice devils do not have a weapon attack.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|770|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Above this line, a comment reads "moved here from m_initweap() because these don't have AT_WEAP so m_initweap() is not called for them"}} They will never receive random [[offensive item]]s.

==Strategy==
Ice devils are much slower than their other demonic kin, with half the [[speed]] of a normal character, but make up for it with a solid -4 [[AC]] and a set of four attacks that can inflict decent damage if they all land. Polymorph traps and shapeshifters such as [[chameleon]]s mean that unfortunate players can encounter one far earlier than normal, and possibly before they are prepared - the cold sting is especially threatening without cold resistance, and their gating ability may spell doom if they manage to swarm you. A player with decent AC and a well-enchanted [[blessed]] and/or [[silver]] weapon can take advantage of their low speed to make short work of them - note that ice devils resist cold damage unlike most other demons.

As pets, ice devils are decent well into the mid-game and can be used to take out peaceful monsters such as the [[Minetown]] [[watch]] or [[aligned priest|temple priest]] - their natural -4 AC compensates for an inability to wear torso armor. However, their low speed tends to make transportation a chore unless you have a [[magic whistle]] or blessed [[eucalyptus]] leaf available.

==History==
The ice devil is introduced alongside many other major demons in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
The ice devil originates from the 1st edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where it is a type of greater devil that populates the various planes of Hell, and were most common on the fifth and eighth layers.

Ice devils (or gelugons in later editions) appear as large semi-insectoid creatures that served as generals for Hell's infernal legions, though they were often ill-suited due to their hatred of weakness and desire to battle alone - a guard of nearly 10,000 ice devils guarded the portal to Hell's ninth plane. Ice devils also served as personal guards and elite warriors for other powerful devils and mortals; each ice devil tirelessly pursued promotion into the more powerful [[pit fiend]].

Ice devils favored unarmed combat and would target frontlines and other weaker foes first, savagely using their claws, pincers and tails to tear into foes. They also exuded an aura of numbing cold which slowed enemies that failed a save versus paralysis; one in every four or so would also utilize a spear that was similarly capable of paralyzing foes with its frost. They were also proficient at wizardry, particularly including cold-oriented spells, and could gate in other devils for assistance. Though vicious in battle and unlikely to shy away from necessary fights, ice devils were goal-oriented and fought either to complete their mission or secure an easy victory if they saw one.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the ice devil's difficulty is raised to 17.

Ice devils may be generated as peaceful minions for a [[chaotic]] player at [[experience level]]s 27 to 30 via [[sacrifice]] or [[prayer]].

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], ice devils are far stronger on offense: their two claw attacks are replaced with 4d4 primary and off-hand weapon attacks, and their cold sting deals 5d4 damage. Ice devils can also appear among the default "prisoners" within the cells of a [[Special room (dNetHack)#Throne room (throne occupied)|throne room]] that has no special ruler.

In the lower Hell map that contains the [[creature in the ice]], 25 ice devils are placed randomly around the level.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], the ice devil's sting will instead inflict [[fumbling]] on you if it hits.

===notdNetHack===
In [[notdNetHack]], the [[Ice Caves]] adventure branch has two hostile ice devils guarding the barred-off altar within its [[Minetown]]. notdNetHack also includes the same ice devil-populated map containing the creature in the ice as one of the possible lower Hell maps.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the ice devil's speed is increased to 9. An ice devil statue can be found among the demon statues in the hidden temple of the [[Infidel quest]]'s home level.

Four hostile ice devils are found in the [[Ice Queen's Realm]], with one pair stationed outside the temple and the other pair residing within; ice devils are also the only demons that can be summoned via gating within the dungeon branch, as it is too cold for any other kind of demon.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/v0.8.0/src/minion.c#L70 EvilHack 0.8.0 src/minion.c, line 70]</ref>

The third-tier demon prince [[Asmodeus]] has an ice devil as part of his entourage if he appears in [[Gehennom]].

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, [[SlashTHEM]] generates a pair of ice devil statues on one of the possible [[Lethe Gorge]]-derived maps for Gehennom that contains a [[migo]] hive.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Ice devils are large semi-insectoid creatures, who are
equally at home in the fires of Hell and the cold of Limbo,
and who can cause the traveller to feel the latter with just
a touch of their tail.

&&%s&& %s Lethe patch {94389 2015-05-25T10:31:40Z {443 Kahran042}  {{wikipedia|Lethe}}
The '''Lethe patch''' is a patch for [[NetHack 3.3.1]] by Michael Clarke.

It adds several new monsters (including some from the Cthulhu Mythos) and amnesia-causing water in potions and moats.

It adds a new branch, the [[Lethe Gorge]], between Medusa and the Valley of the Dead and features a completely revamped [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)|Gehennom]].

For the SLASH'EM version see [[SLethe]].

==Origin==

Lethe means forgetfulness in Greek(Λήθη). The lethe river was one of the five rivers of Hades(the underground kingdom of the dead in ancient Greek mythology). Who ever drank from its water, was struck with complete forgetfulness. Hence the lethe river with amnesia causing lethe water flowing through the lethe gorge and in to [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)|Gehennom]].

The '''pit fiend''', {{monsym|pit fiend}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is a [[major demon]] with two weapon attacks and a crushing grab attack; like all major demons, it has [[fire resistance]], [[poison resistance]] and immunity to death magic.

Pit fiends generate [[YAFM]] when falling into [[pits]], which they share with [[pit viper]]s.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|1226|version=NetHack 3.6.6|name=dotrap}}{{refsrc|src/trap.c|2469|version=NetHack 3.6.6|name=mintrap}}

==Generation==
Pit fiends are only randomly generated in [[Gehennom]], and are also a valid [[polymorph]] form for [[shapeshifter]]s and [[polymorph trap]]s. Pit fiends are also eligible for [[gating]] by other major demons, and may appear as the [[minion]] of a chaotic [[god]].

Three pit fiends each are generated on the [[Plane of Earth]] and [[Plane of Fire]].

==Strategy==
Pit fiends are especially perilous if you encounter them earlier than normal due to shapeshifters or polymorph traps; their natural -3 AC can make escaping one difficult if it grabs you. They are quite slow at 6 [[speed]] however, however - [[Elbereth]] can be useful to drive them off and kite them, and you can also teleport yourself if grabbed, allowing you to escape or else prepare a means of fighting back (e.g. with a [[wand of cold]] or [[silver]] weapon).

In Gehennom where they normally occur, they are not as much of a threat - most players at this point will have a silver weapon or two, a few methods to deal cold damage, and better AC themselves along with a much more reliable hit-rate.

==History==
The pit fiend is introduced alongside many other major demons in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
The pit fiend originates from the 1st edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where it is a type of greater devil that primarily occupies the ninth and deepest layer of hell.

Originating as the personal servants of [[Asmodeus]], pit fiends were the most powerful of the non-unique devils and acted as elite overseers of Hell itself. They were hulking, scale-armored humanoids with a pair of massive bat-like wings, fearsome claws, venomous fangs, and prehensile tails - pit fiends fought using these natural abilities alongside others that included cloaking themselves in flames or an aura of fear, turning themselves invisible, and various forms of creating and manipulating flame. A pit fiend was tyrannical and narcissistic: they were capable of cunning beyond measure and expert at terrifying lesser devils and mortals alike, though they were also prone to hubris and could not conceive the possibility of failure. Pit fiends could surpass their already mountainous power with training, and the greatest were promoted beyond the normal ranks into dukes, a unique form of devil with its own special abilities. 

Pit fiends were made from worthy [[ice devil]]s or [[erinyes]] who were subjected to the devil-scorching hellfire of the Pit of Flame for 1,001 days. Others could be created through the blood of Asmodeus himself: each drop became a greater devil, most often a pit fiend, and such beings had a fanatical loyalty to Asmodeus; they could also spawn lesser devils from their shed blood as well. The Dark Eight was a coven of pit fiend generals who directed Hell's armies and culture, and were in turn kept in line by Asmodeus and the other archdevils.

==Messages==
{{message|How pitiful. Isn't that the pits?|You saw a pit fiend fall into a pit, or fell into one while polymorphed into a pit fiend.<ref name="dotrap"/><ref name="mintrap"/>}}

==Variants==
===Lethe patch===
In the [[Lethe patch]], [[Demogorgon]]'s lair in [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)#Demogorgon's lair|Gehennom]] has four pit fiends - one next to Demogorgon's [[throne]], two others within the fortress, and the fourth guarding the down [[stair]].

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], pit fiends may be generated as peaceful minions for a [[chaotic]] player at [[experience level]]s 28 to 30 via [[sacrifice]] or [[prayer]].

A pit fiend named Hilvuuloth appears among the assistants of [[One-eyed Sam (SLASH'EM)|One-eyed Sam]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], a pit fiend named Hilvuuloth is one of the assistants of [[One-eyed Sam (UnNetHack)|One-eyed Sam]], as with SLASH'EM.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], pit fiends are commander-rank demons that appear in various lairs all over Gehennom, and generate with huge [[trident]]s. The pit fiend's second weapon attack is replaced with a claw attack, and instead of a grabbing attack it has a spellcasting attack and a [[poisonous]] bite that reduces strength.

dNetHack adds a stronger variant in the [[Nessian pit fiend]], which also has a passive attack that deals fire damage to melee attackers - they are the second-strongest non-unique demons in the game. Nessian pit fiends generate with maces and battle-axes, and primarily appear in [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches/Nessus|Nessus]].

Eight pit fiends known as the Ashmadia (singular "Ashmade") accompany [[Asmodeus]] within his court alongside a Nessian pit fiend known as Asemadeva, the Ninth Ashmade; Asmodeus can also form pit fiends and other demons from his shed blood, although pit fiends will only appear once he has taken very heavy damage. A single "traitor" Nessian pit fiend also appears in the court of Demogorgon within [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches/Brine Flats#Demogorgon's palace|his palace]], and [[Mammon]] can take the form of a "green pit fiend".

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], pit fiends are instead given a single claw attack and a new pit-creation attack in order to "live up to their name".<ref>[https://github.com/tsadok/nhfourk/commit/17ac4d793fe848b7be91224587df2c5d56501950 NetHack Fourk commit 17ac4d7: "Make pit fiends live up to their name."]</ref> Fourk also adds more pit-based puns to the game's message output.

The pit fiend's new attack creates several pits around the target, always including one directly under them; if a square selected for pit creation already has one, it will become a [[hole]]. Most types of non-floor [[terrain]], dungeon features and some kinds of existing traps are exempt from pit creation. Among other things, this makes wielding [[footrice]] [[corpse]]s much more dangerous around pit fiends without [[levitation]] or [[flight]].

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], a different type of pit-creation attack inspired by Fourk is given to pit fiends, replacing their grabbing attack from vanilla.<ref>[https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack/commit/d027e7b307d7433721b469ebb1df8f531387d686 xNetHack commit d027e7b: "Give pit fiends a pit-creation attack"]</ref> The attack has them stomp the ground to create a pit right under you, then grab and throw you into it; if the attempt to create a pit fails (usually due to the square in question being ineligible), the pit fiend "looks rather piteous".

Preexisting pits may rarely turn into holes; while the attack only works on "normal" terrain types, preexisting traps generally do not block the attack. Levitating or flying does not block the attack either, but you will avoid any damage taken from the pit itself and immediately float out of it. 

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the pit fiend's base experience is also adjusted, and they now have a slightly higher speed of 9. Pit fiends in EvilHack can also stomp to create pits, with the implementation borrowed from xNetHack; said attack is adjusted to occur randomly 50% of the time, with the damage increased to 4d4.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/8a2d4cd476e3ffd87d41c83c34b61e6027524eb6 EvilHack commit 8a2d4cd: "Give pit fiends a pit-creation attack." ]</ref> 

The second-tier demon lord [[Mephistopheles]] has a pit fiend among his servants if he appears in [[Gehennom]].

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, the [[Undertaker quest]] in [[SlashTHEM]] has pit fiends as the second [[quest]] monster.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

Pit fiends are among the more powerful of devils, capable of
attacking twice with weapons as well as grabbing and crushing
