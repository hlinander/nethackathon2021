==Generation==
The Rat King only appears on [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Rat level|the rat level]], and [[Monster starting inventory|is always generated with a]] [[long sword]]. Oddly enough, despite being a [[unique monster]] with his own level, he does not have the G_NOGEN flag.

==Strategy==
Although all other {{white|r}} are tiny animals, the Rat King is medium-sized and able to use weapons, wands and scrolls. He can be quite dangerous to the unwary adventurer due to this, combined with his speed, HP and fairly hard-hitting weapon attacks.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Rat king (folklore)}}
{{wikipedia|The Nutcracker}}
In biology, a rat king refers to a group of rats that are accidentally knotted and sticked together at their tails and sometimes legs. It shares some similarities with siamese siblings, but as opposed to actual siamese twins, the rats are joined postnataly. Radiographical images show, that the tails of the joined rats had fractures in their tails which healed, implying the rats were alive in that state for a prolonged time.

The more literal Rat King as a large humanoid rat with a crown appears in various works of fiction. The most famous interpretation, is in the ballet ''The Nutcracker''.

== "Does not eat" attribute for odd monsters ==
Thank you for making non-eating monsters explicit. Perhaps we could have a "but see exceptions" tag below the "does not eat / eats corpses /..." because it currently says ghouls do not eat at all. (Gelatinous cubes, umber hulks should have the same problem.).

While we're at it, is it a lot of work to make "does not eat" text link to [[inediate]], carnivorous to itself etc? [[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 14:33, June 2, 2010 (UTC)
:The 'vore flag texts now link to the proper articles, but <tt>"does not eat (but see exceptions)"</tt> sounds a bit weird to me. --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 15:02, June 2, 2010 (UTC)
:I added a helpful notification when hovering mouse on a "(*)" that's after the "does not eat" --[[User:Paxed|paxed]] 15:35, June 2, 2010 (UTC)

== "is nasty" ==

Should we add a separate "can be summoned by [[summon nasties]]" attribute? It's technically not part of the monster definition, but it would probably help with the current confusion. (There could also be a "can '''not''' be summoned by summon nasties" reminder shown when a monster is [[M2_NASTY]], but not a summonable.)

I dislike the idea of just using "is [[M2_NASTY]]", but if that's necessary (see [[Talk:M2_NASTY]]), that would be another possibility, I guess. —[[User:bcode|bcode]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:bcode|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:EmailUser/Bcode|mail]]</sup> 18:39, 28 November 2012 (UTC)

:First of all, I don't have any good answers.  I'm just saying that I would likely still be confused if I hadn't been reading the current thread.  I should also point out that just because some readers might be confused doesn't necessarily mean that we need to make a change.  "can not be summoned" isn't terribly accurate after genocides have occurred, so it might be good to avoid that.  and if we're not going to write "can not be summoned", there's probably not much point to having a "can be summoned" attribute.  I don't know.  Are there any other suggestions? [[User:Derekt75|Derekt75]] ([[User talk:Derekt75|talk]]) 18:49, 28 November 2012 (UTC)

== SLITHY ==

Currently, the slithy trait is written as "has a serpent body". While indeed, most slithy monsters also have serpent bodies, other monsters, such as [[jellyfish]], do not. I am not sure if going through the talk page is really necessary, but here we go; I propope that the wording is changed to "has a slithy body".__[[User:Train|Train]] ([[User talk:Train|talk]]) 14:35, 13 April 2015 (UTC)}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', all [[Monsters (by size)|monsters are classified]] in six distinct sizes: Tiny &rarr; Small &rarr; Medium &rarr; Large &rarr; Huge &rarr; Gigantic<ref>http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/mon2-343.html</ref><ref>http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/VernonSpoilers/MonsterManual/contents.html</ref>. Each of these map to an integer used, for example, in determining [[monster carrying capacity|how much the monster can carry]]: Tiny = 0; Small = 1; Medium = 2; Large = 3; Huge = 4; Gigantic = 7.{{refsrc|monflag.h|163}} Some types of weapon distinguish between "small" monsters (tiny to medium) and "large" ones (large to gigantic). 

Only monsters medium or smaller can wear cloaks, and only exactly medium monsters can wear shirts or armor. Size also restricts which monsters can move diagonally through a crack. [[Statue]]s of tiny monsters cannot contain [[spellbook]]s; for details on the rest, see the [http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/misc-343.html#statues miscellaneous items spoiler].

Huge monsters cannot be [[engulf]]ed, while large ones can.

Huge monsters cannot fall through [[trap door]]s, though they can fall through [[hole]]s.

Size is only one component that is checked when determining if armor and other items can be worn. For example, non-humanoids will always break or slip out of torso armor, depending on their size, and even some medium-sized humanoids will break out of armor for shape reasons.  The code currently has two examples of this, the winged gargoyle and the marilith (wings and too many arms, respectively). One effect of this is that there is no armor-safe [[metallivore]] for polyself purposes.

If you are [[polymorph]]ed into a monster that never leaves a corpse, its size is used to scale your [[encumbrance|carrying capacity]].

[[Statue]]s can only be placed in [[container]]s if the monster they depict is medium or smaller.

== Adjusting NAO ==

I've been playing Nethack for a while and have recently started playing on NAO. I've messed around with it to get my desired options set, but my biggest issue is with the control scheme, where I have to use the number pad instead of the arrow keys. I figured that 'BIOS' or '!BIOS' would fix it, but it didn't work, and I'd prefer not to move around all of my keyboard buttons.

Any advice?

: There is an [[option]] called something like "number_pad=". Choose off if you are comfortable with VI-mode movement keys or do not have a separate number pad. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 20:22, December 28, 2009 (UTC)

== Message History ==

While watching other players on NAO, I've seen players pull up a message history that displays the previous dozen or so messages (such as dungeon sounds).  How do I do this?{{unsigned|66.135.144.108}}
:Control-P.  The unmodified game does not have this feature; it is one of many [[patch]]es that NAO uses.--[[User:Ray Chason|Ray Chason]] 10:46, January 1, 2010 (UTC)

:Look in [[Guidebook]] for options [[msg_window]] and [[msghistory]]. They set how old mesages are displayed when using {{kbd|Ctrl|p}}. I am not sure if unmodified game cannot do that too. --[[User:Stevko sk|Stevko sk]] 11:58, January 1, 2010 (UTC)

== SLASH'EM Compilation troubles: no executable generated ==

i did everything in the compile directions and got a license file ONLY in binary

OK so this is IMPOSSIBLE i keep getting so many random errors i am getting frustrated.
heres a better option can someone pre-patch slashem so that underground rivers and jedi patch is installed and then upload a zip of the resulting playable tty windows exe to uploading.com or megaupload.com or something and then post the link? I would like to compile this myself but it seems to be impossible. I wanted to make 2 new classes but I guess it will not be impossible unless compiling at least will give me consistant errors that I can search for.

OK null and void now!!!!!!!!!

so win32api.h was NOT in the include or the src folder and THAT was the problem so anyone who has trouble with compiling and knows NOTHING about it (like me) might find this post and ''copy the '''win32api.h''' file FROM (your directory)/sys/winnt TO both '''(your directory)/src''' AND '''(your directory)/include''' ''

and unless there are any other strange attacks against your compile you should get it
ALSO MOST IMPORTANT IT ''PUTS THE COMPILE INTO a folder called '''slam32d''' ''

lots of people are probably laughing and saying DUH repeatedly at this post but some people don't know this (like me) and keep checking their (your directory)/bin folder frowning and repeating the compile again and again. NOW I just have to try and find out where the spells are so I can change 2 of them (flame/ice sphere to shocking sphere/gas spore) and modify the flame and ice mages to be electric and air mages and Ill be good to go.

so another question.....

where are the files with the spells/spellbook types in them and also the character files for icemage and flamemage?

http://sharebee.com/0d5b42e9
for now i will test it




PLEASE DOES ANYONE KNOW?

where are the files with the spells/spellbook types in them and also the character files for icemage and flamemage?

== compiling errors please help ==

So I got a bunch of erroneous errors and so I thought hey... I'll recompile the original source to create the directory of slam32d with all the standard stuff in there (especially the dlls since mingw can't recreate them apparently) then I compiled from the altered and patched folder that I have been working on for about a month. Some things worked but others did not. I think I need to force recompile of the entire altered source.


with the install.bat it says mingw-make -f makefile.gcc (among the other stuff it needs in there) what switches do I use in place of -f (or) as well as -f to get it to totally remake the entire directory as if it's the first time (ie process ALL files in ALL directories)?

ok nevermind you just delete everything in the directory but leave the directory there (slam32d)


Then recompile and it will do everything again.

== Nethack html/php interface? ==

I was wondering what sort of technical difficulties there would be making a nethack html/php interface. I imagine the lag would be terriable, but surely that would be the hardest problem. I've also read that nethack doesn't give any feedback about the screen being refreshed. Anying hacking gurus out there thought about this?

==general pacifist advice==
Hi there, I'd like some advice on nethack :D

I'm trying to ascend a neutral pacifist gnomish healer, and I think i've got it well underway. However, due to a few complications, I'd like to ask a few questions on the matter.


Firstly, I've tried to do a protection racket before buying levels off the oracle. However, my archon just killed the minetown priest! What do i do now? Do i give up? The same applies for shopkeepers and price identification.

Secondly, I'm afraid that my archon will go rogue if it steps onto a level teleport trap (this occured before) or changes due to a polymorph trap! Should I still do mines end, where there is an overabundance of such traps? Or should I skip it and hope for a luckstone? Or do they have intrinsic magic resistance?

Thirdly, can you list the recommended equipment for an archon? I'm a bit worried about the lack of magic resistance. Will the archon be able to fight through hordes of monsters to the high altar? Or will I need some sort of backup plan? Will the monsters attack the archon and not I? Or should I bring conflict? Does stoning break the pacifist conduct?

Fourth, I need intrinsics. Should I go for crowning? Or should I just try and eat corpses?


And lastly, (thanks for your time), should I wish for a spellbook of charm monster/ another archon? Do i need them? Is there any reprecussions for doing so? And what equipment should I put on them?



Thanks again,

Osborn :D

: (in a hurry) There is a host of information available on [[pacifist]], [[Pet#Equipment_for_pets]], [[archon]], and [[talk:archon]]. Most of your questions are answered there. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 10:26, February 26, 2010 (UTC)

==Dagger skill for barbarians==
Hi,
I've read here that barbarians can only reach the 'Basic' level in dagger but looking at #enhance I see I already have the basic level and there is no '#' indicating it cannot be enhanced further (as it is the case for my bow skill). The bare handed combat skill is already at the Master level and there is no '#' neither. Can somebody explain why, please ?

Thanks,

== How do you pacify an angery priest? ==

For some reason the alter in MineTown was cross-alligned, so I converted it, took 2 tries but I did it, unfortunatly the preist got angery and killed me. -_- I tried chatting which would usualy donate, then I tried to just throw my gold at her, but then she killed me. So How would I calm her down in the future?

--DemonSlayerThe3 :: The Neutral Human Wizard
:The best solution is to simply not anger them in the first place. The minetown altar (any altar, actually. But this isn't a big problem if it isn't a temple) only has a 1 in 3 chance of being coaligned. If the minetown altar isn't co-aligned, then do not sacrifice on it. You can still use it to determine BUC, and you can still #chat to the priest for most of the services. If you need to sacrifice, then find another altar. If there are no other altars, than either kill the priest first (get reflection to avoid the lightning bolts) yourself or get a pet strong enough to do so. 
:You can pacify the priest using a scroll of taming, casting the Charm Monster spell, or using a magic harp. #chatting to the priest afterwards should make him angry again, so don't do that. I'm not sure if you'll be able to freely use the altar, but you probably can. -- [[User:Qazmlpok|Qazmlpok]] 03:49, March 7, 2010 (UTC)

== You are blasted by Magicbane's power! ==

I'm playing a wizard, got Magicbane through sacrifice, and this has started happening when I pick it up, recently. No idea why, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't happening the whole game through--either that or I'm incredibly oblivious. But I thought this never happened with sacrifice gifts. Anyway, the only difference is that I had it pulled from me by demons with bullwhips a couple of times and got it back. (That's what happened just now, when I first noticed this. But I haven't changed alignment (elf wizard, chaotic from the beginning), my God's not angry, Magicbane isn't cursed (is blessed, in fact), so I don't know what's going on. Any ideas?

== Taming Quest Nemeses ==

Is it possible to tame your quest nemesis? Namely, can a Knight use a magic trap (which are readily available) to tame Ixoth and use it as a mount? Could a Caveman kill the Chromatic Dragon, grab the quest items, revive it with a wand of undead turning and tame it as a pet? I'm thinking that the dragon would be especially useful because it is resistant to basically everything. --[[User:Aarnott|Aarnott]] 20:21, May 3, 2010 (UTC)
:All quest nemeses are [[covetous]] and therefore completely immune to taming, even from a magic trap. If you can manage to polymorph or slime a covetous monster, then they become tamable (with the exception of the Wizard of Yendor. Several other non-covetous creatures are completely immune to taming even if polymorphed as well), but all you have is the tame green slime/random non-special monster. The exception to this is SLASH'EM, where it is not only trivial to polymorph any non-magic resistant monster by polymorphing yourself into a genetic engineer, polymorphed monsters also revert to their original forms. Your quest nemesis will almost certainly be carrying the quest artifact, and many of them provide magic resistance and thus also polymorph resistance, however. Additionally, covetous monsters are damn near useless as pets, so pulling this off in SLASH'EM is mostly just to brag. -- [[User:Qazmlpok|Qazmlpok]] 21:59, May 3, 2010 (UTC)
::According to [http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/slashem/pets.html Eva Myers's tame monster spoiler], the Quest nemeses (along with Medusa and Rodney) are implacable enemies and can't even be made peaceful. Don't know if this applies to the SLASH'EM polymorph trick.

I'm playing NetHack using Vultures Eye. I have a Runed Dagger AND a Runed Bow, both refusing to be named. But, they have no names, and the bow can't be invoked.

== Wizard Starting with a 100% Failure Rate Spellbook? ==

So I started a wizard gnome, and I got a spellbook of Identify.  But it is a level 3 spell with 100% failure rate. Can anyone explain to me how to train spells to get better when you have 0% chance of getting them right?


I'm not wearing any armor or anything.
:Level up.  Spell failure rates are based on intelligence (or wisdom, for some classes), skill, and experience level.  Obviously you're not going to increase your skill level if you have a 100% failure rate, and increasing intelligence requires good luck with fountains or a potion of gain ability - you can't exercise that stat.  You may need to go up a few levels before you can usefully cast it though, possibly to level 5 or 7.  You could increase skill if you find a low-level [[divination]] spellbook, such as [[spellbook of light|light]] or [[spellbook of detect monsters|detect monsters]], which is actually not that unlikely in shops. -[[User:Ion frigate|Ion frigate]] 21:42, August 1, 2010 (UTC)

== Fix a broken lock? ==

I notice that when you force a lock with a weapon, it will break the lock, rendering it unusable. I have learned to wait until I have another way to open such things, but when I mistakenly tried to lock a broken lock, the game told me that I couldnt fix it with an uncursed lockpick. Can it be fixed with a blessed one then? Or do I need some other item? Or did the DevTeam just put that message there for the evulz?
:That message is somewhat misleading (maybe they were planning to implement manual lock fixing at some point?); the only way to fix a broken lock is with a wand of locking or a spell of wizard lock.  You're not really missing much, though.  AFAIK the only effect of a locked container is that troll corpses inside will not revive.  Monsters can't remove items from even unlocked containers, and gelatinous cubes just spit out the locks after dissolving the wood. --[[User:Darth l33t|Darth l33t]] 03:28, August 18, 2010 (UTC)

&&%s&& %s Monster starting inventory {149965 2023-02-14T17:31:07Z {4000114 Derekt75} /* Description */ Possibility of saddle in makemon() In ''[[NetHack]]'', certain types of [[monster]]s may be created with objects in their starting inventory appropriate to their species - a '''monster's starting inventory''' may also contain a random [[offensive item]], [[miscellaneous item]], and/or [[defensive item]].

The [[item]]s that [[spider]]s and [[snake]]s are generated with during initial level creation are not part of their starting inventory, as they are created for the monsters to [[hide]] under.

==Description==
Monster starting inventory is distributed to each applicable monster at level creation, as well as each time a new monster is created.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|576|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Monsters generated in [[bones]] files will have whatever inventory they were carrying at the time of its creation; monsters created by [[reverse genocide]] always have empty starting inventories.

A [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/e34120648c374754 pretty comprehensive spoiler] can be found [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/e34120648c374754 here]. 

===Weapons===
A [[humanoid]] monster that has a weapon attack and the ability to wield weapons, is not being generated on the [[Rogue level]], and does not have any rulessets governing its starting inventory can be generated with one of the following five weapon sets, with an equal probability of each:{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|512|version=NetHack 3.6.6|name="default"|common=Default set of cases for monster weapon generation}}

{|class="wikitable"
!strong!!not strong
|-
|[[battle-axe]]||3-14 [[dart]]s
|-
|[[two-handed sword]]||[[crossbow]], 3-14 [[bolt]]s
|-
|colspan=2|[[bow]], 3-14 [[arrow]]s
|-
|[[long sword]]||3-5 [[dagger]]s
|-
|[[lucern hammer]]||[[aklys]]
|}

The size of the die used in rolling for these weapons is determined by whether or not the monster is also a [[M2_LORD|lord]] to its kind, an [[M2_PRINCE|overlord]] to its kind, or is [[nasty]]; this is governed by the equation {{sfrac|5|14 - ''N''}}, where ''N'' is the result of a "bias" variable that is incremented for each applicable property - 1 if the monster is a lord, 1 if the monster is nasty, and 2 if the monster is an overlord - and then multiplied by two:<ref name="default"/>

* A normal monster uses a d14. ({{frac|5|14}} ≈ 35.71%)
* Monsters that are either nasty or lords to their kind use a d12. ({{frac|5|12}} ≈ 41.67%)
* Monsters that are both nasty and a lord to their kind, or else are an overlord to their kind, use a d10. ({{frac|5|10}} = 50%)
* Monsters that are both nasty and an overlord to their kind use a d8. ({{frac|5|8}} = 62.5%)

{{todo|List the species-specific rules for monster weapons. If this would be too long, maybe pare it down to the "important" ones.}}

===Armor===
In addition to any other items, monsters can also get armor. This includes all [[mercenaries]] - members of the [[Yendorian army]], [[guard]]s, [[watchmen]], [[watch captain]]s - and [[Mummy|mummies]]. 

For mercenaries, armor items spawned are based on a complex mechanism to approximate the target AC of the given creature:
{| border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="20"
|
* ([[Crystal plate mail|crystal]]) [[plate mail]]
* [[splint mail]]
* [[banded mail]]
* [[ring mail]]

|
* [[helmet]]
* [[dented pot]]
* [[small shield]]
* [[large shield]]
|
* [[low boots]]
* [[high boots]]
* [[leather gloves]]
* [[leather cloak]]
|}
For mummies, there is a unique {{frac|6|7}} chance for a generated mummy to have a [[mummy wrapping]].

===Saddle===

Ponies, Horses, and Warhorses have a 1% chance of being generated saddled.

==Death drops==
{{main|Death drop}}
Monsters killed by the player will drop their inventory, along with random objects that are generated upon their death. Some monsters also leave behind certain non-random body parts, such as [[unicorn horn]]s or [[dragon scales]].

Monster starting inventory can provide valuable hints at the true [[identification|identities]] of objects with [[randomized appearance]]s.

A '''genetic engineer''', {{monsym|genetic engineer}}, is a type of [[monster]] that originates in [[SLASH'EM]], and also appears in [[SlashTHEM]] and [[xNetHack]]. Its sole melee attack is weak, but can [[polymorph]] any monster it hits unless the target has [[magic resistance]] or sufficient [[magic cancellation]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Genetic engineers now appear in NetHack 3.7. They can generate outside of Gehennom and are eligible to appear via the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]]. Genetic engineers will [[teleport]] away if possible after changing a monster with their polymorph attack; this includes [[you]] if you are polymorphed into a genetic engineer.

Eating a genetic engineer corpse will cause you to polymorph as a [[chameleon]] or [[doppelganger]] corpse does - this also applies to [[pet]]s and other monster, but pets will not eat corpses that would cause them to polymorph unless they are starving or on the verge of untaming.

If you are hit by the polymorph attack as a [[werecreature]], it will switch you between your natural and beast forms.

The current tile image is from SLASH'EM; vanilla uses a different tile (no glasses, holding a strand of DNA) which should probably replace it.}}

{{todo|Write up info for other variants}}

==Strategy==
The genetic engineer is generally a dangerous opponent, since it can easily polymorph you into a form that breaks armor or else shrinks out of it - this in turn will usually leave you susceptible to being polymorphed further, since you will not have any magic cancellation. Fortunately, they are typically only encountered around [[Gehennom]], and you should have a source of magic resistance before then. Players without magic resistance should use their best ranged attacks to kill off a genetic engineer before they can get into melee range.

Do not use [[conflict]] around genetic engineers if at all possible: monsters in SLASH'EM revert to their original form if killed while polymorphed, effectively giving them an "extra life". This causes fights to drag out longer than necessary even in best-case scenarios, and as with other instances of monsters polymorphing this may create highly-resistant monster forms such as the magic-resistant [[crystal golem]]. While the attack is subject to [[enchantment resistance]] against other monsters, this should not be relied upon for conflict-based strategies. Players seeking to use conflict should prioritize killing any genetic engineers nearby first. 

===As a polyform===
The genetic engineer also represents an interesting strategy for players that use [[polyself]] often: their polymorph attack triggers whether or not you are fighting with [[bare hands]] in that form, and ignores [[magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance scores]] against monsters, allowing you to bypass or even tame numerous monsters that are either very formidable enemies (e.g. [[Archon]]s and [[giant shoggoth]]s) or very difficult to tame (e.g. [[Planetar and Solar]]). This also allows you to tame monsters for which taming is normally impossible - for example, this is the only way to tame Death in SLASH'EM that preserves his current form, as opposed to [[sliming]] him and taming the resulting [[green slime]].

[[Gray dragon]]s and other monsters with player-style magic resistance are completely immune, while monsters with armor that provides magic cancellation can prevent your attack from working immediately. [[Shopkeeper]]s, [[aligned priest]]s, and hostile [[minion]]s can never be tamed, even if polymorphed. In addition, the effect is also subject to enchantment resistance, meaning that it will not work unless you are wielding a weapon of the appropriate enchantment to hit that monster with.

Otherwise, the genetic engineer form is not very strong; many monsters are capable of killing you and revert you to normal before you get a chance to polymorph them, particularly if you are surrounded. As noted above, there is also the ever-present risk of creating a stronger monster that you cannot defeat. Furthermore, hitting a monster and polymorphing it into a form with passive attacks will cause the new form's attacks to trigger rather than any the old monster - if you are trying to polymorph a monster, be sure to wear [[gloves]] to prevent [[YASD]] in case that monster becomes a [[cockatrice]], [[asphynx]], [[basilisk]], or a similar monster.

Doctor Frankenstein appears in [[SLASH'EM]] along with [[Frankenstein's Monster|his monster]] on [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Frankenstein's Lab|his level]] in Gehennom.  His attacks can cause [[teleport]] in the manner of a [[quantum mechanic]]. He is guaranteed to carry a [[lab coat]], a [[wand of polymorph]], and a [[spellbook of polymorph]].

==Strategy==
Somewhat like the [[Vlad the Impaler|other denizen of a second up staircase in Gehennom]], Doctor Frankenstein is quite weak for the part of the game in which one meets him.  He does a non-threatening amount of physical damage, and his special attack is merely an annoyance, which is mostly nullified by [[magic cancellation]] anyway.  He is somewhat hard to hit, but no more so than a [[disenchanter]].

'''Spark bugs''', '''arc bugs''', and '''lightning bugs''', collectively referred to as '''electric bugs''', are monsters in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SpliceHack]]. They possess the same shock attacks as [[grid bug]]s, but since they are higher than level 0, their attacks have the potential to destroy rings and wands. In SpliceHack, they can only move orthogonally like grid bugs, but in SLASH'EM they can move diagonally as well.

==Strategy==
All three of these bugs can be a large danger to an early SLASH'EM character.  [[Magic cancellation]] is a must to protect against their attacks, but even MC 3 is not proof against them, and it may be difficult to acquire for a beginning character. The main danger of these bugs is that they may destroy wands; in SLASH'EM, a wand exploding has the same effect as if you [[breaking wands|broke it yourself]]. This means that all those wands you have could cause magical explosions, [[wand of cancellation|cancel everything in your inventory]], [[wand of fire|engulf you in a fireball]], or [[wand of polymorph|polymorph you]]; worst of all, a [[wand of wishing]] could be wasted entirely.  A relatively low-level character is not likely to survive that many magical explosions, and these bugs are generally seen in SLASH'EM's relatively early game.  They make acquiring a sack or oilskin sack a much higher priority, particularly for wands of cancellation, which cannot be put in a bag of holding. A good philosophy in SLASH'EM for wands is, unless you wouldn't mind it blowing up in your face, don't keep it in your main inventory.

A water hulk is a slightly stronger counterpart to the [[umber hulk]], and only found in [[SLASH'EM]].  The only differences between them are that the water hulk has a higher base level (11 instead of 9), can swim, and is generated only in [[Gehennom]].

A wight is a more powerful counterpart to the [[barrow wight]] in SLASH'EM.  With two drain life attacks, it can be deadly to a character without high [[magic cancellation]] or [[drain resistance]].  Luckily, they tend not to appear before the player has MC 3, and thus are not a huge threat, as MC 3 more or less renders their drain life attacks harmless.

===Generation===
Vecna is always found within the largest room in the Chaotic Quest's room-and-corridors map. He is the [[Chaotic Quest]] nemesis, guarding the [[Key of Chaos]], and will drop the Key and the Hand of Vecna upon his defeat, unless destroyed in a way that would not have left a corpse.

===Strategy===
Although he is the second-highest level spellcaster in SLASH'EM, Vecna is less difficult than that status may imply - he is somewhat slow at 9 speed, and has only two attacks per turn of his: a powerful cold touch and a single spellcasting attack. However, he does [[Need +x weapon to hit|require a +4 or better weapon]] in order for you to even deal damage, and his high base level lends some serious power to his spells, particularly his [[psi bolt]]s.

His main weakness is not any particular set of traits, but a constraint imposed by his location: the Chaotic Quest entrance is a portal rather than a staircase, and Vecna is [[covetous]]. Vecna will therefore readily warp to you, but will not teleport away to heal. Vecna respects [[Elbereth]], and a permanent engraving alongside a well-enchanted weapon can potentially trivialize matters - even more so if you have [[cold resistance]], [[drain resistance]] and/or [[magic resistance]]. However, the branch and its denizens are still quite difficult, as is Vecna himself, and unless you take appropriate measures (including obtaining additional resistances) he is unlikely to face you by himself.

Vecna and other spellcasters within the level, such as the more-evasive liches, can and will [[summon nasties]] including Elbereth-ignoring [[minotaur]]s or [[couatl]] to surround you with if given the opportunity - Vecna himself can cast the spell at a higher base level than even an arch-lich. Additionally, the random {{mcsl|V}} that generate upon the level's creation can include [[vampire mage]]s, who are vicious nasty-summoning spellcasters in their own right, or even [[fire vampire]]s that can tear through a character lacking [[fire resistance]] with their alarming speed and abundant hit die. This will almost necessitate drain resistance, which thankfully has more sources in SLASH'EM. On top of it all, you may want a source of [[reflection]] to deal with other potential summons, as well as a means of [[levitation]] or [[water walking]] to survive or avoid a potential drowning attempt thanks to the [[create pool]] spell.

Like most other monsters, Vecna may receive a [[wand of teleportation]] upon generation; if so, he will use it to try and evade you like any other intelligent monster, which may allow him to heal in line with more typical covetous behavior. Wands in SLASH'EM and its variants also possess more charges on average compared to vanilla - if you cannot dispatch him quickly, it may be worth it to double back later, especially if you lack a means to destroy or steal the wand. He may also have a [[scroll of teleportation]] on hand; this is especially aggravating if the scroll is cursed, and also makes for potentially disastrous corner cases where you can confuse him before he gets the chance to read it (e.g. with [[Magicbane]]) - in either case, you will then have to track him down throughout the main dungeon.

While the branch (and by extension Vecna) is entirely optional since you only need two of three alignment keys, the Hand of Vecna is a quality artifact that may well be worth the trouble: it is a semi-guaranteed source of hungerless [[regeneration]] and [[half physical damage]] (both rare intrinsics on their own), and may even serve as a wielded source of drain resistance in a pinch.

===Generation===
In EvilHack, Vecna is found on the last floor of [[Vecna's Domain|his own domain]], meditating on a [[throne]] in the deepest room of his lair. Vecna will always generate with a ring of [[slow digestion]] and wears a cursed, [[erosion|eroded]] [[robe]] of drain resistance.

===Strategy===
Vecna is an even more vicious adversary in this variant, with two powerful touch attacks, a death gaze, and two spellcasting attacks per round. One is a powerful touch of cold that is standard for liches, while the other induces withering similar to [[mummy|mummies]].

[[The Sword of Kas]] is often a vital part of most players' kits for dealing with Vecna, due to [[Kas]] himself residing on the previous floor; said [[artifact weapon]] can provide a very useful means of offense for a player that excels in [[two-handed sword]]s or otherwise lacks options, as any damage it deals against Vecna is tripled. However, [[lawful]] characters take alignment penalties for using poisoned weapons, while [[Priest]]s of any kind suffer a -30 to-hit penalty from trying to use it, on top of potentially [[anger]]ing their [[god]]. Alignment penalties in EvilHack also weigh far more heavily against the player's fortunes, especially if they have not yet completed their [[Quest]].

The robe of drain resistance Vecna generates with is likely to be very useful for those seeking aid in maintaining casting power while in [[Gehennom]], making it a valuable asset for inevitable later fights against wraiths and vampires (including [[Vlad the Impaler]] and his [[Lifestealer]]).

===Encyclopedia entry===
{{encyclopedia|
	Vecna's early life was clouded in legend and contradiction.
	Most accounts stated that he was originally a human wizard
	from Oerth, although some reports claimed that he was a half-elf.
	After having become an extremely powerful wizard and starting to
	fear for his own mortality, Vecna was taught by Orcus how to
	achieve undeath, later becoming one of the most powerful liches
	ever in existence.

	During his reign, Vecna trusted his lieutenant Kas with most
	administrative tasks.  He forged the powerful Sword of Kas as an
	instrument of his lieutenant's authority.  However, Vecna's evil,
	manifested in the sword, seduced Kas into usurping and killing his
	master.

==History==
In NetHack Plus, he was known as '''Master Vecna''', and acted as the [[Undead Slayer]] [[quest nemesis]]. Master Vecna's base level was 25, and his melee attack did only 3d6 damage; he still had enchantment resistance to weapons below +4.

Vecna was made into a unique boss lich starting with [[SLASH 6]], presiding over his own lich-populated [[special level]] similar to other monsters such as the [[Rat King]] and [[Grund the Orc King]]. In this game, killing Vecna produces either the Hand of Vecna or the Eye of Vecna, with a 50% chance of each.

Vecna was first introduced to EvilHack in version 0.7.0 as part of three commits that added Vecna's Domain as a new branch.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/59f3575fb1130f3cf051663f81bc851106f4a928 EvilHack commit 59f3575 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part one)."]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/f0d135255a6060adbe82a095efdcfc402218866e EvilHack commit f0d1352 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part two) - artifacts, Kas (unique monster)."]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/919cd959f737dd6791411dfda7e93c0ddb1c6756 EvilHack commit 919cd95 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part three) - levels, minor tweaks."]</ref>

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Vecna}}
Vecna is an original creation of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where he originally was a background figure that became popular enough to feature as a major antagonist. He is named for fantasy author [[Jack Vance]], who among other achievements developed the "fire-and-forget" magic system that would come to be used in ''D&D'' and many other fantasy works.

Vecna was first mentioned in the third supplement to Gary Gygax's original ''Dungeons & Dragons'', where the Hand and Eye of Vecna were introduced by its co-author [[wikipedia:Brian Blume|Brian Blume]] as the only remnants of a long-destroyed evil lich. The only other fact known about Vecna at the time was that Kas was his bodyguard, and no details of the artifacts were ever revealed to Gygax; the descriptions of the artifacts in the 2nd edition's ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' released in 1989 further expanded on his history, before he finally appeared in person within the 1990 adventure ''Vecna Lives!'', where he was revealed to be a demigod and the chief antagonist. Among the various details of his life, the ''Greyhawk'' setting reveals that Kas had ultimately turned traitor and brought about Vecna's (temporary) downfall.

At some point, Vecna had either created or procured The Sword of Kas for his most trusted lieutenant, depending on the edition; details of Kas's service to Vecna and subsequent betrayal likewise vary. What remains consistent across tellings is that Kas used the sword against his former master in a pitched battle that left neither standing: Vecna was destroyed save for his hand and left eye, and Kas had been flung into faraway planes, with the Sword, Hand and Eye as the only remaining objects in the area after the fight.

During the various editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', Vecna has served as a lesser deity with dominion over the undead; he has also appeared as a god of secrets. It has been suggested that the Hand and Eye were inspired by similar items from the ''Eternal Champion'' series of works by [[Michael Moorcock]] (specifically, the Hand of Kwll and the Eye of Rhynn). Vecna also took the half-demon child known as [[Acererak]] under his tutelage, leading to Acererak himself becoming a powerful lich in his own right.

==Other variants==
===dNetHack===
Vecna's stats can be found in the code of [[dNetHack]], making him a [[deferred]] monster. According to [[User:Chris|one of the developers]], Vecna would have served as the boss of [[The Lost Tomb]], but plans for this were tabled; however, there is still a chance that he may be implemented in a future version.

They are all characterized by strong physical attacks, high [[speed]], and clerical [[spellcasting]], similar to [[aligned priest|aligned priests]]. They are most often encountered as minions, either given to lawful characters through [[prayer]]{{refsrc|pray.c|1203|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} or [[sacrifice]],{{refsrc|pray.c|1167|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} or created when attempting to convert a lawful altar. As minions, they are quite powerful, and can be a useful source of [[shield of reflection|shields of reflection]] or even [[artifact weapon]]s ([[Sunsword]] and [[Demonbane]]), which they have a chance of [[Monster starting inventory|starting with]].

The movanic deva is the weakest of the devas.  It is still a formidable opponent, particularly if one lacks [[fire resistance]], as its attacks will then burn you.  It is able to cast clerical spells, including possibly [[curse items]] and [[summon insects]].

Monadic devas are slightly stronger than movanic devas, and are distinctive in that their physical attacks do only normal damage.  Still, they are quite formidable opponents, similar in level to an [[Angel]] but much faster.  They are also able to cast all clerical spells, including fire pillar (same effect as a [[scroll of fire]]) and geyser.

The toughest of the devas, astral devas are almost equivalent to an [[Archon]] in difficulty.  They do similar amounts of physical damage, and while the astral deva cannot stun and blind with its gaze, it can stun with its physical attacks.  The astral deva is also slightly faster than the Archon, with a speed of 18 over the Archon's 16.  They are almost the same base level (18 for the astral deva versus 19 for the Archon), and are both spellcasters.  Luckily, the astral deva is unable to [[summon nasties]], as it can only cast clerical spells, which summon nasties fortunately is not.  It can, however, [[summon insects]], which is somewhat dangerous given some of [[SLASH'EM]]'s new insects, such as the [[assassin bug]] or [[killer beetle]].
{{Clear}}

===Strategy===
The devas, with the [[Planetar]]s and [[Solar]]s, constitute one of the chief reasons that lawful [[alignment]] is very nice in SLASH'EM.  Not only are these dangerous monsters always peaceful to you, but you have a very good chance of receiving a number of them as pets, both from [[altar]]s and occasionally from praying while in trouble. Additionally, receiving them as minions from sacrificing does not increase your prayer timeout, and so does not even require that much time or nutrition.

If you are not lawful, these are all formidable opponents. It should be noted that, "in the wild", these monsters are all quite rarely seen, particularly since they cannot appear in [[Gehennom]] and are relatively high-level. However, one should think twice about converting lawful altars in SLASH'EM. It is better to convert altars at lower experience levels, since then easier [[couatl]]s and [[Aleax]]es will be created instead of devas. It is best, in fact, to convert altars below experience level 4, since then no [[minion]]s will be created.

In combat, it is good to keep in mind that devas are not guaranteed a [[shield of reflection]], unlike Archons, although they do have a reasonable chance of having one. They all resist [[death ray]]s, but no other types of damage. Thus, attack wands work well against them, although their high [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]] of 90 means that wands of {{of|wand|sleep|striking|and=1|magic missile}} are likely to be ineffective. If they do have a shield of reflection, wands of draining and wands of fireball are good choices against them, since they resist neither and neither can be reflected. [[Stoning]] is also a good choice if it is available; since they do not [[summon nasties]], however, a cockatrice corpse is less likely to be around. Escape items, in particular [[wand of teleportation|wands]] or [[scroll of teleportation|scrolls]] of teleportation, are recommended as a back-up plan, in light of their high speed and the fact that they will follow you from level to level if adjacent to you.

====As pets====
Devas can make very powerful pets. They are very fast, can heal themselves, don't eat, and unlike the most powerful pets ([[Solar]]s and [[giant shoggoth]]s), are medium-sized and can thus wear armor and cloaks. This can be particularly useful to a pacifist character, as it is much easier to give devas magic resistance, either with a [[cloak of magic resistance]] or [[gray dragon scale mail]]. Contrast this to large monsters, which can only gain extrinsic magic resistance by wielding [[Magicbane]]. Devas can thus gain immunity to [[polymorph trap]]s, making them much more reliable pets. Also, an astral deva wearing a fully-enchanted set of armor will have an AC of around &minus;59, about the best achievable for any monster. Still, an astral deva can only reach level 27 without potions of gain level; while it will be powerful and difficult to kill, it still will not engage the tougher monsters in SLASH'EM without [[conflict]].

While useful, devas gained as minions through sacrifice or prayer cannot pick up or use any items other than the ones they start with. In particular, this means that disarming one (perhaps because it is carrying [[Sunsword]]) will disarm it permanently, somewhat decreasing its damage potential, and making it unable to attack petrifying monsters at all. However, for lawfuls, it is possible to gain large numbers of these minions, who in combination with a [[magic whistle]] can be very useful.

==dNetHack==

In [[dNetHack]], '''Devas''' are the most common type of neutral angel. As with most other angelic monsters, Devas will only be generated in the [[End Game|Planes]], or as minions for altars when attempting to convert.
