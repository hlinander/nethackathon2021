The [[weapon practice]] [[technique]] is an early Undead Slayer's best friend, and can quickly bring you up to skilled in dagger - firearms is also a good target, as it lets you save precious bullets for actual use. Reaching skilled in any weapon also lets you learn the [[disarm]] technique, which can supplement or even replace the [[bullwhip]]'s ability to disarm depending on your [[dexterity]]. [[Drow]] Undead Slayers can utilize bare-handed combat to put foes to [[sleep]], and Slayers can reach Grand Master skill with them, making them an effective role-race combo for taking out various high-level foes.

Slayers that survive the early game will find their starting intrinsics a powerful boon against the [[wand of draining]] and various other level-draining threats - [[wraith]]s can be more comfortably disposed of, while [[vampire]]s can be thwarted with the wooden stake and any silver weapons you have available. The Undead Slayer's quest artifact, [[the Stake of Van Helsing]], is a formidable late-game weapon due to its +5 to-hit and +12 bonus damage, and it provides valuable slotless [[magic resistance]].

In the late game, Undead Slayers will appreciate the ability to take on demon princes such as [[Juiblex]] and [[Demogorgon]] without fearing their illness-inducing attacks (though Demogorgon is still a threat outside of this). However, they will also want a secondary source of magic resistance, as the [[Wizard of Yendor]] can steal their quest artifact from them. Intrinsic drain resistance also frees up valuable armor and amulet slots for an Undead Slayer's [[ascension kit]].

==Origin==
Some of the iconography of the Undead Slayer derives from the ''Castlevania'' game series; like the Belmont clan members, you start with a bullwhip, chain mail, daggers, and holy water. Other parts, such as the crossbow{{refsrc|u_init.c|212|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} and the ability to reach Grand Master in bare-handed combat{{refsrc|u_init.c|720|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} derive from ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''.

The '''Yeoman''' is a [[role]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. Yeomen are based primarily around the Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London, and are melee-focused combatants similar to [[Knight]]s, with more skill in riding and polearm use. Yeomen must be generated male and lawful, and may be [[Human (starting race)|humans]], [[Elf (starting race)|elves]] or [[Hobbit (starting race)|hobbits]]. According to the guidebook:

 Yeomen are sturdy fighters. They are famed for their ability to stand doing nothing for hours. It is said that this is because they  are  none  too bright. Yeomen can both take a lot of damage and inflict it on others.

== Starting Inventory ==

* a +2 [[short sword]]
* a +1 [[partisan]]
* +1 [[leather armor]]
* +0 [[high boots]]
* +0 [[leather gloves]]
* 10-20 [[apple]]s
* 10-20 [[carrot]]s
* 3 uncursed [[potions of water]]
* a [[fishing pole]]

A Yeoman's starting pet is always a [[saddle]]d [[pony]].

== Abilities ==

Yeomen can identify all non-magical weapons and armor from the beginning. Yeomen begin the game with the [[calm steed]] technique, which does nothing likely due to a bug.<!--Does it work in SlashTHEM?-->

Yeomen also start the game with intrinsically slow [[speed]], making 4 moves for every 5 units of time.

*At experience level 7 Yeomen gain intrinsic [[speed]].
*At experience level 15 Yeomen gain the intrinsic ability to [[swim]].

== Yeomen vs. Knights ==

There are quite a few similarities between Yeomen and Knights. Both can become expert riders, and start with a saddled pony. Both start with apples and carrots to keep their ponies fed and to train apport. Yeomen cannot intrinsically jump, but can easily gain that ability with boots, without being restricted to a knights move. Yeomen get the [[calm steed]] [[technique]], but miss out on the healing hands and turn undead. Yeomen can become expert at polearms, but only skilled at lance, where it is the opposite for Knights. Another similarity is their quest artifact, the [[Crown of Saint Edward]] is a Lawful Helm of telepathy, it confers magic resistance and half spell damage when carried. The Knight's [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]] also confers magic resistance and telepathy, and doubles some spell damage.

== Polearms (and [[Reaper]]) ==

Yeomen are the only class that can gain expert at polearms. Like lances, you can use a polearm in melee normally without bashing while mounted. Unlike lances, you cannot joust an enemy with a polearm. However, polearms have a few distinct advantages over lances. They will not break like lances can on an unlucky joust. They are much more common. They are lighter, ranging from ranseurs and spetums weighing 50 to halberds and lucern hammers at 150. Lances weigh 180. The better polearms do more damage, and though your starting partisan is the weakest in the category, its average damage is equal to the knight's starting lance.
*Lances do 1d6 vs small and 1d8 vs large or 3.5 to 4.5 on average.
*Halberds do 1d10 vs small and 2d6 vs large or 5.5 to 7 on average.

There are no artifact lances, but the Yeoman's second sacrifice gift is the fantastic lawful halberd [[Reaper]] which has +5 to hit and +20 to damage when pounding and in melee while riding. Pounding a large monster with Reaper while mounted gives an average base damage of 27, with a follow-up melee for another 27. That is an ''average'' damage of 54 points before most monsters can hit once, and before enchantment and skill bonuses. The same scenario with a lance would pound at 4.5, and joust (20-80% of the time) for 16 for a total of 20.5 points. If you have jump boots, and a light source you can do massive damage just pounding with Reaper, without the risk of breakage, or the chance of not jousting, and the +5 to hit means you will rarely miss.

== Swords ==

Although you start with a pretty well enchanted +2 short sword, and can gain expert in the skill, if you can find a longsword, you should consider switching. Yeomen can become skilled at longsword have relatively easy access to [[Excalibur]]. The first sacrifice gift for Yeomen is the very good [[Sword of Justice]], a longsword with +5 to hit and +12 to damage against neutral and chaotic monsters. Since Yeomen can become skilled at two weapon, and in Slash'em you can [[#twoweapon]] with two artifacts, Excalibur and Sword of Justice are a very effective combination.

If you are skilled at #twoweapon and skilled at longsword, and are wielding both the +7 Excalibur and +7 Sword of Justice, you will do more damage per hit than with an Expert +7 Reaper. You will also get drain resistance and searching, but there are disadvantages to carrying Excalibur, particularly in Gehennom, and Sword of Justice is less effective in the Astral Plane. There are fewer keystrokes involved in just slashing away at monsters than applying a polearm, jumping and applying again, so lazy Yeomen will prefer this strategy.

Note that hobbit Yeomen cannot #twoweapon at all, so advancing longsword is less attractive.

== The early game ==

The early game can be difficult with your intrinsic slowness, but can become quite a strong fighter very quickly if played well. Your initial focus should be on helping your pony to grow into a [[warhorse]] and improving your skill with [[polearm]]s. A good strategy is to repeatedly engrave Elbereth in the dust and chop away at foes by applying your partisan at range. Other strategies to improve polearm skill include moving so as to keep your horse between you and your foe, picking up an item in a shop and attacking over the [[shopkeeper]]'s head, and attacking with it in melee while mounted. The last strategy should be delayed until you have enough HP to survive a failed mounting attempt (at least 20). You will get speed at level 7, and by the time your pony grows up it will let you move faster than even a pair of [[speed boots]].

Your starting +2 [[short sword]] will help you hit foes and gain your first few levels, but it's not worth trying to advance short sword skill in light of the other powerful weapons you will soon have access to; focus on polearm instead. You may want to collect a stack of daggers in the mines to use for ranged fighting, but these are heavy and burdening an already slow player is particularly dangerous. If your horse grows up into a [[warhorse]] pounding with your polearm while mounted is probably a better strategy. If you find an early [[long sword]], begin training with it as soon as possible. Once you get to level 5, you can begin to dip for [[Excalibur]], which is somewhat safer in SLASH'EM as [[water moccasin]]s don't have an instakill attack anymore (but are still tough foes in the early game). The [[Rat King]] has a longsword, but is not always generated. Watching your horse fight a [[watch captain]] will reveal what weapon he carries, and if it's a long sword, you may try to [[disarm]] him (and then be ready to run!) In the worst case, you will eventually get one from a [[barrow wight]] or from the quest. When you find an altar, you will also be able to sacrifice for the [[Sword of Justice]] (your guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]]), one of the best lawful artifacts in the game. Two-weaponing with the [[Sword of Justice]] and [[Excalibur]] makes for a potent offense.

You should trade up for a better polearm if you come across one. Spetums are a favorite because they are light and do a good deal of damage. Bardiches and halberds are upgrades in damage, but are heavier. Any other unenchanted polearm would be a downgrade from your +1 partisan, or at best a wash. Once you find an altar, do keep sacrificing until you get [[Reaper]] (your guaranteed second [[sacrifice gift]]), at which point the game will suddenly become much easier.

You should also try to find a [[skeleton key]], [[lockpick]] or [[credit card]] (check the [[Minetown]] shops, the mall, or kill a [[plastic golem]]), so you don't have to dismount to open locked doors. An axe or pickaxe will do in a pinch as well.

== The midgame ==
The Yeoman's midgame is straightforward and not overly difficult. Try to get a source of [[reflection]] and [[magic resistance]]; the latter is especially critical as losing your warhorse to a polymorph trap will make you much slower. As with most SLASH'EM roles, you should make for the [[Black Market]] as soon as you finish [[Sokoban]] (or possibly after getting the [[luckstone]] from [[Mine's End]]) and before doing any of the dangerous SLASH'EM dungeon branches. If you plan to kill Sam for his ascension gear, hold off on buying protection until after you have done so.

=== Yeoman quest ===
{{main|Yeoman quest}}
Once you are sufficiently strong in melee and well-armored, you should complete the Yeoman quest. [[Colonel Blood]] hits hard, but is not an overly tough foe, and the [[Crown of Saint Edward]] will give you both [[magic resistance]] and [[half spell damage]], as well as extrinsic [[telepathy]]. You will also find plenty of bullets and firearms from the soldiers on the quest, as well as a guaranteed long sword and co-aligned altar. Pick up bullets whenever you see them, as exploding grenades will destroy them if they are lying about or in a soldier's inventory.

== The late game ==

In the late game, a good scenario to aspire to is:
*Expert at riding, riding a ki-rin with a blessed saddle (worth a wish to get a blessed figurine of a ki-rin)
*Expert at polearms, wielding the blessed rustproof +7 Reaper (or two-weaponing with [[Excalibur]] and another powerful artifact such as [[Grayswandir]], [[Frost Brand]], [[Fire Brand]], or [[Sword of Justice]])
*Wearing blessed +5 fixed gauntlets of dexterity (This is a nice boost to AC for every SLASH'EM character)
*Wearing blessed +5 fixed jumping boots (speed boots don't enhance speed while riding, but jumping does work)
*A lit blessed magic lamp or magic candle. Although the candle is preferable (lighter and no chance of giving a wish), having a permanent source of light is more important than an 80% chance of one wish while using Reaper, and required for jumping and pounding in dark places. There will always be a magic lamp you can swim for in the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Sunless Sea|Sunless Sea]].
*the rest of a standard [[Ascension kit]]

It is also worth sacrificing for [[minion]]s at higher levels, as a Yeoman has access to powerful [[deva]]s, and eventually mega-powerful [[Archon]]s, [[Planetar]]s, and [[Solar]]s. With your full ascension kit, your fast flying steed, and your powerful retinue, you can head into the end-game as a nearly unstoppable tank and have a very satisfying experience.

&&%s&& %s Exercise {149807 2023-01-22T15:51:49Z {187 Darth l33t} /* How to exercise */ more practical methods : ''"Abuse" redirects here. For pet abuse, see [[Tameness#Abuse|Tameness § Abuse]].''

In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''exercise''' refers to gradually increasing your [[attribute]]s over time by repeating certain actions while avoiding performing others.

==Description==
Exercising an attribute has a chance of (18 &minus; current attribute value) in 19 of incrementing the attribute's ''exercise counter'', whose maximum value is 50.{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|426|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|410|nethack=3.6.6}} The "current attribute value" also includes modifiers from items - one relevant example is that wearing [[gauntlets of power]] has a side-effect of completely preventing strength from being exercised.

You can only exercise four of the six attributes: [[strength]], [[dexterity]], [[constitution]], and [[wisdom]] - there is no way to exercise [[intelligence]] or [[charisma]], though they can be increased by other means, e.g. a [[potion of gain ability]].

===How to exercise===
Here are examples of how to efficiently exercise strength, dexterity, constitution, and wisdom:
* Engage it melee combat or push [[boulder]]s around for '''[[strength]]'''.
* Hit monsters in melee or with [[projectile]]s, or use an [[unlocking tool]] to lock or unlock doors or containers for '''[[dexterity]]'''.
* [[Eat]] and avoid becoming [[hungry]] or [[satiated]] for '''[[constitution]]'''.
* Cast [[spell]]s, [[search]] for hidden things, or [[engrave]] [[Elbereth]] with uppercase "E" and lowercase "lbereth" for '''[[wisdom]]'''.

For more complete lists of exercise methods, see the relevant attribute pages.

===Attribute checks===
''NetHack'' does exercise checks at certain times: The first check happens on turn 600, and subsequent checks occur at random intervals of {{rn1|200|800}} turns from the last one.{{refsrc|src/allmain.c|590|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|608|nethack=3.6.6}} Upon a check, each counter is examined. If the corresponding attribute is already 18 or greater, nothing is done. Otherwise a random number between 0 and 49 inclusive is chosen. If it is greater than <math>|(2/3)*counter|</math> for a non-wisdom attribute or <math>|counter|</math> for wisdom, nothing is done. Otherwise, the attribute is changed by adding 1 if the counter was positive and subtracting 1 if it was negative, and the counter is set to zero. Afterwards, no matter what happened, the counter is halved, rounding toward 0.{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|526|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Abuse==
Abuse is the opposite of exercise - acts of abuse can undo exercise, or even cause your [[strength]], [[dexterity]], [[constitution]], or [[wisdom]] to drop.

Each act of abuse has an exactly 50% chance of reducing the attribute's exercise counter by 1.{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|426|nethack=3.6.6}} For a comprehensive list of abuse methods, see the relevant attribute pages. If your stats get lowered, use a [[unicorn horn]], [[potion of restore ability|potion]] or [[spellbook of restore ability|spell]] of restore ability to heal any such loss. 

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes. Alternatives include [[Potion of restore ability|potions of restore ability]], the [[Spellbook of restore ability|restore ability spell]], [[prayer]], or finding a way to exercise or increase that attribute again.}}

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], upon loading a saved game, if the first check has happened, the next check was set to happen from 800 (inclusive) to 850 (exclusive) turns afterwards. This meant that saving and reloading the game could have an in-game effect on the player's attributes. As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], this timer is saved to disk; the effect may persist in some variants based on previous versions.

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
[[UnNetHack]] removes the unicorn horn's ability to restore lost stats.

===SporkHack===
[[SporkHack]] also removes the ability of unicorn horns to restore lost stats.

The '''elven cloak''' is a [[cloak]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is a '''faded pall''' when [[identification|unidentified]]. 

==Generation==
[[Elf (starting race)|Elven]] [[Ranger]]s always start with a +2 elven cloak in place of a [[cloak of displacement]].

==Effects==
When worn, the elven cloak provides [[magic cancellation]] 1 and [[stealth]]; this will [[auto-identify]] it if you do not have any other source of stealth.

==Strategy==
{{main|Stealth}}
Elven cloaks can be a useful source of stealth for the [[Sokoban]] [[zoo]] and other [[special room]]s that the player might encounter. However, another source, e.g. a [[ring of stealth]], may be preferred if you already have a viable cloak.

Elven cloaks, along with [[elven boot]]s, are among the lightest and most common [[magical armor]], and can be safely enchanted past +5 to +7 like all [[elven item]]s; this makes them especially ideal for [[polypiling]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===

In [[SLASH'EM]], elven cloaks provide MC3.

==Messages==
{{message|You move very quietly.|You put on an elven cloak, and didn't already have stealth. (The cloak is auto-identified.)}}
{{message|You sure are noisy.|You removed your elven cloak, and didn't have any other source of stealth. (The cloak is auto-identified.)}}

==Encyclopaedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes they had brought.  For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadrim wove.  It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars.
