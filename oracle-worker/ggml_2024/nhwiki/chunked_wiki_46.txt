The '''dwarvish short sword''', which appears as a '''broad short sword''' when unidentified, can do a little more damage against small monsters than the ordinary short sword, though not as much as the elven short sword.  [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] are sometimes generated with one.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|239|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=dwarvish short swords}}  In addition, dwarvish short swords make up about 0.2% of randomly generated weapons.

Roles that normally start with a short sword would receive a dwarvish short sword when playing as a [[dwarf (starting race)|dwarf]].  However, dwarves cannot be [[Barbarian]]s, [[Rogue]]s, or [[Samurai]], the three roles that can start with short swords, so this substitution never occurs in vanilla NetHack.

The '''elven short sword''', which appears as a '''runed short sword''', does the most damage of all short swords to both [[Physical size|small and large]] targets (1d8/1d8, as much as a [[scimitar]] or a [[silver saber]] not dealing [[Silver#Silver damage|silver damage]]).  Elven short swords are also made of [[wood]], and therefore naturally immune to [[Erosion|corrosion and rusting]].  [[Elf (monster attribute)|Elves]] are often generated with one.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|239|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=elven short swords}}  In addition, elven short swords make up about 0.2% of randomly generated weapons.

Roles that normally start with a short sword would receive an elven short sword when playing as an [[elf (starting race)|elf]].  However, elves cannot be Barbarians, Rogues, or Samurai, the three roles that can start with short swords, so this substitution never occurs in vanilla NetHack.

The '''orcish short sword''', which appears as a '''crude short sword''' when unidentified, does the least damage versus [[Physical size|small]] monsters of any of the short swords, one point less than even the ordinary short sword.  It can be generated on [[Uruk-hai]]{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|367|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=Uruk-hai with short swords}} and [[orc-captain]]s{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|352|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=orc-captains can have Uruk-hai equipment}}.  In addition, orcish short swords make up about 0.3% of randomly generated weapons.

[[Orc (starting race)|Orcish]] Rogues and some orcish Barbarians start with a +0 orcish short sword.
{{clear}}

== Generation ==
Short swords of all kinds make up 1.5% of randomly generated weapons in the dungeon.  As noted above, [[racial equipment|racial]] short swords are commonly found on their respective racial monsters.

In addition, the following monsters may get short swords:
* [[Watchmen]] and [[soldier]]s in the [[Yendorian army]]{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|199|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=short swords on watchmen and soldiers}} and [[skeleton]]s{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|431|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=short swords on skeletons}} may be generated with a short sword.
* [[Ninja]] (on the [[Samurai quest]]) have a chance of getting a ''wakizashi''.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|272|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=Ninja wakizashi}}
* [[Player monster]] [[rogue]]s, such as Pug on the [[Wizard quest]], may be generated with a short sword.{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|229|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=player monster short swords}}

[[Rogue]]s{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|123|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=Rogue short sword}} and [[Samurai]]{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|134|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=Samurai wakizashi}} start with a [[Enchantment|+0]] short sword (''wakizashi'' for the latter).  A +0 short sword is also part of one of two starting packages for [[Barbarian]]s.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|676|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=Barbarian short sword}}

== Strategy ==
Among the weakest of the [[sword]]s, the short sword lacks the damage potential of stronger weapons, as well as an [[artifact weapon|artifact]] version. However, 10 of the 13 roles are capable of obtaining skill in it, 4 at expert, and short swords are normally plentiful even in the early game. One may be of some lasting value [[twoweapon|#twoweaponed]] with a stronger weapon or perhaps even with a second short sword.

== Variants ==
[[Silver short sword]]s can be found in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SporkHack]].

SLASH'EM also adds a few artifact short swords:<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/trek/mazewest/spoilers/arti_007e6.txt</ref>
* [[Quick Blade]] ([[elven short sword|elven]])
* [[Luckblade]]
* [[The Sword of Balance]] ([[silver short sword|silver]])
* [[Doomblade]] ([[orcish short sword|orcish]])

In [[xNetHack]], [[Fire and Frost Brand]] are short swords instead of [[long sword]]s.


==Encyclopedia entry==

===Wazikashi===
{{encyclopedia|
A wakizashi was used as a samurai's weapon when the katana
was unavailable.  When entering a building, a samurai would
leave his katana on a rack near the entrance.  However, the
wakizashi would be worn at all times, and therefore, it made
a sidearm for the samurai (similar to a soldier's use of a
pistol).  The samurai would have worn it from the time they
awoke to the time they went to sleep.  In earlier periods,
and especially during times of civil wars, a tanto was worn
in place of a wakizashi.

A '''broadsword''' is a kind of [[melee]] [[weapon]]. For [[samurai]], it is a '''ninja-to'''. The [[elven broadsword]] and [[runesword]] also use the broadsword skill.

==Generation==
Ordinary broadswords make up about 0.8% of randomly generated weapons (on the floor, as [[death drop]]s, or in [[shop]]s).

In addition, [[Yendorian Army]] lieutenants [[Monster starting inventory|may be generated with a broadsword]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|205|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} [[Balrog]]s are guaranteed to appear with one.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|442|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

== Broadsword skill ==

{{broadsword skill table}}

The following weapons use the broadsword skill:

* broadsword
* [[elven broadsword]]
* [[runesword]]
* [[Dragonbane]] (broadsword)
* [[Orcrist]] (elven broadsword)
* [[Stormbringer]] (runesword)

==Strategy==
Generally speaking, there are two reasons to train the broadsword [[skill]]: (1) if you are [[chaotic]] and plan to get [[Crowning|crowned]] so you can use [[Stormbringer]], or (2) if you can [[twoweapon]] and want to use an [[elven broadsword]] as your secondary weapon.  

===Stormbringer===
The first case applies mainly to [[Barbarian]]s and [[Rogue]]s, who are both unrestricted in the broadsword skill, though there are other good [[artifact weapon]] options for both roles.  These are not the only roles that can receive Stormbringer and wield it, but they are the only ones who start with the broadsword skill (as opposed to having it unrestricted by crowning) and so can train it before they are crowned.  Other roles that start with the skill (e.g. Knights) can also receive Stormbringer, but only if they are willing to change their [[alignment]] to chaotic.

===Broadswords as secondary weapons===
[[Elven broadsword]]s are a popular choice of secondary weapon, as they are easy to find (often generated on most [[Elf (monster attribute)|elves]]) and do respectable damage versus [[Physical size|"small"]] monsters, which includes many late-game targets.  However, skill level considerations make them better choices for some roles than for others.

When using two weapons, your [[to-hit]] and [[damage]] bonus or penalty is determined by the ''lowest'' of the three skills involved&mdash;your [[twoweapon]] skill and the skill levels of each weapon you are wielding. So when choosing a secondary weapon, two-weapon users prefer one that has a skill level no lower than their twoweapon skill.

[[Knight]]s, [[Rogue]]s, [[Samurai]], and [[Valkyrie]]s can all use broadswords with Skilled to-hit and damage adjustments.  [[Barbarian]]s and [[Tourist]]s can use them with Basic adjustments.  The broadsword skill is the limiting factor for Rogues, Samurai, and Tourists, so these roles might prefer secondary weapons that let them reach higher skill levels.

For Barbarians, Knights, and Valkyries, broadsword skill is not an obstacle, though there are other options that do better damage versus [[Silver damage|silver-hater]]s or "large" monsters.  See the [[Twoweapon#Choosing a secondary weapon|Twoweapon]] page for more good choices for each role.

==Appearance==
{{wikipedia|Basket-hilted sword}}

Historically "broadsword" refers to the basket-hilted sword, which has a basket-shaped guard that protects the hand of the wielder.  The term "broad" contrasts it with the similar but slender-bladed [[rapier]].

The cross-guard was improved as the development of firearms made many forms of armor (gauntlets and shields) ineffective.

A '''water moccasin''', {{monsym|water moccasin}}, is a variety of [[snake]], virtually identical to the normal snake but not generated at random. Like regular snakes, water moccasins will hide under items, are poisonous to eat, and have a 27% chance of imparting [[poison resistance]].

==Generation==
Moccasins are only generated in [[group]]s by quaffing from (or dipping an item into) a [[fountain]]; their presence in the absence of fountain quaffing is indicative of [[bones]] or a rogue [[shapeshifter]].

==Strategy==
Individually, water moccasins are similar enough to snakes that they can be dispatched in a similar manner. However, on top of necessitating poison resistance as usual, their decent speed and appearance in swarms will require efficient crowd control tactics, which may be further complicated if previous uses of the fountain caused pools of water to form.

This makes it a potent source of deaths for unsuspecting low-level characters; fortunately, players who do not use fountains will never have to deal with them, while those who wait until after the early game will likely be prepared.

Due to their affiliation with fountain quaffing, they are the fourth most frequent cause of death on [[nethack.alt.org]] (next to [[soldier ant]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[wand]]s); it is common in the #nethack channel on [[Libera]] to exclaim "Go team fountain!" on hearing of a water moccasin death.

==Origin==
Water moccasins are a species of venomous snake well known in the southeastern United States.

An [[object]] is normally allocated to have extra space after the end of the struct. Using <tt>ONAME(thing)</tt> retrieves some text from this extra space. I think that ONAME probably contains the name left with the #[[name]] command (such as "cursed" or "REAL", if you ever have a "yellow potion named cursed" or an "Amulet of Yendor named REAL"), however I would have to examine [[do_name.c]] more carefully to learn the details. I find this approach difficult to understand.

When you give a longer #name to an object, you would have to reallocate it, thus possibly making invalid any pointers to that object. It appears that in [[do_name.c]], do_oname calls oname which calls realloc_obj to do this. This process feels all unnecessary to me because I would have put a char* in the struct and allocated the name string separately. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)}

'''Leather armor''' is a type of [[body armor]] that confers two points of [[AC]]. Unlike metal armors, it does not hinder spellcasting. Leather armor is resistant to [[rust]] but susceptible to [[erosion|rot]]. It does not need to be identified (except for enchantment).

The [[Caveman]] and [[Rogue]] roles start with leather armor.

==Generation==
Armor comprises 10% of all randomly-generated items in the [[Dungeons of Doom|main dungeon]], 0% in [[container]]s, 12% on the [[Rogue level]], and 20% in [[Gehennom]]. There is an 82 in 964, or ~8.5%, chance that a randomly spawned armor object will be leather armor.<ref>http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/armr-343.html</ref>

In addition, leather armor is created abundantly by [[leather golem]]s, which [[Death drop|leave behind]] 2-8 leather armors when destroyed.  Each one may be [[BUC|blessed, cursed, or neither]] and have a positive, negative, or zero [[enchantment]].
<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/e34120648c374754</ref>

==Strategy==
* Many spellcasters prefer leather or [[studded leather armor]] in the early game, as neither hinders spellcasting.  It can also be easy to find positively enchanted leather armor by [[curse-testing]] and then wear-testing armor dropped by leather golems.

==Variants==
Leather armor became [[MC]]1 in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].  In variants (such as [[SLASH'EM]]) based on older versions, it may have an MC of 0.

In [[SLASH'EM]], leather and [[studded leather armor]] interfere with spellcasting just as metal armor does.  Generally speaking, [[Robe (SLASH'EM)|robes]] are the preferred body armor of SLASH'EM spellcasters.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Boiled leather}}
Historical leather armor was made of ''cuir bouilli'', thick leather that had been boiled in water (or possibly oil, wax, or ammonia) to harden it.  It was generally cut into scales or plates, which were then fastened together to make body armor.

==See also==
* [[Studded leather armor]], a body armor which is slightly heavier and more protective than leather armor.

The '''Valley of the Dead''' is the first level of [[Gehennom]], located immediately below the [[Castle]]. There is no downstairs on the castle level; you must either drop in via one of the [[trap door]]s in the Castle, or teleport in with controlled [[level teleport]]. [[Level teleport]]ing down from above, trying to skip the Valley, will land you in it instead, though level teleport from the Valley itself will work. Somewhere near the lower right is an up staircase; walking up these stairs will place you in a random location in the maze to the right of the [[Castle]]. The [[mysterious force]] no longer affects you as you go up from the Valley.

The level layout is always the same. It contains several [[graveyard]]s and a [[temple]] of [[Moloch]], with attending priest. The entrance to the rest of [[Gehennom]] is behind a [[secret door]], accessible through the temple. As the Valley of the Dead is part of [[Gehennom]], prayer will anger your [[God|deity]].

== Map ==
The layout of the Valley is almost fixed:

In [[NetHack 3.6.0]] and later, for each of the pairs {{brightcyan|Aa}}, {{yellow|Bb}}, and {{brightmagenta|Cc}}, one character is randomly replaced with solid walls, and the other is replaced with floor tiles: this results in a 50% chance of having to pass through each graveyard. (In previous versions of NetHack, and in many variants, the map is fixed: {{brightcyan|A}}{{yellow|B}}{{brightmagenta|C}} are always walls and {{brightcyan|a}}{{yellow|b}}{{brightmagenta|c}} are always floors, making all graveyards on the level optional.)

== Description ==
If you arrive by falling or jumping through a [[Castle]] [[trapdoor]], you will land within a few squares of the [[stairs|upstair]]. The [[alignment|unaligned]] [[temple]] on the left is attended by a peaceful [[aligned priest|priest]] of [[Moloch]]. In addition to the inhabitants of the three marked [[graveyard]]s, the level also contains six [[ghost]]s, three [[vampire bat]]s, four random [[mummy|mummies]], four random [[zombie]]s, three random [[Vampire (monster class)|vampires]], and a random [[lich]]. In addition to the boxes in the graveyards, there are four random pieces of [[armor]], four random [[weapon]]s, three random [[potion]]s, three random [[scroll]]s, two random [[wand]]s, two random [[ring]]s, two random [[spellbook]]s, three random [[tool]]s, a ruby, and two other random [[gem]]s. In addition to the [[corpse]]s in the graveyards, there are two other corpses of each character class save [[Monk]]s and [[Priest]]s. As you go from the temple to the downstair, in the top left corridor are two [[spiked pit]]s and a [[sleeping gas trap]], the trap in the center-left is a [[squeaky board]], the other two are [[dart trap]]s, and there are a further two [[magic trap]]s, two [[anti-magic trap]]s and one more squeaky board randomly located.

The entire level has [[digging|undiggable]] walls and floor. Attempting to cast a spell of [[magic mapping]] ("Your head spins as something blocks the spell.") or reading a [[scroll of magic mapping]] ("Your mind is filled with crazy lines. Your head spins in bewilderment.") will result in [[confusion]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the level is [[magic mapping|magic mappable]], and [[teleport]] is allowed.

The priest of [[Moloch]] is hostile and cannot be pacified, [[protection]] therefore can not be bought.

===UnNetHack===
[[UnNetHack]] has an alternate version of the Valley of the Dead originally taken from the [[Lethe patch]]. Much like the original, it has a lit temple, the same traps and monsters, a lot of player corpses, and similar loot lying around. Unlike the original, though, the upstairs are in a different position, a river cuts through the valley, and [[magic portal|portals]] to [[Vlad's_Tower|Vlad’s tower]], The [[Dragon_Caves|Dragon caves]], and [[Sheol]] are at the marked positions.

<br/>
Most of your turns are spent moving around the dungeon, so it is wise to
do so quickly and efficiently.  The rules of movement in roguespace
are eventually intuitive, but like all things in NetHack, there are
tricks and exceptions.

== Roguespace cardinal directions ==

{{Main|Direction}}
There are 8 cardinal directions in NetHack.

Certain [[ranged attack]]s of [[monster]]s only work when in line with you along one of the cardinals. These include thrown projectiles, [[breath attack]]s, [[venom]], and zapped [[wand]]s. Other attacks, such as a [[pyrolisk]]'s gaze, [[Medusa]]'s stare, and spells, can work from any position within a certain range. In the following example, you are safe from the yellow [[dragon]], but not from the pyrolisk:

<div class='ttyscreen'><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]
D={{msl|yellow dragon}}
c={{msl|pyrolisk}}
/={{green|/}}
-={{green|-}}
\={{green|\}}
|={{green|{{!}}}}

.|../......
.|./.......
\|/..@.....
-D---------
/|\.....c..
.|.\.......
</replacecharsblock></div>

Moving north-east on the next turn keeps you out of the dragon's reach.

== Fighting in corridors ==

In the following example, [[killer bee]]s are moving towards you:

<div class="ttyscreen"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]
a={{msl|killer bee}}

---------              
|.......|    ----------
|.......|    |....a...|
|...@....####..aaa....|
|.......|    |..aa.....
|.......|    ----------
---------              
</replacecharsblock></div>

If you stay where you are, they will swarm around you on 6 of the possible 8 sides and very likely finish you off. If you move into the corridor, only one can be adjacent to you at once, allowing you to pick them off one at a time. Corridors are thus an excellent place to fight.

Be aware that corridors are not lit (though see the [[lit_corridor]] option), so monsters may be approaching you in the dark parts!

== Diagonal movement ==

If you are using the arrow keys to move, you are as good as dead. Switch
to either the numpad or the [[yuhjklbn]] keys, and you have access
to diagonal movement, which can as much as double the efficiency of your
moves (moving two spaces north, then two spaces east can be accomplished
by moving two spaces northeast).

Reaching the door in 3 moves:

<div class="ttyscreen"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]
q={{msl|rothe}}

---------   ---------   ---------   ---------
|..q....|   |.......|   |.......|   |.......|
|....@..|   |...q.@.|   |....q.@|   |.......|
|.......+   |.......+   |.......+   |.....q@+
---------   ---------   ---------   ---------
</replacecharsblock></div>

Reaching the door in 2 moves:

<div class="ttyscreen"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]
q={{msl|rothe}}

---------   ---------   ---------
|..q....|   |.......|   |.......|
|....@..|   |...q.@.|   |.......|
|.......+   |.......+   |....q.@+
---------   ---------   ---------
</replacecharsblock></div>

Clearly, making good use of diagonal movement will save your life -
possibly more than any other single playing tip.

=== Beartraps ===

For some reason, escaping a [[beartrap]] is 5 times more likely when moving diagonally than when moving orthogonally.{{refsrc|hack.c|1250}}

Do ''not'' attempt to jump out of beartraps. You will severely damage your legs and reduce your HP.

=== Doors ===

Doorways cannot normally be passed diagonally. This creates a tactical challenge
when escaping through one, but since the restriction applies to monsters
too, it can be useful for creating bottlenecks. 

In [[Fort Ludios]], standing on the square shown allows you to kill [[soldier]]s
as they come through the door one at a time, while also protecting you
from thrown [[potion]]s and wand zaps from the horde (since you are not in
line with any of them along a cardinal direction).

<div class="ttyscreen"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]
^=[[magic portal|{{brightmagenta|^}}]]

-------......
|.....|......
|.....+......
|...@.|......
|.....|......
|..-+----....
|..|....|....
|..|..^.|....
-----------..
</replacecharsblock></div>

Conversely, a broken doorway can be passed diagonally. Consider breaking doors (by kicking or with a [[wand of striking]]) if you want to slip past a monster blocking the other side. Pets, including leashed ones, also pass through doorways easier if the door has been broken.

Certain actions can override the restriction on diagonal movement through doorways, such as failing to disarm a dart or arrow trap diagonally from the doorway.

=== Passing small gaps ===

In the following mine level, the character can only move southwest if
his or her total [[inventory]] weight is 600 or less. Otherwise, "You are carrying too much to get through."

<div class="ttyscreen"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]

       ---   
    ----.--  
 ---|.....---
--..|@......|
|....--.--..|
-. ----------
</replacecharsblock></div>

This limit applies to all tight gaps, not just those in the [[Gnomish Mines]].  Note that monsters of [[size]] Large or above also cannot pass through such small gaps.  This can be useful for escape and/or attack.

=== Northwest danger ===

If using the vi-keys, be cautious when moving northwest ({{kbd|y}})
around peaceful creatures. {{kbd|y}} is also the command to say ''yes'' to a
question such as "<tt>Really attack Izchak?</tt>", and it's nearly always a
good idea to answer no. Setting the ''paranoid_hit'' [[options|option]] (available if your game was compiled with the 'paranoid' patch) to ''true'' will help, as this will require you to explicitly type "yes" to hit peacefuls.

== Hit and run ==
{{main|hit and run}}
Hit and run is a common tactic in [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier that allows weaker players to fight stronger foes, as long as they are faster. The concept is to time your moving and hitting so that you always attack on the turn that your opponent doesn't get a move. If skillfully executed, even powerful foes such as [[mumak|mumakil]] or [[dragon|dragons]] can be killed by a weak player. This is also an excellent way to train weapons and get experience in the early game, particularly against [[black pudding]]s and [[mimic]]s.

In [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the tactic is much harder to pull off because monster movement now has a large random factor. In [[NetHack 3.6.1]], it is entirely eliminated; monsters are equally likely to move on any given turn regardless of what happened on previous turns.

==Moving without attacking or picking up objects==
{{main|m|g}}
Especially when you are [[blind]] in [[cockatrice]] territory, or if you are [[Pacifist#Team_gecko|playing a pacifist]], you might prefer a command {{kbd|m}} that neither picks up nor feels objects on the floor, and mostly avoids attacking monsters. "Mostly" means the interaction with [[warning]] is buggy: if the [[warning]] symbol does not cover a non-displayed {{white|I}} remembered monster position, moving with {{kbd|m}} attacks anyway; it also attacks a monster [[engulfing]] you.

The {{kbd|g}}, {{kbd|G}}, and capital YUHJKLBN keys can be used to [[autopickup exceptions|autopickup loot]] mostly without attacking.

== Boulders ==

[[Boulder]]s can be pushed around, but are otherwise impassable to
characters carrying items. If your inventory is completely empty or you are 850 or more units below your carrying capacity,{{refsrc|hack.c|287}} "you
can squeeze yourself into a small opening" and occupy the same square as
the boulder.

== Jumping ==
{{main|Jumping}}
     
[[Knight]]s can jump naturally, but only in the shape of a chess knight's
jump. Casting the spell of jumping allows you to jump to the following
locations, depending on your skill in the escape category
({{blue|u}}nskilled, {{green|b}}asic, {{yellow|s}}killed, or {{red|e}}xpert):

<div class="ttyscreen"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[you|{{white|@}}]]
u={{blue|u}}
b={{green|b}}
s={{yellow|s}}
e={{red|e}}

...eee...
.esbubse.
.suuuuus.
ebuuuuube
euuu@uuue
ebuuuuube
.suuuuus.
.esbubse.
...eee...
</replacecharsblock></div>

[[Jumping boots]] let you jump as if casting the spell unskilled. All types of jumping require that you can see the target square, happen in one turn, and consume d25 nutrition.{{refsrc|apply.c|1363}} This means jumping is faster than walking with [[speed boots]].

You can jump out of [[pit]]s, [[web]]s, and [[lava]], and also beartraps, but doing the latter wounds one of your legs for 500 to 1499
turns and causes d10 damage.{{refsrc|apply.c|1318}}

== Moving through crowds ==

[[Teleport control]] allows instant movement to any square on any
teleport-enabled level. For non-teleport levels, teleportation still
works on monsters, so zapping a wand of teleportation at a crowd is the
best way to clear a path through them.

A [[ring of conflict]] can also help, firstly by distracting monsters from
you, and secondly by reducing, through combat, the HP of any monster you
do have to kill to get past.

== The Plane of Air ==

Movement on the [[Plane of Air]] is controlled only if you are levitating or flying. Otherwise, only 1 in 4 of your attempts to move is successful.

==Most hopeless death==
So I was on IRC tonight, and we were having some fun chatting. One guy says he's in the mines and has one hp. Then:
; (name clipped) (Wiz Hum Mal Cha), 1136 points, killed by a worthless piece of white glass
What's the most pathetic death you've seen? [[User:Fredil Yupigo|Fredil Yupigo]] 01:54, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

I was killed trying to mount my pony in a game of Net Nethack. I slipped and died. --[[Special:Contributions/216.228.41.12|216.228.41.12]] 02:24, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

I died by kicking a wall [[User:ItazuEstamaru|ItazuEstamaru]] 16:26, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

I died eating an egg.  Turned out to be from a cockatrice, who would have known?  -Billob
:That's why I never eat eggs unless I'm desperate.--[[User:Kahran042|Kahran042]] 05:27, 3 September 2008 (UTC)
:This one was pretty sad for me:
:*'''Val Hum Fem Law), 287938 points, Phranck,choked on a lump of royal jelly'''
:I just got really greedy and didn't notice I was oversatiated :( [[User:Addps4cat|Addps4cat]] 18:49, 3 September 2008 (UTC)
::Once I had Magicbane, but forgot I had Magicbane, and was killed by a giant ant :( [[User:Fredil Yupigo|Fredil Yupigo]] 02:20, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

* ok, this isn't death (yet), but I've just done the most utterly retarded thing in nethack... i mean, you know how some terminal emulators (notably PuTTY) allow you to paste text by clicking the mouse?... ok, you guessed the rest... i'll only add that I had about ~1k of a written text in the clipboard... I honestly don't have any idea what exactly happened in the split second that the paste operation went off but I'm sure I was just a tiny bit from YASD... and how pathetic would this be?... argh... ps. i really, really don't know how this managed to toggle this amount of options, but I finally got round to setting them the way I like (afterwards, I mean... I _had_ to...) ;))) - [[User:Blueshade|Blueshade]] 00:04, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

Killed by a very fast invisble archlich at level 9 of the dungeon.
I was happily exploring a new dungeon level. It "all happened" in 1 turn . The message was looking like:
It Hits, it hits, it hits [...] It casts finger of death... You die... DYWYPI ?

    I was killed by tripping on my cat, instead of displacing it or stopping.  It did 23 damage.

==How to identify gray stones in containers?==
I am familiar with the kick test for seeing if a gray stone is a [[loadstone]].  However, how can one determine if a gray stone in a container is a loadstone?  After all, the container weight makes it impossible to kick the container, regardless of the stone inside.  [[User:RJaguar3|RJaguar3]] 14:24, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

:As far as I know, this is one of those corner cases where there's no perfect strategy. I think you'll either have to take a chance and grab it, or else leave it alone. -- [[User:Killian|Killian]] 14:55, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

:If you can get a gelatinous cube to eat the container, and then kill it, the suspected loadstone will end up on the floor. Maybe then you'll be able to kick it. [[Special:Contributions/91.84.221.238|91.84.221.238]] 15:08, 15 July 2008 (UTC)
::You can #[[Force]] the container with a blunt object, such as a [[quarterstaff]], repeatedly to destroy the container; the contents will then be left on the ground. Be sure to take out potions and such before doing so, though. [[User:Fredil Yupigo|Fredil Yupigo]] 17:49, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

:Ideally, but very tedious: Take out everything but the mystery stone. Then get another container of the same kind, and an identified safe grey stone of any kind. Drop all your inventory and lift each container in turn. If they have the same effect on you ("Burdened" in both cases, say, or nothing in both cases) then gradually pick up other items and repeat. If they both roll over from burdened to stressed on the same round, then it's not a loadstone; if one jumps before the other, it is. More practically: take out everything but the mystery stone and lift the container. If it's a loadstone, it will be a bigger-than-expected burden. 

:But, since the DevTeam thinks of everything, the game offers a rare kindness for your situation: loadstones generated in containers will not always autocurse the ''first'' time you pick them up. This happened to me two hours ago. Stupidly, I picked it up again.--Jack

:My policy is not to retrieve a gray stone from a container if I even suspect that it's a loadstone.  It's not worth the risk, especially considering the guaranteed luckstone at the bottom of the Mines.  Still, all four gray stones in vanilla NetHack have their unique properties:  touchstones go "scritch, scritch" when you rub an iron object on them; flint stones draw no price when offered in a general store; loadstones fail the kick test; and luckstones have none of the preceding properties.  (If you're playing SLASH'EM, you also have the healthstone to deal with.)  In this way, the four gray stones can be identified, and perhaps you can figure out which stone you're looking at.--[[User:Ray Chason|Ray Chason]] 14:24, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

:You could pick up the container. It should be much heavier with a loadstone. --[[Special:Contributions/24.225.69.8|24.225.69.8]] 06:29, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

==Lance training==
Does [[pounding]] train the lance skill, and does it matter whether you're mounted or unmounted? What about attacking with the lance while on foot? Getting my lance skill up could be difficult if the only option is to attack while mounted and risk breaking it every time. [[User:404notfound|404notfound]] 18:57, 18 July 2008 (UTC)
:You can't "pound" a lance. Pounding is when you apply a polearm, while [[jousting]] happens when you apply a lance. Every succesful joust will exercise the lance skill (see [[uhitm.c#line657]] and [[uhitm.c#line907]]). You must be mounted to be able to joust. You can exercise your lance (as long as you do at least 2 damage) while unmounted but you won't be able to joust. [[User:Addps4cat|Addps4cat]] 14:58, 25 August 2008 (UTC)
::You most certainly can "pound" a lance.  You don't even have to be mounted to do it.  It works just like pounding with a polearm.  Pounding (mounted or unmounted), jousting, and hitting normally while mounted with a lance all exercise lance skill. (Bashing with the lance doesn't.) [[User:Marcmagus|Marcmagus]] 16:23, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

==Astral fun!==
I was playing wizard mode games on the astral plane, and saw a player monster named "Andy the invisible Necromancer". I killed him, and in his corpse were two wands of death - 0:3 and 0:7! What were the odds of that!? [[User:Fredil Yupigo|Fredil Yupigo]] 01:25, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

:By my calculations, the chance of an Astral PM being generated with 2+ wands of death is about 0.1%. There are apparently 3–6 of them on Astral, so the exact chance would depend on how many you kill and loot. -- [[User:Killian|Killian]] 02:09, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

:Did you notice his name? He's a ''necromancer''; it's probably a DevTeam joke.

==Patching Nethack for Windows==

== The Platinum Yendorian Express Card and wizards ==
So, I'm playing a wizard and I am getting close to the castle and will get my wand of wishing. I have almost all resistances (save for disintegrate, but I'm working on it.) and I was thinking of making one of my wishes the PYEC. The [[Wish]] page says it's ok for a Neutral character to wish for it, yet the PYEC is an intelligent artifact and it says it will blast me if I use it if I'm not the proper role. So, my question is - should I wish for the card or not? Even if it blasts me, will I still be able to recharge my items with it?
:If you're neither neutral nor a Tourist, forget about the PYEC -- it will evade your grasp.  If you're neutral but not a tourist, you can charge things with the PYEC, but you will only get the ''uncursed'' charging effect.  The bottom line here is ''never'' charge a [[wand of wishing]] or [[magic marker]] with the PYEC unless you are a Tourist, because these objects can be charged only once and you want that charge to be the blessed kind.  Use a blessed [[scroll of charging]] instead.
:My style is never to wish for artifacts, not just for the [[conduct]] but also because I don't accept the risk of failure.  I'll wish for a magic marker if I must, and two scrolls of charging if that's also necessary; once I have a magic marker and have identified the scroll of charging, I tend to find I can get all the charges I need.--[[User:Ray Chason|Ray Chason]] 18:36, 10 August 2008 (UTC)
::I guess I'll forget about it then. Also, the character is in Explore mode so his score and conduct don't really matter that much. I think I'll use the wishes for 2 blessed scrolls of charging, a marker and....for something else I can't think of right now. (gotta check what I need)
::Note that blessed and uncursed charging have the same effect on an empty magic marker. (For wishing, though, definitely use blessed scrolls.) [[Special:Contributions/92.236.187.64|92.236.187.64]] 12:53, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

== Master Mind Flayers ==

Hello everyone, I have a question re Mind Flayers. I have yet to meet one but my friend as well as various nethack spoilers tell me that they can make you forget items you have previously identified. My question then is this: I have identified a gem, and #name'd it as such. If a Mind Flayer removes my memory of that identified gem will the #name remain? If so would #name'ing all my items be a viable defense?



Thanks,

Tim


:Yes, if you individually name each item, then you will remember the names after an amnesia attack (note that amnesia might make you forget the names you assigned for each ''class'' of items). See #[[name]] for more information. —[[User:Shijun|Shijun]] 22:46, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

== Loss of ability to search ==

Something rather strange happened in a recent game. Very early on (first 500 turns or so) I failed in trying to convert an altar and ended up converting myself. I knew this made the game unwinnable, but decided to play on for fun. (Because it was just after finding a WoW and giving myself a nice ascension-quality armor kit, no less!)  I was a neutral human archaeologist, and sacrificed a werewolf, without thinking, pissing off my god severely. I forgot that this also made the altar chaotic, so I sacrificed again to appease my god and ended up getting converted.

Anyway, the strange part is that I apparently couldn't search for anything--doors, traps--at all after this. No matter how long I searched in a spot where I knew there was a door, I never found it, although digging would yield "You break through a secret door?" Is this some weird punishment I've never seen before, or is it possible that my luck was so low as to make successful searching completely impossible? How low would this have to be, if so? (I played about 10 000 turns total before succumbing to a mind flayer.)
:Well I looked into it a bit. If you look at [[detect.c#line1191]] you'll see 
 if(rnl(7-fund)) continue;
:This is basically making a call to the random number generator that is influenced by luck (see [[Rnd.c#rnl]]). Basically that function needs to return a zero for you to find your door. You'll see that right after that it makes a call that reveals the door:
 cvt_sdoor_to_door(&levl[x][y]);	/* .typ = DOOR */
:Anyway, with the worst luck possible (-13), and no artifacts or lenses you have a roughly 0.2231% (~1 in 450) chance of revealing it each turn. You'd have to search for about 1400 turns to have a 95% chance of the door being revealed. [[User:Addps4cat|Addps4cat]] 13:04, 24 August 2008 (UTC)

== elemental planes ==

I'm never able to make it past the elemental planes. What always happens is archons and titans keep summoning more of each other until the entire level is filled with them. Wearing a ring of conflict doesn't seem to be enough to thin their numbers, unfortunately. What am I supposed to do? How do you deal with the hordes of archons? I'm wondering - perhaps I'm genociding too many classes of monsters and thus, their summon spells summon more of each other? Maybe I should pursue a more minimalist genociding strategy?

:You shouldn't try to kill them all of them. Archons and others can be zapped with a wand of teleportation. If you get surrounded, you can't teleport yourself but you might get away by breaking a wand of teleportation. --[[Special:Contributions/24.225.69.8|24.225.69.8]] 22:32, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

::Thanks.   I just ascended for the first time :)  (As a Caveman.)  This time, I didn't genocide very many species; I found that the archons did not summon more archons this time around.  I also made a point of bringing a few wands of teleportation along (plus 3 wands of death, for good measure) just in case I started getting surrounded again.  In the Astral plane, I did find that there were a lot of monsters, but not nearly as many as the archons used to summon when I genocided 20+ species.

==Recovering games on NAO==

So my internet connection is spotty at best.  I was playing on NAO the other day, and I lagged out/disconnected while I was waiting for the terminal to tell me what happened after I attacked a monster (I think it was a gnome king).  I futzed with my wireless for a bit, and then tried to log in again.  NAO had me wait a bit while it resolved some stale processes, which happens when you DC, and it said something about a stale monster (don't remember exactly).  So just my luck, I got disconnected ''again'' while this was going on.  I logged in yet again, afraid that something horrible had gone wrong, and indeed, I got:

::Shall I pick a character's race, role, gender and alignment for you? [ynq] 

Panicking, I checked the page for my account (https://alt.org/nethack/plr.php?player=Handrocles) and indeed, after several days it still shows my game as it was when I crashed.  I daren't try to start a new game or anything, beyond the message above.  Now, and here's the clincher: RNG knows I die often enough, but on this particular game I found a wand of wishing (0:3) on turn 12, an amulet of life saving, and later in Izchak's shop I got two magic lamps!  Needless to say, this character is pimped out (AC -1 at level 1, as a wizard!).  The RNG giveth, and the RNG taketh away, but I'd really hate to lose this game to anything other than my own stupidity.

So, here are my questions:

# Has anyone else had this happen before, and what happened if you started a new game on top of your old one?
# Is there any way I can contact someone on NAO to try to recover this game?  

I wouldn't even be bothering anyone if this weren't my best game ever ever, but given what's gone on so far I think it's worth trying to save.

Thanks!
--[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 16:59, 2 September 2008 (UTC)

When similar stuff happens on my local machine, I "save-scum": zip the entire nethackdir up before doing anything else, and then try [[recover]].[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 00:58, 2 December 2008 (UTC)

== I die alot ==

Everytime I start a wizard I die around the mines area (i suck). But more often than not its because I run out of energy first killing all those damn gnomes (as I am an elf, also last game my pet died). Normaly my pet would take care of everything but I feel like I relying on mittens too much. Is their something I should be doing? I'm engraving elbereth alot too. [[User:Glisignoli|Ha! Showed you!]] 00:28, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

:Using your pet and engraving E are both good techniques. The next thing I can suggest is to start picking up and throwing daggers, since starting Wizards don't really have enough power to use spells exclusively. Don't forget to curse-test and wear armour you find, too. Non-metal armour is best, but depending on your spell selection you might find that extra AC is more important in the short-term than spellcasting. Once you can survive long enough to find an altar and start sacrifice-camping for Magicbane, the Wizard game tends to get a whole lot easier. -- [[User:Killian|Killian]] 03:37, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

== Quantum Mechanics ==

I've never had a chance to figure this one out:

When you kill a Quantum Mechanic you sometimes get a box left behind.  This box either contains a live cat or a dead cat (i.e. Schrodenger's box).  I have always wondered what happens when you shoot a wand of probing at Schrodengers box? Is the cat alive, dead, or alive and dead at the same time?

anyone ever try this one?

:The cat (alive or dead) is created by {{function|pickup.c|observe_quantum_cat}}, which is only called when the box is opened. In fact, a comment in this function explicitly notes that other forms of observation ''should'' determine the cat's state, but don't. I haven't tested this, but based on my reading of the code I would expect the box to be considered empty by the probe. -- [[User:Killian|Killian]] 15:00, 19 September 2008 (UTC)

:That's fantastic that the DevTeam has considered this problem.  Any other ideas on how to detect the cat without opening the box?  Maybe telepathy?  It's definitely a Small Matter of Programming to properly implement all the possibilities. --[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 15:39, 19 September 2008 (UTC)
::The cat isn't in the box until it's looted. I just did a wizmode test, and neither telepathy nor probing revealed anything. [[User:Fredil Yupigo|Fredil Yupigo]] 02:25, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

== Recovering games ==

Hey everyone,

I have a first generation Macbook that has the great habit of crashing.  Whenever I'm playing the game and it crashes, I lose that particular game.  It seems that all of my good games stretch just long enough to have the computer destroy them.

I usually uninstall and reinstall NetHack to get it to work again whenever this happens, but this last game I got down to Medusa's Lair (dungeon level 21), much farther than I've ever gotten.  I don't want to reinstall the game just to get that far and have it crash again, so I was wondering if there was a way to recover this character and continue playing?

I'm using Nethack 3.4.3, Mac OS X tile port.  The operating system version is 10.4.11N

Many thanks

I am in a similar bind. My computer started to crash as I was fighting a Zruty. I was doing great, I had potions of full heal, SDSM, ring of polymorph control, wands of polymorph, I was on my way to create monsters to sacrifice at an altar when my system froze, I pressed a few buttons, a few of the actions resolved themselves really quickly and then my system crashed. Usually when my system crashes I just put my character's name in and it says "There are some files under the name "xxxx", restore?" and it starts me off at the current level stairs, losing a load of progress at times or at times it is merely a minor inconvenience. But this time it did not load, it created a new character. I feel really bummed; when Nethack kills me, I accept it. But Mage Hand (my character) isn't even on the top 10 list, (she was the farthest I've ever gotten) it's as though she never existed. 
I'm using the latest version of Nethack on Windows.
Is there balm in Gilead?

* First, before even starting Nethack again, the entire application (right-click on its icon and choose compress) so you can play around with it safely. Do the next steps each on a freshly decompressed copy.
* Next, try to start Nethack again.
* If that does not help, reboot the Macbook. Yes, this does help astonishingly often (though I have a later generation macbook).
* Try the recover command line utililty. At least my build of tiles Nethack does not invoke it automatically, though in the second poster's case it seems to. Do do this, open up Terminal.app (applications -> utilites), and type
 cd /Users/tjr/Desktop/NetHack/NetHack.app
 ls ./nethackdir/[0-9]*cavemanfred.*
where /Users/tjr/Desktop/ must be replaced with the full path to your copy of Nethack and cavemanfred with your character's name. If the second command prints anything, say "502cavemanfred.0", "502cavemanfred.1" and so on, then type
 ./nethackdir/recover 502cavemanfred
and you should get your game back, restored at the point of time you last changed dungeon levels.
* If that still does not help, you should acquire a habit of save-scumming to ward agaist crashes. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 16:10, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

:There's no way to remap the keys via NetHack itself.

== Hello <player>! I was looking for Zippo ==

I've never seen a message like the one above before. It's quite early in the game, I'm on Dlvl 5, a bones level from hearse with (at least) two ghosts of this Zippo. One already destroyed, the other one is currently visible to me via ESP, but not directly. Noone who could be speaking is around. The context was: 

>>The hobgoblin corpse tastes terrible! "Hello 313! I was looking for Zippo." You finish the hobgoblin corpse.<< 

What unknown speaking monster could be lurking here or is the game itself talking to me?

== looking for a qtnethack version ==

I play Nethack on Windows. Several years back, I was able to find a compiled *Windows executable version of qtnethack (3.3.1 I believe). Would anyone know where I can get a WinXP executable qtnethack 3.4.3 version?
:The official Qt NetHack for Linux uses Qt 3.  Licensing issues inhibit the use of the Windows version of Qt 3 in free projects such as NetHack.  The current version, Qt 4, is license compatible, but a somewhat different beast from the programmer's point of view.  So getting Qt NetHack running on Windows would be a whole new porting job.

== Applying lethe patch in SLASH'EM ==

Gehennom is boring and i really want to fight Cthulu. How do i apply that lethe patch? i got it from the lethe patch atricle here i just don't know what to do with it. . thank you very much

:I've never played SLASH'EM or used the Lethe patch, but I'm guessing that the patch is meant to be applied to vanilla NetHack.  Since SLASH'EM's Gehennom is somewhat different there may be some buggy issues if you try the patch there.  --[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 17:55, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

It is the SLASH'EM version of the patch.  SLETHE 1.5.  It is meant to be used on slash'em but i just don't know how to apply a patch. like at all.  I love the game but i sadly have never learned the mechanics

;Ah I see.  Yea, I've failed to apply some patches myself.  --[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 18:15, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

== Losing intrinsics ==
I just had a death that confuses me and I'm wondering if I misunderstand the rules. I was poison resistant and was wearing an amulet of life saving, but I fell into a pit and got killed by poison spikes.

Is that poison special? Or do intrinsics perhaps have a time limit? I got intrinsic poison resistance from eating corpses way back at the beginning of the game, and my death was around turn 80,000. I know it wasn't stolen by a gremlin because I genocided them ten thousand turns ago, and had got enlightenment from a fountain more recently than that.

:[[Instadeath]] from poison is indicated by the message ''The poison was deadly...''  This shouldn't have happened to you if you're poison resistant, but the spikes also cause HP damage no matter what, so that might have killed you.  None of this should happen if you're wearing a amulet of LS, but are you sure you had it on?  I've died more than once with an amulet in my inventory :/  --[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 17:55, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

:: I did see the "poison was deadly" message on death, and when I had my possessions identified the amulet was marked as (being worn). Hmph. Must have been sunspots.
:: Mystery solved. My buddy the comedian installed a modified version on my local machine, fixed so the first spiked pit trap in the Valley of the Dead would be instadeath regardless of resistances, life saving, or levitation. Bastard.
::: Your buddy must be quite the nerd to code and install a NetHack variant just to mess with you.

== Dumpfile locations? ==
Hi. I'm playing SLASH'EM-gtk on Ubuntu, and I ascended for the first time recently. My habit whenever I ascend in vanilla Nethack is to save the dumpfile that gets generated with my final map, stats, kill-record, etc. Nethack-gnome generates these in a directory under /var/games/nethack. Slash'em doesn't seem to have generated a parallel directory, and I can't find a dumpfile (that's what they're called, right?). I haven't played the game since to avoid over-writing it, but I fear the details may be lost forever. So where would I look for such a file; and if none is being generated, how can I change Slash'em's settings so that it will make them?

Also, as long as I'm on the topic: NethackW (GUI) for Windows XP, same question.

Thank you.

== Missing Vlad ==

I've never gotten past my quest in vanilla until now, so I'm not entirely sure what to expect.  Still, nothing that I've read has been able to help me.

Long story short, I lost Vlad.  Or, well, the candleabrum.  I was attacking him a bit carelessly in his usual location and he died (or maybe disappeared, I didn't pay much attention).  I looted the chest behind him and sat on the throne.  Afterwards, I looked up a spoiler and realized that he is supposed to drop the candleabrum.  I searched everywhere in the tower and found nothing.  I checked the stairs and next floors to make sure he didn't move down to heal like the demon lords and I still didn't find him.  I even checked several different levels of hell around where he was.

I have see invisible, intrinsic and extrinsic telepathy and warning, so I'm pretty sure I didn't miss him.  Any ideas?

: Perhaps he read a cursed [[scroll of teleportation]] and [[levelport]]ed away?  If he did that he could be almost anywhere.  (Uncontrolled levelport takes you somewhere between level 1 and current depth + 3)  -- [[User:Marcmagus|Marcmagus]] 22:00, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

He must have.  I finally found him on the eighth floor.  Took forever to find him :)

== Stuck ==

I am currently playing a level 16 rogue on the quest level, he got there by falling down a hole. He fell into the big room in the center of the room and after a while, managed to beat the master assassin by polymorphing him into a glass piercer. Once he was dead i began searching for the door out. 2000 turns later i still haven't found it. It would be great if i could be provided with the location to the door out. ~ Adino

:So the final level of the [[Rogue quest]] has two sections: one with the upstair, and one with the Master Assassin.  The walls are undiggable, and I believe the whole place is no-teleport, so the only way out is by some means of levelport (confused [[scroll of teleportaion]], cursed [[potion of gain level]] etc.  Normally one puts in some preparation for this level, so if you got there by accident you may be stuck until you starve.  --[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 18:01, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

Edit: I had a uncursed magic lamp and a wand of polymorph so i tried to use it to wish for a ring of polymorph control to turn myself into a xorn and walk through the wall. It didn't work and i summoned a peaceful genie, i was really ticked of at that point so i killed the genie, it droped a potion, sky blue. Figuring i had nothing to lose i drank it, it turned out to be a potion of confusion! I wrote a scroll of teleport and teleported back to the first quest level! All and all i'm VERY lucky to be alive.

:Wow, well played.  The xorn thing would have worked too.  --[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 18:01, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

== Survival ==
I have to be missing something stupidly basic about this game. How do you survive the swarms of monsters (or single strong monsters) that camp out around the up stairs after about dungeon-level 6?

After lots of practice I have gotten my class level as high as 9. That involved killing every single monster on every level, and luckily finding a few potions of gain level. Yet no matter how much or how little I grind for XP, I get nuked going down a set of stairs. On the new level I either find myself adjacent to half a dozen killer bees or soldier ants, or else one ettin or giant or something huge, and either way I get two pages of attack messages and "You are dead..." before I even get a chance to press a key. 

I'm not burdened or starving or dead of some other cause. I'm just ambushed and smashed by monsters before I can react. I do try to have escape items like scrolls of teleport, and one time I even had a wand of death, but I don't get even one turn to use them before dying.

On all my attempts at the game, 100+ attempts have gotten past dungeon-level 6, and every one of them has been smushed before I get to dungeon level 10. 

This is seriously frustrating. What am I doing wrong?


:It sounds as though you have low AC. This of course can be improved by wearing armor. If not that, what class are you playing? Maybe your just have a weak in hp class like rogue.

:By "low", the previous unsigned commenter presumably means "poor". It sounds that way to me as well; equipment matters quite a bit in NetHack. Increasing your level won't help all that much if this is your problem, as increasing your level leads to meeting tougher monsters.  Your difficulty with dying before you get a turn makes me wonder if you are going about encumbered.  Any [[encumbrance]] will make you get fewer turns than normal, so even just being Burdened can be quite dangerous, especially when entering a new level.  Hope these help.  --[[User:Marcmagus|Marcmagus]] 01:15, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

== Help with turning off popups ==

How do you turn off the pop up menu in the Windows version of Nethack, which appears when there is more than one item, but less than several on a square you move your character onto? It is so annoying to have to hit the enter key all the time in a room which has a lot of items...

== Pet weight limit ==

Do pets have a weight limit on what they will take from a shop? Ie my small dog will only pick up boots etc and not a crystal plate mail? The platemail is uncursed, as my pet has run over it multiple times.

--Yes, but I'd love to know how much it is. [[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 20:41, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

: update on [[credit_cloning]]: Sometimes your pet will not pick up your "stealing bag" because it is too heavy. Base monster carrying capacity is equal to human maximum carrying capacity, or half human maximum if not strong. This is then modified by the ratio between the monster weights and human weights. Corpseless monsters are given a capacity proportional to their size instead of weight.<ref>{{function|Mon.c|max_mon_load}}</ref> [[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 18:21, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

:: Please tell me if I'm doing the correct calculations: Maximum carrying capacity is 1000 and a [[Human (monster)|human]] has a weight of 1450. A [[ Kitten]] weighs 150 (and is presumably not strong) so it can carry .5*1000/1450*150 = 51? What is this 'strong' characteristic? [[User:DemonDoll|DemonDoll]] 18:59, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

:::Nethack uses purely integer arithmetic. I emulated this by rounding after each elementary operation (order matters), and arrived at 52. I'm not too sure it is correct, but wiz mode testing suggests so. The strong attribute is a property some monsters just have - I've only seen it matter in carrying capacity. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 23:34, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

== Randomized appearance ==

Hello. I recently obtained two wands that had the same appearance (platinum)

After making sure they were uncursed, I engraved with them to see what they might be. Turns out they were both wands of sleep. Does this mean that when two items have the same randomized appeareance, they are always of the same type? I am hoping so! The article Randomized appearance does not explain this yet however.

Also, the wand item never stacks, even if they are of the same type right? {{unsigned|Gavin77|4 June 2009}}

: In the same game, items with the same randomized appearance are always the same base type, e. g. wands of sleep. (BTW by engraving alone, you cannot tell it apart from a wand of death, but the odds are 1:6 it's sleep.) It is normal for wands not to stack; stackability mainly concerns BUC status, enchantment, and rustproofing of various types of arrows, daggers, darts, scrolls. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 12:22, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

== Do artifacts' luck bonus stack with luckstones? ==

The article on luckstones isn't very clear about that. I'm playing SLASH'EM and got myself a couple uncursed luckstones, although I already have a blessed Deluder in my inventory. Is there any point in blessing and carrying one of those luckstones in my knapsack (other than having a spare in case the Deluder is cursed), or are they better off in my container? {{unsigned|Vicius|11 June 2009}}

== missing stairs. ==

hi, I am a new nethack player, and many times, when I start a new game, the stairs in one of the levels dissappear! usually that level will be very small, and I always keep looking for secret doors, but to no avail.

is this a bug, or am I missing something?

: There are only nine levels in the game with no stairs down (quest end, mine's end, castle, vibrating square, endgame levels), and it is highly unlikely a newbie is seeing them often. Perhaps there is an object on the stairs, including boulders, or a sessile monster. It is very unusual for the rooms in an ordinary rooms and corridor level not to be spread out evenly over the entire screen, so keep looking. You need to be adjacent to a secret door in order to [[search]] successfully. Another option is to dig, either into the unexplored area, or down and walk back up. 

: We should have a tutorial on this wiki how to deal with missing stairs, complete with example maps and where to search first. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 08:25, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

== Resolving resolution woes. ==

Hello, I've just recently started playing Nethack and I've come across something very troubling. My monitor dwarfs the ASCII used for NetHack.exe. I've found that using the 8 - ASCII 12x16 / Fit to Screen feature in the NetHackW.exe remedies this problem, however, every time I reopen it (I die a lot, as you can imagine), I have to do the same two-step (not too keen on deselecting the default random function for every aspect of character creation either).
