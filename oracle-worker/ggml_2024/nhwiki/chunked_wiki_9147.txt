Didn't work.[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 02:56, 14 November 2010 (UTC)

:You could try it with <nowiki>{{<includeonly>safesubst:</includeonly>REVISIONUSER}}</nowiki> etc., but I don't think that's going to work: it'll just show ''your'' username and the time ''you'' edited the page.  I don't think MediaWiki has any parser function to get information about the ''previous'' editor.  I suppose one could be written, though.  (It probably wouldn't be quite as useful on busy wikis, but you're right, here there's a good chance that whoever left the comment was the previous editor.)  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 03:16, 14 November 2010 (UTC)}

This [[patch]] adds a config [[option]] to always show [[BUC]] status if it is known. By default, "[[uncursed]]" is never shown to [[priest]]s, or to anybody for [[items]] with known [[charge]]s or [[enchantment]].

/*
 * MediaWiki AJAX login script.
 * This script uses jQuery UI and MediaWiki API to display an on-page login dialog

 *
 * This is still an early version, and not all bugs have been worked out yet.
 * Known bugs and issues include:
 *  - There is no way to select if you want to log in permanently or for this
 *    browser session only, it's always permanent.  The MediaWiki API doesn't
 *    currently provide any way to change that, and since the *Token cookie is
 *    HTTPOnly, it can't even be cleared by javascript.
 *  - There's no localization, and the dialog text is hardcoded (except for the
 *    site name).  We should use an API query to load the text.
 *  - There is no "e-mail new password" button.  Worked around by providing a
 *    link to the non-AJAX upload form.
 *  - Username/password autocompletion works spottily if at all.  Need to figure
 *    out how to trigger it reliably.

In SLASH'EM, a '''severed hand''' is generally only seen as the [[base item]] for [[the Hand of Vecna]]. It has strong parallels with an [[eyeball]]. It is not randomly generated, but you can find a normal one in a [[bones]] level, or you can even [[wish]] for one.

The game will always ask for confirmation if one attempts to eat a severed hand ("Are you sure you want to eat that? [ynq] (n)"), as eating any [[artifact]] severed hand{{refsrc|eat.c|2128|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} will do 150-199 damage. However, the only artifact severed hand is the [[Hand of Vecna]]. When eaten, a severed hand gives 40 nutrition points with the message: "This severed hand is delicious!". Oddly enough, it isn't considered cannibalism to eat one, it's just meat. A non-[[Hand of Vecna]] severed hand can't be sacrificed.

An '''eyeball''' is a [[SLASH'EM]] [[comestible]] that serves as the [[base item]] for the [[Eye of the Beholder]]. It has strong parallels with a [[severed hand]]. It is not randomly generated, but you can find a normal one in a [[bones]] level if you already have the Eye of the Beholder, or you can even [[wish]] for one.

Since eating any [[artifact]] eyeball does 150-199 damage{{refsrc|eat.c|2118|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}, the game will always ask for confirmation upon attempting to eat one("Are you sure you want to eat that? [ynq] (n)"). However, the only artifact eyeball in the game is the [[Eye of the Beholder]]. When eaten, an eyeball gives 10 nutrition points with the message: "This eyeball is delicious!". In contrast to the Eye of the Beholder, an eyeball can't be sacrificed.

The '''locust''' is a new [[monster]] that appears in [[SporkHack]] and [[UnNetHack]]. They are notable for their [[disease]] attack.

==Strategy==
If you encounter these before you have a [[unicorn horn]], then [[Elbereth]] may help to avoid being hit; if you have no means of curing disease in your inventory, be prepared to pray after fighting these. Late in the game, these may be summoned by [[aligned priest]]s who cast [[summon insects]]; your [[AC]] should be low enough by then to dodge the majority of locust attacks, so the unicorn horn remains a sufficient way to cure their disease.

==Encyclopedia entry (UnNetHack) ==
{{encyclopedia|
	A minute invertebrate animal; one of the class _Insecta_. The
	true insects or hexapods have the body divided into a head,
	a thorax of 3 segments, each of which bears a pair of legs,
	and an abdomen of 7 to 11 segments, and in development usually
	pass through a metamorphosis. There are usually 2 pairs of wings,
	sometimes one pair or none.
		[ Webster's Comprehensive International Dictionary 
		  of the English Language ]

	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will 
	I bring the locusts into thy coast:
	And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able
	to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is 
	escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every
	tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
	And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants,
	and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor
	thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the
	earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
		|[ Exodus, 10:4-6 ]

If monsters [[Monster magic resistance|resist the attack]], the damage is cut in half.

[[Intelligent]] [[monster]]s will use these wands on you.

{{patch
 |name=xlogfile
 |author=Aardvark Joe
 |bilious=289
}}

'''xlogfile''', or the extended [[logfile]], is a [[compile-time option]] for NetHack that makes the game log more data at the end of a game than is stored by default in the regular [[logfile]]

The xlogfile began as a [[patch]] for [[NetHack 3.4.3]]. It was incorporated into the mainline in [[NetHack 3.6.0]]. It is an optional feature, enabled by default, and can be removed by commenting out the definition of XLOGFILE in include/config.h.

== File format ==

The data is saved into a file named <code>xlogfile</code> in the same directory as the normal logfile. Each line contains several <tt>field=value</tt> pairs, delimited by tabs. For example:
 version=3.6.3	points=972	deathdnum=0	deathlev=4	maxlvl=5	hp=0	maxhp=48	deaths=1	deathdate=20191206	birthdate=20191206	uid=5	role=Val	race=Hum	gender=Fem	align=Law	name=merpish	death=killed by a water elemental	conduct=0xf80	turns=3711	achieve=0x0	realtime=708	starttime=1575647272	endtime=1575647980	gender0=Fem	align0=Law	flags=0x4

In the original patch, fields are delimited by colons.

Most of the fields are self-explanatory, or are the same as in the normal [[logfile]]. Exceptions are:

*[[conduct]]: A bitfield in hexadecimal format:
**0x001: [[Foodless]]
**0x002: Vegan
**0x004: Vegetarian
**0x008: [[Atheist]]
**0x010: [[Never hit with a wielded weapon|Weaponless]]
**0x020: [[Pacifist]]
**0x040: [[Illiterate]]
**0x080: Polypileless
**0x100: Polyselfless
**0x200: [[Wishless]]
**0x400: Artifact wishless
**0x800: Genocideless
*achieve: A bitfield in hexadecimal format:
**0x0001: Got the [[Bell of Opening]]
**0x0002: Entered [[Gehennom]]
**0x0004: Got the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]]
**0x0008: Got the [[Book of the Dead]]
**0x0010: Performed the [[Invocation]]
**0x0020: Got the [[Amulet of Yendor]]
**0x0040: Was in the [[End Game]]
**0x0080: Was on the [[Astral Plane]]
**0x0100: Ascended
**0x0200: Got the [[Luckstone]] at [[Mines' End]]
**0x0400: Finished [[Sokoban]]
**0x0800: Killed [[Medusa]]
**0x1000: [[Zen]] conduct intact
**0x2000: [[Nudist]] conduct intact
*realtime: How long the game was, in seconds.
*starttime and endtime: Seconds since [[wikipedia:UNIX Epoch|UNIX Epoch]].
*gender0: The original (starting) [[gender]].
*align0: The original (starting) [[alignment]].
*death: All colons are replaced with underscores, otherwise the same as in the normal logfile.
*flags: A bitfield in hexadecimal format:{{reffunc|topten.c|encodexlogflags}}
**0x1: [[Wizard mode]]
**0x2: [[Discover mode]]
**0x4: Never loaded a [[Bones]] file

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The fields <code>conductX</code> and <code>achieveX</code> are added that encode conducts and game achievements in text form, allowing for easier addition of new conducts and achievements and making the file easier to read by humans.}}

A cockatoo is a new domestic monster in [[SLASH'EM]].  It can be tamed with [[vegan]] food, but it does not make a terribly good pet. Although comparable to a [[kitten]] or [[little dog]], it cannot [[grow up]].

It cannot fly, strangely enough.  Do not displace it into water or lava!

==Sounds==

Cockatoos share with [[parrot]]s an interesting array of sounds when #chatted to; see that article for more information.

A parrot is a monster introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].  It can be tamed with [[vegan]] food. It is slightly better in combat than a [[large dog]], but cannot be [[growing up|reared from a smaller form]].  Due to what may be an oversight, it does not fly: do not displace it into water or lava!

==Sounds==
Parrots (as well as [[cockatoo]]s) have some interesting things to say.  Chatting with them produces one of the following messages:

 <monster> squaarks louldly!<ref>It is misspelled in the source code, see [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/sounds.c#line664]]</ref>
 <monster> says 'Polly want a lembas wafer!'

 <monster> says 'Show us yer knickers!'
 <monster> says 'You'll never make it!'
 <monster> whistles suggestively!
 <monster> says 'What sort of a sword do you call that!'

A '''pit bull''' is a [[domestic]] monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is similar to a [[large dog]], but considerably stronger.
==Strategy==
While having a stronger dog is nice, by the time these animals appear you will probably want an even better pet.  Like most domestic animals in SLASH'EM, pit bulls are [[Need +x weapon to hit|unable to hurt a large variety of monsters]], since they hit as a +0 weapon.

They are quite capable however in killing a priest that you might want to keep alive.

A dingo puppy is a new monster in [[SLASH'EM]].  Aside from not being a [[domestic animal]], it is identical to a [[little dog]].  If you do manage to tame one, it can grow up to become a [[dingo]], and eventually a [[large dingo]].

==Strategy==
While not a huge threat, these can extinguish some of the weaker starting roles in SLASH'EM.  [[Ranged weapon]]s are advised if you are low on HP.

The '''NeXTSTEP tiles''' is a recreation of a tileset used on a NeXTSTEP system. This tileset can be used with NetHack 3.4.3. The tiles are 10x10 pixels in size.

The NeXTSTEP NetHack used one image per monster symbol, so eg. all [[ant]]s get one image, all [[blob]]s get another, and so on. The images have parts which are colored on the fly to make the distinction between different tiles.

The newest version of NetHack for NeXTSTEP is v3.0i, so some new tiles had to be drawn from scratch.

The original graphical NeXT port was done by Christoph Marquardt, and this new tileset was recreated from those tiles by [[User:Paxed]].

Large dingos are probably not a threat by the time one encounters them.  They are not worth taming generally, as SLASH'EM provides plenty of domestic animals to tame which are stronger.

A '''death dog''' is a new type of [[canine]] appearing in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is only generated in [[Gehennom]].  Despite its name, it lacks any special abilities or resistances.
==Strategy==
Death dogs do a large amount of damage for a creature with only two hit dice.  However, since they only appear in [[Gehennom]], they are unlikely to kill many players.  Be sure not to get surrounded, as they do tend to appear in groups.

A '''rabid wolf''' is a new monster in [[SLASH'EM]].  They have slightly more hitpoints than regular [[wolf|wolves]], and their bite is [[poisonous]].
==Strategy==
These are not a huge threat, since they are no faster than a normal player.  Take them down with [[ranged weapon]]s if you lack [[poison resistance]] and/or [[magic cancellation]], since their bite does have the potential to cause [[instadeath]].
Unlike [[rabid rat]]s, the corpses of rabid wolves are safe to eat, and in fact provide a decent amount of [[nutrition]].

A '''wolverine''' is a relatively strong canid introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].
==Strategy==
Like its real-world counterpart, SLASH'EM's wolverines are capable of inflicting surprisingly large amounts of damage.  Be careful when you see one, for they do inflict rather more damage than monsters that start appearing around the same time.  Fortunately, they lack any [[resistance]]s: [[charm monster]] is guaranteed to work, and [[poison]] may instakill them.
