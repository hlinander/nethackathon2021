Some scrolls require certain conditions to be met.  If they aren't, you see the message "you feel a strange sense of loss".

In Rogue 3.6.3 and in the DOS version, there is only one universal identify scroll.

Rogue 3.6.3 and the DOS version both have a scroll of blank paper.  (This is essentially a "scroll of nothing", called S_NOP in the source.)  The Scroll of Protect Armor is not present in these versions.

Rogue 3.6.3 has a Scroll of Light, which lights a room, and a Scroll of Genocide, which prompts the player to select a monster letter to remove from the game.  There is a Scroll of Gold Detection, instead of Food Detection.

The DOS version has a Scroll of Vorpalize Weapon.  This makes the currently wielded weapon do +4, +4 against a randomly selected monster.  Vorpalized weapons can also be zapped, and will always kill the target enemy in one hit, but will only alert other enemies.  Attempting to vorpalize a weapon twice destroys it.  To select the enemy the weapon is vorpal against, the game starts from the most difficult monsters and works down, with a 10% chance of selecting each monster.  If no monster is selected, "M" (Medusa) is defaulted to.

|}

The rings that provide bonuses may either give +1 or +2, but can also be cursed and give -1 instead.

Version 3.6.3 does not have a Ring of Maintain Armor, but the DOS version does.

== Rods ==

Rods can either be wands or staffs.  While there are differences between them, they are minor.

{|class="wikitable"

Staves normally appear with 3-7 charges.

In version 3.6.3 and the DOS version, there is no Wand of Invisibility.  These versions have a Wand/Staff of Striking instead, which normally does 2d8 + 4 damage, or it has a 5% chance of doing 3d8 + 9 damage.

There are two types of shirt in NetHack: the '''T-shirt''' and the '''Hawaiian shirt'''. Both are functionally identical.

0.2% of all randomly generated armor items are T-shirts, while 0.8% are Hawaiian shirts.

A '''T-shirt''' is the first of the two shirts. T-shirts can be [[read]]. If you go shopping when wearing a T-shirt and the [[shopkeeper]] sees it (i.e., there is no [[body armor]] or [[cloak]] over it), he will charge an extra 1/3 markup and buy things for 1/3 of the base price.

Reading a T-shirt will display a message. The message is dependent on the item's object ID, so it will remain consistent for any one T-shirt.{{refsrc|read.c|181|nethack=3.6.1}} If the shirt is [[erosion|eroded]], some of the text might be altered, just as an [[engraving]] would be.{{refsrc|read.c|182|nethack=3.6.1}} Reading a T-shirt breaks the illiterate [[conduct]].

===History===
The t-shirt was added as an item in [[NetHack 3.2.0]] in April 1996.

The extra T-shirt messages were added in [[NetHack 3.4.0]] from a [http://www.killerbunnies.org/nethack/3.3.1/tshirt.diff patch by Scott Bigham]. Previously, the only messages were:{{refsrc|read.c|86|version=NetHack 3.3.0}}

{{message|"I explored the Dungeons of Doom, and never did any laundry..."|if hallucinating and currently wearing the T-shirt}}
{{message|"I explored the Dungeons of Doom, and couldn't find my way out"|if hallucinating and not currently wearing the T-shirt}}
{{message|"I explored the Dungeons of Doom, but all I got was this lousy T-shirt"|otherwise}}

Pasi Kallinen and Pat Rankin added more messages in [[NetHack 3.6.0]] and [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

==Hawaiian shirt==
{{armor
  |color=magenta
  |name=Hawaiian shirt
  |slot=shirt
  |ac=0
  |special=<ul><li>[[shop]] markup</li></ul>
  |cost=3
  |weight=5
  |material=cloth
}}

All [[Tourist]]s start with a +0 Hawaiian shirt.

If you go shopping when wearing a Hawaiian shirt and the [[shopkeeper]] sees it (i.e., there is no [[body armor]] or [[cloak]] over it), he will charge an extra 1/3 markup and buy things for 1/3 of the base price.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Reading a Hawaiian shirt will print its design.}}

==Strategy==
Shirts are not valuable in the early game before obtaining protection from [[polymorph trap]]s, since they will be destroyed if you polymorph into a large form. It may be better to enchant other armor items instead, like a helm, boots, or gloves.

Later in the game when most of your gear is fully enchanted and you have [[magic resistance]] to protect from polymorph traps, shirts can provide a useful AC bonus if enchanted.

Those not averse to [[polypiling]] should also note that a shirt is non-magical and is therefore fairly easy to obtain by [[polymorph]]ing a large pile of [[armor]] objects (try [[The Castle]] or [[Fort Ludios]]). See the table below for a breakdown of probabilities of success from polypiling.

The armor storeroom in the [[Castle]] level, which has fourteen randomly selected armors, makes for a significant 13.13% chance of having either a Hawaiian or normal T-shirt. The random general store items in [[Orcus Town]] may also produce a shirt.

A Hawaiian shirt in a [[bones]] pile is a strong indicator that the deceased was a Tourist.

==Variants==
Other [[variant]]s add new types of shirts.

=== Convict patch ===
The '''[[striped shirt]]''' is worn by [[Convict]]s. It is thus present in [[UnNetHack]], [[DynaHack]], [[dNetHack]], [[EvilHack]], [[SpliceHack]], and [[SlashTHEM]].

===dNetHack===

In [[dNetHack]], the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Ruffled shirt|ruffled shirt]] grants a +1 bonus to [[charisma]] and can be enchanted to raise [[AC]] like any other shirt. [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Victorian underwear|Victorian underwear]] grants a charisma bonus of +2 and [[MC]] 3 (maximum magic cancellation), at the cost of a -2 penalty to AC and reduction of the AC bonus from [[dexterity]].

The '''[[Anachrononaut#Bodyglove|bodyglove]]''' is [[Anachrononaut#Future tech|future tech]] available to [[Anachrononaut]]s.

dNetHack also includes the '''[[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack_Items#Underclothes|black dress]]''', which is worn by female drow nobles.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], if [[the Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers]] is generated (50%), then it has a guaranteed two Hawaiian shirts, from the two guaranteed [[Tourist (player monster)|tourists]].

===SlashTHEM===
In SlashTHEM, the ruffled shirt behaves as an ordinary shirt, with no unusual bonuses or penalties. The Victorian underwear grants MC3&mdash;making it the "shirt" with the highest MC in the game&mdash;at the cost of an AC penalty. SlashTHEM also adds the '''[[expensive suit]]''' from the obsolete variant [[NetHack--]] for Undertakers.

===SpliceHack===
[[SpliceHack]] adds two shirt-slot armors, the '''dress''' and the '''tuxedo''', but these don't have any special effects.

==Encyclopedia entry==
===Hawaiian shirt===
{{encyclopedia|
'One of the things he can't do, he can't ride a horse,' he
said.  Then he stiffened as if sandbagged by a sudden
recollection, gave a small yelp of terror and dashed into
the gloom.  When he returned, the being called Twoflower was
hanging limply over his shoulder.  It was small and skinny,
and dressed very oddly in a pair of knee-length britches and
a shirt in such a violent and vivid conflict of colours that
the Weasel's fastidious eye was offended even in the half-light.

The two most valued varieties are the [[mithril-coat]] in the early game and [[dragon scale mail]] as part of an [[ascension kit]]. Neither of these can be corroded or otherwise damaged, and they provide an excellent AC reduction for their weight. The only problem with the mithril-coat is that it impedes spellcasting.

==Dragon scale mail==
The single most valued item of body armor is [[dragon scale mail]]. For 40 weight, it reduces your AC by 9, provides a useful [[extrinsic]] [[property]] (depending on the color of [[dragon]] it came from), and does not corrode or impede spellcasting. The two most coveted varieties of dragon scale mail are [[gray dragon scale mail|gray]], which provides [[magic resistance]], and [[silver dragon scale mail|silver]], which gives [[reflection]].

==Strategy==
While body armor is often heavy, it can provide a significant boost to your AC. The most desirable body armor in the early game is a [[mithril-coat]], which is relatively light and gives a good AC bonus.

|The Oracle's room, with [[fountain]]s and centaur [[statue]]s.
|}

There are five rooms to the sides of the above area, with two separate rooms containing the [[stairs]]. Five random [[monster]]s, three random [[trap]]s, and six random [[item]]s are placed around the level, and the rooms are linked to each other and to the above room by corridors. Each room has one trap, except the rooms with two objects or the up stairs. The Oracle is at the center of the three-by-three room (called Delphi), amid the [[fountain]]s; there is a random empty [[doorway]] in one [[wall]]. There are two random monsters generated in the area surrounding Delphi. The marked [[statue]]s are:

* two [[forest centaur]]s (northwest and southeast)
* two [[mountain centaur]]s (northeast and southwest)
* four [[plains centaur]]s (north, west, south, and east).

If any of the centaur flavors are genocided or extinct, those statues will be replaced with statues of random creatures.

The statues are considered historic, and thus yield an [[Alignment record|alignment]] penalty if they are broken by an [[Archeologist]]. The statues also have a chance of containing a random [[spellbook]].

The Oracle, {{monsym|oracle}}, is a [[human]] that is completely [[sessile]], and always generates [[peaceful]].

While she has no active attacks of her own, attacking her in melee causes a spray of magic missiles to hit you;{{refsrc|uhitm.c|2377|nethack=3.6.0}} the passive magic missile attack is not implemented for inter-monster combat. Due to the magic missile attack, the Oracle has [[magic resistance]] and is thus immune to magic missiles and rays from a [[wand of death]] or the [[finger of death]] spell.

===Consultations===
The Oracle offers two services, both of which cost money. Minor consultations are simply true [[rumor]]s, much like you can get from a blessed [[fortune cookie]]. A major consultation is an extended description of some aspect of the game, for example:

 Behold the [[cockatrice]], whose diminutive stature belies its hidden might.  The  
 cockatrice can [[stoning|petrify]] any ordinary being it contacts--save those wise  
 adventurers who eat a dead [[lizard]] or [[acid blob|blob of acid]] when they feel themselves  
 slowly turning to stone.

The first major and the first minor consultation you buy each increases your [[score]]{{refsrc|rumors.c|543|nethack=3.6.0}} and gives [[experience points]].{{refsrc|rumors.c|525|nethack=3.6.0}} Buying a consultation of a type you've already bought gives neither experience nor score. If you take a major consultation, but do not have enough money to pay for it, the Oracle will take all your money and give a special oracularity which refers to [[wikipedia:Oracle machine|Oracle machines]]; this will "use up" the experience points gain for major consultations.

If the Oracle is attacked by you or else killed by any means, you will not have access to consultations for the rest of that game.

===Lists of consultations===
The Oracle's consultations are stored in plain text in the source code:

* [[List of major consultations]] from [[Source:NetHack 3.6.1/dat/oracles.txt|dat/oracles.txt]]
* [[List of rumors]] from [[Source:NetHack 3.6.1/dat/rumors.tru|dat/rumors.tru]]
{{clear}}

==Strategy==
The presence of [[naga hatchling]]s and [[baby dragon]]s on a level typically indicates that you have found the Oracle level.

Those looking to dispose of the Oracle for whatever reason (e.g. [[extinctionist]] [[conduct]]) can kill her with ranged attacks without any retaliation, but this will incur [[murder]] penalties for non-[[chaotic]] characters. Due to the fact her magic missile passive does not apply to monsters, any pet at level 11 or higher can attack the Oracle and may kill her.

Be mindful of having enough for a major consultation when leveling a [[pacifist]] character - additionally, if you have obtained a powerful pet early on, be sure to keep it well away from the Oracle for the above reasons if you have not yet obtained any consultations.

==History==
The Oracle first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Pythia}}
{{wikipedia|Internet Oracle}}
The Oracle is primarily based on the [[wikipedia:Pythia|Pythia]], the priestess who presided over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi; the ''NetHack'' Oracle will welcome you to "Delphi" when she spots you arriving at her abode.

The [[#Messages|Oracle-level sound effects]] reference several different oracles - the "strange wind" alludes to the Oracle of Jupiter at Dodona; "conclusive ravings" refers to the Oracle of Apollo; and "snoring snakes" is derived from the Oracle of Aesculapius at Epidaurus. The two additional [[hallucination]] sounds both reference the Internet Oracle from [news://rec.humor.oracle rec.humor.oracle], which first appeared in 1989, particularly the taboo question ''"How much wood would a [[woodchuck]] chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"'' The Oracle was added to ''NetHack'' the same year.

==Messages==
{{message|You hear a strange wind.<br>You hear convulsive ravings.<br>You hear snoring snakes.|The Oracle is present on the level.}}
{{message|You hear someone say "No more woodchucks!"<br>You hear a loud ZOT!|As above, while hallucinating.}}

==Variants==
Many variants enable the Oracle's passive attack to be used against other monsters.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the Oracle is able to use her passive attack on other monsters. If a [[woodchuck]] attacks the Oracle, the message associated with the attack is "ZOT!"{{refsrc|mhitm.c|1989|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], [[woodchuck]]s will attack the Oracle on sight as part of Nephi's [[grudge]] patch, and the Oracle is able to use her passive attack on other monsters.

UnNetHack also makes a few minor adjustments to the Oracle level. The level is generated with 1 guaranteed woodchuck, and monster generation is slightly tweaked. 93% of monsters are generated by the normal mechanism; the remaining 7% of monsters generated are according to the following probabilities:
* 30% random {{mcsl|i}}
* 10% {{monsymlink|woodchuck}}s
* 10% {{monsymlink|floating eye}}s
* 10% {{monsymlink|wererat}}s
* 10% {{monsymlink|yellow light}}s
* 10% random {{mcsl|u}}
* 10% random {{mcsl|r}}
* 10% random {{mcsl|n}}

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], the Oracle can grant [[enlightenment]] at a price equal to 20 times your [[experience level]] in gold.

===FIQhack===
In [[FIQhack]], the Oracle provides enlightenment similar to Fourk.

===xNetHack===
[[xNetHack]] adds two other variations of the room in the center of the Oracle level. In both of them, the Oracle sits amid a ring of [[pool]]s instead of a smaller room. One variant has many [[tree]]s and only three fountains; the other has statues of snakes, nagas, sea monsters and elementals. The Oracle herself has many new consultations, and also a {{frac|2|3}} chance of generating with a [[potion of hallucination]] - this is another allusion to the shrine at Delphi, which had chemical vapors emitting from a spring-made cleft that is speculated to have induced "prophetic" trances.

Like UnNetHack, woodchucks and the Oracle attack each other on sight.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the Oracle can use her passive attack on other monsters. Additionally, she holds an artifact [[tool]] known as the [[Magic 8-Ball]], which divulges rumors based on its [[beatitude]] and is implied to be the source of her knowledge.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/v0.7.1/include/artilist.h#L216 EvilHack 0.7.1 include/artilist.h, line 216]</ref>

The Oracle's consultations are one of the many possible sources of [[Elbereth]] for a character. Her magic missile passive attack no longer has its damage negated via magic resistance; [[half spell damage]] still reduces its damage output, and [[reflection]] will only partially reduce its damage.

===SpliceHack===
[[SpliceHack]] adds the new Delphi variations from xNetHack, but the pools have a small chance of being replaced with lava<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/dat/oracle-2.lua</ref><ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/dat/oracle-3.lua</ref>. The original Delphi variation from vanilla NetHack is changed to have different statues<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/dat/oracle-1.lua</ref>:

* {{frac|2|3}} chance of [[centaur]] statues
* {{frac|1|12}} chance of [[manticore]] statues
* {{frac|1|12}} chance of [[chimera]] statues
* {{frac|1|12}} chance of [[quadruped]] statues
* {{frac|1|24}} chance of [[woodchuck]] statues
* {{frac|1|24}} chance of [[archaeologist]] statues

===dNetHack===
[[dNetHack]] includes more options for consultations for the Oracle, including [[enlightenment]] (costing 200+20*level) and so-called "glimpses of things to come" (costing 150) hints as to some randomized aspects of the dungeon.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Delphi under towering Parnassus, where Apollo's oracle was,
plays an important part in mythology.  Castalia was its
sacred spring; Cephissus its river.  It was held to be the
center of the world, so many pilgrims came to it, from
foreign countries as well as Greece.  No other shrine rivaled
it.  The answers to the questions asked by the anxious
seekers for Truth were delivered by a priestess who went into
a trance before she spoke.

A '''mummy wrapping''' is a type of makeshift [[cloak]] item that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. 

== Generation ==

It has a high chance to be dropped (86%) when you kill any kind of [[mummy]].

==Effects==
When worn, the mummy wrapping provides no base AC, but has an [[MC]] of 1 and it negates [[invisibility]].

== Strategy ==

The main use of a mummy wrapping is to allow yourself to enter [[shop]]s when you have the [[invisibility]] [[intrinsic]] (otherwise the shopkeeper will not let you in).  Once inside the shop, you may remove the mummy wrapping, but you will need to wear it again to leave.

Another use for the mummy wrapping is to lure [[wraith]]s off certain levels where they are less likely to leave corpses; such levels include any level with a [[graveyard]], the [[Castle]], [[Medusa's Island]], the four [[demon]] lairs, and the levels with the [[Wizard's Tower]]. Be aware that MC 1 is not good protection against level drain; it is a good idea to switch back to your main cloak when you are ready to fight the wraith.

They are the weakest of all [[cloak]]s, but also the lightest. With MC of just 1 and AC 0, they match dwarven cloaks and nearly match leather cloaks and even some magic cloaks if you don't need the magic effect. At least they can protect underlying armor from [[corrosion]]. Sometimes they can be highly enchanted. So in the early game, it might worth testing them. You might end up having difficulty choosing between a +5 mummy wrapping or one of the magic cloaks at +0 or +1.

==Origin==

These, of course, are the well known mummy wrappings of Egyptian mummies. Other types of mummies don't have them.

As mentioned in the encyclopedia entry, the power to negate invisibility is a reference to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man book] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man_(film) film] [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024184/ ''The Invisible Man''], in which the (invisible) man wraps bandages around him to overcome his invisibility.

==Encyclopaedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
He held a white cloth -- it was a serviette he had brought
with him -- over the lower part of his face, so that his
mouth and jaws were completely hidden, and that was the
reason for his muffled voice.  But it was not that which
startled Mrs. Hall.  It was the fact that all his forehead
above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and
that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his
face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.  It was
bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.  He
wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-
lined collar turned up about his neck.  The thick black
hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross
bandages, project in curious tails and horns, giving him
the strangest appearance conceivable.

{{trap

 |effect=Transports between branches
}}

A '''magic portal''', {{purple|^}}, is a type of [[trap]] that takes you to a different [[branch]] of the dungeon.

==Generation==
Portals are never randomly generated. They can be found:
* In a [[vault]] between dungeon level 11 and [[Medusa]], leading to [[Fort Ludios]].
* In the entrance to the [[Wizard's Tower]] in [[Gehennom]].
* In a normal dungeon room, leading to the [[Quest]].
* Somewhere on each of the [[Elemental Planes]] leading to the next.

Single-use portals are also technically generated when the [[Eye of the Aethiopica]] is used to [[branchport]] between dungeon branches, although you never get to see them.

=== Wizard mode ===
In [[wizard mode]], magic portals can be wished for. Stepping on them causes you to [[Escaping the dungeon|escape the dungeon]], ending the game immediately, with no option to continue the game.

==Effects==
Note that unlike the teleport trap and level teleporter, a portal will transport you even if you have [[magic resistance]].

A magic portal is always activated when you move onto its square. The Fort Ludios, Wizard's Tower and Quest portals transport you onto a corresponding return portal. While standing on the portal, it will be activated if you [[Sit|#sit]], provided there are no objects on the ground.
<ref>{{sourcecode|trap.c|1178}} (Magic portal on you) and {{sourcecode|trap.c|1989}} (On monsters)</ref>

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Using a magic portal causes you to be stunned for three turns.}}

==Removal==
This trap cannot be removed, although the portal to your [[quest]] disappears if you are rejected with prejudice.

==Strategy==
To find the portals, see [[Portal detection methods]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Portals can be Mirrors, Pictures, Standing Stones, Stone
Circles, Windows, and special gates set up for the purpose.
You will travel through them both to distant parts of the
continent and to and from our own world.  The precise manner
of their working is a Management secret.

The '''caret ^''' has a few purposes:
* A {{white|^}} on the screen represents a [[trap]], including the quest portal if on the rogue level.
* Press {{kbd|^}} for the [[trap_id]] command.
* {{kbd|^}} is the default for the [[menu_first_page]] option.  Supported by [[tty]] and [[curses interface]]s, see [[menu controls]].

The caret is also used as a prefix to denote a control character; for example, use [[P|'''^P''' (control-p)]] to review previous messages. This is a standard [[UNIX]] usage that's also used by the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] text-mode interfaces.

&&%s&& %s Spelling {99308 2015-12-21T16:40:47Z {4000080 ChasonBot}  NetHack demands accurate '''spelling''' skills of its users most of the time, but occasionally it can be forgiving. For example, typing "''grey'' dragon scale mail" (like one would do in the UK) and "''gray'' dragon scale mail" (the US spelling) when prompted for a [[wish]] will yield the same item. There are several other items which will admit varied spellings:{{reffunc|objnam.c|struct_alt_spellings}}

* [[pick-axe]] / pick axe / pickaxe / pickax
* [[silver saber]] / silver sabre
* [[armor]] / armour
* [[Croesus]] / Kroisos
* [[T-shirt]] / tee-shirt

The plural of some entities of non-English or unusual origin is the same as the singular:{{refsrc|objnam.c|1328}}

* [[Samurai]]
* [[ya]]
* [[ninja]]
* [[ronin]]
* [[shito]]
* [[shuriken]]
* [[tengu]]
* [[manes]]
* [[ki-rin]]
* [[gunyoki]]

Many plurals are irregular.  While most of these will be familiar to English speakers, there are a few which may not be:

* [[djinni]] -> djinn (from Arabic)
* [[mumak]] -> mumakil (from Elvish)

The latter case might be relevant to those wishing to genocide mumakil (djinn cannot be genocided).

Interestingly, the game will attempt to pluralize correctly many words which do not normally appear in-game.  In vanilla NetHack, such words will only be seen as fruit names. The game even accounts for such odd choices of name as "lotus" or even "child."{{refsrc|objnam.c|1452}}

Press '''{{kbd|.}}''' when asked for a direction, such as when zapping a wand, to direct your action at yourself.

The '''rest''' command does nothing for one turn. By default, it is mapped to the {{kbd|.}} key. There is an option to [[rest_on_space|rest when space]] is pressed, but this is not considered desirable.

Multi-turn resting with a [[numeric prefix]] will stop when hit points or power have returned to their maximum values.

==Strategy==
Normally, resting does not provide any extra benefits or speed up hit point and power regeneration; however, if you are [[burdened]] or worse, resting lets you wait at your unburdened speed. This additionally allows your hit points to regenerate even if your status is stressed or worse. Game time continues to run while you rest, so be wary of holding the key down.

In some situations, [[search]]ing may be a preferable alternative—it can exercise wisdom if you find a hidden [[trap]] or [[secret door|door]], but unlike resting the amount of time it takes is proportional to your load. Searching is ideal if you are restoring health in a safe area between battles and can become unburdened; if you are transporting heavy items, such as moving a corpse to an altar, and are waiting for a pet to move, resting is the better option. Other alternatives include pushing [[boulder|boulders]] to exercise strength, re-reading [[spellbook|spellbooks]] for known spells to exercise wisdom, etc.
