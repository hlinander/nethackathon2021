The '''wooden stake''' is a starting item for the [[Undead Slayer]] in [[SLASH'EM]]. [[The Stake of Van Helsing]] is an artifact wooden stake.

A stake does 1d6 extra damage to any [[vampire]], with additional 2 damage and 10% chance to [[instakill]] if one of the following applies:
you are an [[Undead Slayer]], you have Expert [[skill|proficiency]] in dagger, or the stake is the aforementioned artifact.

&&%s&& %s Falcon's Eye {73238 2011-09-19T06:46:14Z {831 Tjr} bold superseded [[Image:Falconseye.png|thumb|right|A screenshot.]]
'''Falcon's Eye''' was an isometric [[GUI]] for [[NetHack]], based on version [[NetHack 3.3.1|3.3.1]]. Plans to adapt it to version [[NetHack 3.4.0|3.4.0]] were announced on its webpage, but never completed, along with an announced Falcon's Claw project, applying Falcon's Eye's GUI to [[SLASH'EM]]. 

This project has been '''superseded by [[Vulture|Vulture's Eye]]''', which expanded to encompass SLASH'EM and [[UnNetHack]].

It featured comparatively lavish graphics if compared to ASCII or even tiles mode, music, and mouse-driven gameplay, including a sort of [[Far_look|far look]] command via tooltip, keyboard play being still possible.

Falcon's Eye rotates the map by 45 degrees, meaning that the 'north' direction in ASCII/tiles becomes 'northwest' in Falcon's Eye.

The project was abandoned sometime after 2005.

Its web site is still live at http://falconseye.sourceforge.net/

&&%s&& %s /dev/null/nethack tournament {149110 2022-11-30T18:12:00Z {4000867 K2} /* Results */ fix link to the NetHack Scoreboard The '''/dev/null/nethack tournament''', also known as the '''devnull tournament''', was the second longest running gaming tournament on the Internet, having run every November since 1999.<ref>The first is Myth World Cup which began in 1998.</ref> The tournament's main website was at http://nethack.devnull.net. It ran from midnight Pacific Time (PDT with the new extended Daylight Savings Time in the USA), 1 November (Halloween night) until midnight PT, 1 December.

During this time, players competed for a wide range of trophies ranging from simple stars for reaching in-game goals shy of ascension to trophies for impressive multi-ascension feats.

The competition was in vanilla NetHack, with custom patches applied to provide a new optional challenge each year (except 2011 and 2013). The old challenges (going back to 2005) were all available (except for the Kingdom Of Loathing challenge, which was broken by changes to the external website it depended on). The new challenge's identity was kept secret to make things more interesting for the players. Apart from that, no features or fixes were added, so beware of splitting [[long worm]]s.

In September 2017 the tournament organizer Krystal [https://twitter.com/devnull_nethack/status/908441635746279424 announced] on Twitter that it would be retired for good. An independent group of players held a final [[Devnull Tribute|tribute tournament]] in the tournament's usual timeslot, running all the usual challenges but updated to [[NetHack 3.6.0]] (rather than the version that was used for Krystal's tournaments, [[NetHack 3.4.3]]).  In keeping with tradition, the tournament ran on the (mostly) unpatched NetHack release, allowing (encouraging?) players to exploit various known bugs to their advantage. So, even though the [[astral call bug]] was no longer available, 3.6.0 had plenty of new material to offer in this space. From 2018 onwards, a new tournament, [[The November NetHack Tournament]], has run in /dev/null/nethack's old timeslot in November.

==Results==
The official scoreboard was hosted [http://nethack.devnull.net/tournament/scoreboard.shtml on the tournament site]. The archives are incomplete, not covering any tournaments past 2008.

To address this and other problems with the official website, unofficial scoreboards have been created:
* [https://nethackscoreboard.org/devnull/ The NetHack Scoreboard] (does not consider clans or trophies)
* [http://gunyoki.net/ Clan EIT's scoreboard] (does not consider clans, currently defunct)

These evaluate the tournament [[xlogfile]].

==Challenges==
Starting in 2005, the tournament added optional challenges to the game. Each year has added a new challenge, designated the Unknown Challenge until the completion of that year's tournament, and preserved the prior challenges. Some challenges are entirely internal to NetHack, and others require players to achieve a goal in another game.

Challenges are triggered by some action within NetHack. Upon the trigger, you may either accept the challenge, decline it for the current game, or ignore it permanently. If you accept, you are bound by the rules of the challenge until you complete it or choose to permanently ignore it via the tournament website. Challenges make NetHack harder in some way associated with the trigger until they are completed.

The tournament web site distributes a [[patch]] that adds the challenges to the game so that you may practice at home (or [[spoiler|spoil]] the challenges). The current tournament patch as well as the server kit that they use are available for download at http://nethack.devnull.net/software/index.shtml#patch.

=== Kingdom of Loathing challenge ===
This challenge was triggered by trying to engrave "[[Elbereth]]" and prevented players from engraving "Elbereth" while it was not completed.

Players had to play a different game, [[Kingdom of Loathing]], and succeed in beating an alternate-universe Wizard of Yendor (a bot set up by the tournament administrator for this purpose) there.

As the challenge tested for engraving Elbereth using the <tt>strcmp</tt> function, this only affected the exact string "Elbereth"; variations such as "elbereth" or "ElberethE" were not affected.

This challenge is "not operational" as of 2012 because of changes in the Kingdom of Loathing infrastructure being not compatible with the code the tournament used for the challenge.

=== Grue challenge ===
{{wikipedia|Grue (monster)}}
{{tool
 |name=Frobozz Company Inter-Dimensional Portal Generator TM
 |appearance=sinister device
 |weight=20
 |cost=1
}}
The [[Grue]] challenge was triggered by entering an unlit room. Before it was completed, players could not safely enter unlit areas as after 3 input actions, a Grue will "eat" them. This is an [[instant death]] that cannot be resisted; however, using a [[light source]] will prevent this.

This challenge suffered from a bug similar to the lava time bug as it considers ''input actions'', not turns; that is, checking your inventory three times will kill you.

A "sinister device" can be found in the challenge level, which is a large empty unlit room. The device has to be formally [[identification|identified]] and then applied to complete the challenge.

The portal to the challenge level was randomly placed in [[Mines' End]]; as large parts of the mines are usually unlit, clearly the tricky part is not the challenge level per se, but reaching it. It is also advisable to have a [[scroll of identify]] ready before embarking on the trip to the challenge level, as it can otherwise be hard to formally identify the device.

=== PacMan challenge ===
{{wikipedia|Pac-Man}}
{{tool
 |name=energizer pellet
 |appearance=shiny pellet
 |weight=20
 |cost=1
}}
{{tool
 |name=lifegiving bonus fruit
 |appearance=fruit token
 |weight=20
 |cost=1
}}
The PacMan challenge was triggered by trying to eat "fruit". Before it is completed, players could not eat any "fruit". Those items are considered "fruit" for this purpose:
* [[apple]]s
* [[orange]]s
* [[pear]]s
* [[melon]]s
* [[banana]]s
* [[carrot]]s
* [[slime mold]]s (or any other user-named fruit)

In the challenge level, players had three "lives"; being attacked by any of Blinky, Inky, Pinky or Clyde (roughly equivalent to the ghosts in the original PacMan) would remove one of these lives. Once all of these lives were removed, the player was forced to leave the challenge level and unable to reenter in the same game. Applying an identified life giving bonus fruit outside the challenge level would restore three lives and allow re-entry and completion of the challenge.

The portal to the challenge level generated on the [[Oracle]]'s level.

To complete the challenge, all squares of the level had to be walked on; they would seem to turn from lit to unlit. When the challenge was completed, the level had to be left using the portal also used to enter.

Monsters on the challenge level could always be seen, even when walls would normally obstruct the view. The level was automatically mapped when the player arrived. Phasing and digging were not possible.

If the player were invisible, the ghosts would not pursue the player as aggressively.

The level started fully lit, but because walking on a square unlighted it to indicate the player's progress, the PacMan level was ''not'' safe if the [[#Grue challenge|Grue challenge]] was currently in progress.

There were two lifegiving bonus fruits near the center of the maze; when formally identified and applied, each of them would add three additional lives.

There were also four energizer pellets; when formally identified and applied, the "ghosts" would flee from you. While they were fleeing, hitting any of them would instantly kill them, giving the message "Energized!".

The "ghosts" all respected [[Elbereth]]; in fact, as it made them flee, attacking them while standing on Elbereth would instantly kill them.  Note that for the 2017 tribute tournament, the 3.6.0 Elbereth mechanics applied.

As the portal was randomly placed on the challenge level, it was possible to start next to the ghosts.  

On the below map, {{red|(}} marks the lifegiving bonus fruits; these were normally displayed as {{cyan|(}}. {{cyan|(}} marks the energizer pellets. The ghosts are {{red|&}} Binky, {{purple|&}} Pinky, {{cyan|&}} Inky, and {{orange|&}} Clyde.

=== ZAPM challenge ===
The ZAPM challenge was triggered by attempting to make a wish, and until it is completed, wishing was not possible.

The game of ZAPM, supplied by the /dev/null public servers (or the [[hardfought]] servers for the tribute challenge in 2017), became available and a player would have to win once to complete the challenge. See the [[ZAPM]] page for more information.

=== DigDug challenge ===
{{wikipedia|Dig Dug}}
This task was triggered by attempting to dig, and, once accepted, digging was not possible until the challenge was completed.

A portal somewhere in [[Minetown]] lead the player to the hiding place of {{green|D}} Fygar and his {{orange|p}} Pookas. Each of them had to be zapped four times with a {{brown|/}} wand of dangerously inflate monster. The first wand, with 4-8 charges, was lying in the main corridor; each of the challenge monsters started on (and picked up) another one of them. To access them, digging was allowed while within this level. A {{cyan|(}} [[pick-axe]] was provided in the main room.

[[Phasing]] through the walls was impossible on the challenge level. All monsters on the challenge level were always visible (even through walls) and the level was pre-mapped. The entire level was lit. It was possible for the portal to spawn inside of one of the areas containing Fygar or a Pooka; if this happened, the best strategy was to make judicious use of Elbereth and try to pick up the wand before the enemy does. In preparation for this eventuality, bringing your own source of digging was recommended.

Fygar and the Pookas did respect [[Elbereth]] and could be killed in a number of ways, but that didn't count in respect to the challenge. They had to be hit with the wands four times; if they died earlier the challenge would become unwinnable for the current game. Often the wands would miss, and the first one often ran out before another one could be harvested; it was advisable to bring a [[scroll of charging]] or two. Fygar breathed fire, so [[reflection]] wasn't a bad idea either.

=== Waldo challenge ===
This challenge was triggered by attempting to tame a monster; before it was completed, taming monsters was impossible. 

Any monster represented by a {{white|@}} had a chance of being generated as "Waldo," which could be seen through [[farlook]]. To complete the challenge, a player had to first identify Waldo through [[farlook]], and then [[chat]] to him. Waldo was only generated once in each game, so if he was killed before this was done, the challenge would be unwinnable for the current game.

In addition to Waldo himself, some Waldo lookalikes with similar names would also appear, although these did not help in completing the challenge. They each had a striped shirt and bobble hat in their inventory, which were items intended to be entirely cosmetic.

Earlier versions of this challenge were famously buggy, often becoming complete spontaneously with no apparent action by the player. Additionally, the bobble hat used to give an [[AC]] improvement of 10 points (and could be further enchanted), making it the best [[helm]] in the game by a very large margin. The bobble hat became something of a meme in some NetHack communities; an unqualified reference to "bobble hat" is typically taken to refer to the pre-bugfix version.

=== Pool challenge ===
This challenge was triggered by trying to push a [[boulder]]. Before it is completed, pushing boulders was impossible; manipulating boulders in other ways was still allowed.

On dungeon level 4, a second upstairs would generate, leading to the challenge level. This level was accessible even when the challenge has not been accepted; this was a bug. (Because a level cannot have more than three stairs, the existence of this challenge presumably also limited the [[Mines]] entrance to generate on level 2 or 3.)

The objective of the challenge was to fill all the pits on the challenge level with boulders. To do so, the boulders had to be hit with a cue boulder ({{purple|0}}) that could only be moved by applying a cue stick (found next to the stairs) to it. Boulders would bounce from walls and could set each other in motion.

There might have been more specific conditions on how the pits must be filled to successfully complete the challenge; currently they are not fully known, however.

=== Joust challenge ===
{{wikipedia|Joust_(video_game)}}
This challenge was triggered by trying to #[[ride]] a saddled monster. Riding steeds was not allowed until the challenge is successfully completed.

The challenge was accessed via a [[magic portal]] in the [[zoo]] at the top of [[Sokoban]].

The movement mechanics were modified to account for the alien gravitational conditions that prevail in the jousting arena.

The objective was to saddle and mount the ostrich(o), and defeat the Bounder(B), Hunter(H), and Shadow Lord(S), according to the rules of the original video game, which means hitting them from above (either directly or diagonally).  If the player was hit from above or while dismounted, it would cost them one of their three lives.  If the nemeses of this challenge (or the ostrich) died by any other means, the challenge would be unwinnable.

The ostrich started peaceful, but became tame when saddled (this conveniently bypasses the [[#Waldo challenge|Waldo challenge]]).

'''Players needed to bring their own [[saddle]]s''' to complete this challenge.  A [[lance]] was not required.

The ostrich was considered domestic, so could also be tamed by feeding (subject to Waldo restrictions); it had a similar diet to other 'o' class monsters, so the [[tripe ration]] was a good choice.

Exiting the challenge level via the portal while riding the ostrich would result in a forced dismount, leaving the ostrich behind, and '''the [[saddle]] would be lost'''.  However, leaving while not mounted, with the ostrich adjacent to the portal, would cause it to follow you out according to the usual pet following rules.

==Trophies==
The tournament also awarded trophies for all kinds of achievements within the game, ranging from the coveted Best of 13 to the Plastic Star.

There are six categories of trophies: Grand, Major, Challenge, Minor, Recognition, and Miscellaneous.

===Grand===
The Grand trophy used to be Highest Score until 2004, when it was changed to Best of 13. It was the sole trophy in its category and one of the most coveted.

* '''Best of 13''': Awarded to the player with most [[Ascension|ascensions]] in 13 consecutive games with no multiple ascension of the same [[race]]/[[role]]/[[alignment]]/[[gender]] combination.

===Major===
The Major trophies recognised a wide variety of NetHack skills:
* '''Most Ascensions''': Awarded to the player with most ascensions during the tournament, with no regard to character repetition.
* '''Fastest Ascension: Gametime''': Awarded to the player who ascends in the smallest number of game turns.
* '''Fastest Ascension: Realtime''': Awarded to the player who ascends in the shortest amount of real time.
* '''Lowest Scored Ascension''': Awarded to the player who ascends with the smallest [[score]].
* '''Best Behaved Ascension''': Awarded to the player who ascends with the largest amount of [[Conduct|conducts]] intact.
* '''First Ascension''': Awarded to the player who ascends first in the tournament.
* '''Most Unique Deaths''': Awarded to the player who attains the largest variety of deaths.
* '''Highest Scored Ascension''': Awarded to the player who ascends with the highest score (duh).

===Challenge===
The Challenge trophies were awarded to those who complete the various tournament challenges outlined above. Those who complete them first receive particular recognition.

===Minor===
Minor trophies included all trophies awarded for the highest score for a particular role.

===Recognition===
Recognition trophies were awarded for various milestones within the tournament, ranging from impressive ascension combos to reaching some fixed points within the game. All of the multi-ascension combos had an enhanced version, which can be obtained by completing all the games meeting the criteria for obtaining the trophy consecutively, with no games that are not eligible for the prize in between. (In 2017, with the tribute tournament, the requirement was to complete the trophy within a single streak of wins, rather than every game that ''contributed progress towards'' the trophy having to be consecutive.) Said version is called "foo with bells on".

* '''The Full Monty''': Awarded to all players who ascend at least one game with each gender, each role, each race, each alignment, and each conduct intact (of course, not within one single game). At least five players achieved this trophy: Marvin (with bells on) in 2007, maud and nuslayer (without bells) in 2009, qp (without bells) in 2012, and Tariru (without bells) in 2017.
* '''The Grand Slam''': Awarded to all players who ascend at least one game with each gender, each role, each race, and each alignment (not considering conducts).
* '''The Hat Trick''': Awarded to all players who ascend at least one game with each gender, each alignment, and each race (not considering conducts nor roles).
* '''The Double Top''': Awarded to all players who ascend at least one game with each gender, and each alignment (not considering conducts, roles, nor races).
* '''The Birdie''': Awarded to all players who ascend at least one game with each gender.
* '''The Dilithium Star''': Awarded to those who ascend at least one game.
* '''The Platinum Star''': Awarded to those who enter the [[Astral Plane]] in at least one game. Getting this award makes it known to everyone that you [[Splat|splatted]] on Astral.
* '''The Gold Star''': Awarded to those who enter the [[Elemental Planes]] in at least one game.
* '''The Silver Star''': Awarded to those who defeat the [[High priest|High Priest of Moloch]] or otherwise acquire the [[Amulet of Yendor]] from him in at least one game.
* '''The Bronze Star''': Awarded to those who perform the [[Invocation Ritual]] in at least one game.
* '''The Steel Star''': Awarded to those who defeat the [[Wizard of Yendor]] in at least one game.
* '''The Brass Star''': Awarded to those who defeat [[Vlad the Impaler]] in at least one game.
* '''The Copper Star''': Awarded to those who enter [[Gehennom]] in at least one game.
* '''The Zinc Star''': Awarded to those who defeat [[Medusa]] in at least one game.
* '''The Iron Star''': Awarded to those who defeat their [[Quest_nemesis#Quest_leaders_and_nemeses|Quest Nemesis]] in at least one game.
* '''The Lead Star''': Awarded to those who reach the [[Mines' End]] level in at least one game.
* '''The Plastic Star''': Awarded to those who complete [[Sokoban]] in at least one game.

===Clan===
* '''Best In Show''': Awarded to the Clan with the highest score, calculated by summing the values of the various individual trophies gained by the players.

===Miscellaneous===
* '''Killed By A [[Trickery]]''': Not a trophy in itself, but rather a recognition of administrative error or server malfunction that killed off one's character.

* [[Junethack]], another annual tournament which also includes [[variant]]s of NetHack.

There are many uses for the operating system '''FreeBSD''', but [[we]] know FreeBSD especially for its reputation as a stable server operating system. Some of the servers in the [[2006 /dev/null/nethack tournament]] used FreeBSD, as do the [[public server#ascension.run|ascension.run]] and [[public server#em.slashem.me|em.slashem.me]] public servers. (Compare FreeBSD with [[Debian]], the OS behind [[nethack.alt.org]].)

The [http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html FreeBSD Ports Collection] is the easy way to install software onto FreeBSD, turning your machine into a nice web server or KDE box, for example. The other [[BSD]] operating systems forked their ports collections from FreeBSD. Two packages interesting to NetHack players are [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/games/freebsd-games/ freebsd-games] (for [[Hack]], Larn, and [[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]) and [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/games/nethack36/ nethack36].

A unique feature of FreeBSD is the [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail&sektion=8 jail]. A jail has its own IP address and cannot see any files outside of the jail. Perhaps this convinced some tournament admins to use FreeBSD as a NetHack server, not another [[BSD]] or [[Unix]]. By locking the [[ssh]] or [[telnet]] server-daemon and [[NetHack]] in a jail, should there be a problem in security, the intruder is unable to attack anything outside of the jail.

FreeBSD supports fewer hardware platforms than [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]].

'''NetBSD''' is an operating system that runs on many platforms. [[NetHack]] is a computer game that runs on many platforms. (You can install NetHack above NetBSD by use of [[pkgsrc]].) There are other similarities too.

* ''"Our contributors communicate primarily via email and Internet-based chat systems; many of us have never met each other in person. ... We believe that the Internet was an enabling technology that made NetBSD possible. The 'Net' in our name was thus chosen as a tribute to the Internet."''
** [http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/about.html About the NetBSD Project]
* ''"Why is it called NetHack if it's a single player game that doesn't use the net? The 'Net' in NetHack refers to the way the developers, many of whom have never met in person, organize the work on the program."''
** [http://www.nethack.org/common/info.html NetHack 3.4.3: Information]

So the "Net" of both NetBSD and NetHack refers to that network, the Internet. This tribute may seem strange today, but that NetBSD and NetHack predate nearly all of today's projects. NetBSD 0.8 appeared at 20 April 1993, while [[NetHack 1.3d]] appeared on Usenet back in July 1987. The prefix "Net" also distinguishes these projects from the original [[BSD]] and [[Hack]]. The most important difference in organisation is that NetBSD has many developers and contributors, but NetHack has only its secretive [[DevTeam]].

== Hardware ports ==
'''NetBSD''' comprises binaries for 53 "machine architectures" spanning 17 different types of processors. It might be interesting to see if NetHack, built through [[pkgsrc]], can run on all of them. (You should instead be working toward [[ascension]] of all of the race-role-gender-alignment combinations.) If you lack hardware, you might try [http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/emulators.html running NetBSD on emulated hardware]. Note that the hardware list includes ancient hardware like the [http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/sun2/ sun2] and embedded devices with limitted processing power like [http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/evbarm/ ARM evaluation boards]. These are still powerful enough to run [http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/call-it-a-duck.html Unix-like] systems, though.

NetHack has been on hardware that NetBSD could never support. An Intel 286, for example, is too weak for a Unix-like operating system, but can run old versions of [[NetHack]] with [[MS-DOS]]. NetBSD may be a very portable OS, but NetHack is a very portable game; NetHack is more portable than NetBSD.

{{man|mg}}
'''Emacs''' is a [[Unix]]-based popular text-editor. Because of the [[Wikipedia:editor war|editor war]], a mention of Emacs typically reminds one of [[vi]], et vice versa. The two editors dominate Unix, and both have use when editing NetHack [[source code]] or [[nethackrc]] files.

* The mg editor ''"is compatible with emacs because there shouldn't be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or vi(1)."''
** [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mg OpenBSD mg(1) manual page]

In the Battle for NetHack, most signs suggest that [[vi]] is winning and Emacs is losing. Many players credit the [[yuhjklbn]] cursor system of ''[[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]'' and ''[[NetHack]]'' to the 'hjkl' cursor system in vi. Contrast the '^[BNPF]' system of Emacs, weak in scattering the relevant keys across the typical qwerty keyboard. This has vi given to NetHack, so what did Emacs give?

Emacs gave us '''[[nethack-el]]''', a [[user interface]] that consists of an Emacs [[EmacsWiki:MajorMode|major mode]], and a [[patch]] adding another [[window port]] to NetHack. How is this better than running Emacs and an editor separately, as vi users would do? One should instead ask what game should an Emacs user choose over NetHack. The nethack-el interface is as extensible as and uses buffers like everything else in Emacs. It is not suprising that some Emacs addicts are also NetHack addicts.

This page is about how '''pkgsrc''', the [[NetBSD]] Packages Collection, compiles and installs [[NetHack]] onto several [[Unix]]-like operating systems, by patching NetHack to be more Unix-portable. {{clear}}

: ''Important: The information on this wiki page so far is the result of a study of the pkgsrc documentation and CVS repository, with no actual experience using pkgsrc. Thus this page more probably contains errors.''

== Introduction ==
pkgsrc has its origins as a fork of the [[FreeBSD]] Ports Collection. It consists of [[Makefile]]s interpreted by the NetBSD "[[make]]" command. These Makefiles use dependencies so that packages build in the correct order. Thus when you do this:

 # cd /usr/pkgsrc/games/nethack
 # make install

First, this installs any dependent packages, such as [[X11]] or [[Qt]], if they are missing. Then it runs [http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/build.html several phases] to download, patch, build and install the package. The pkgsrc Makefiles call the package's Makefiles to do the actual build and install.

An interesting study is to examine the patches that pkgsrc provides, to check if [[Unix]] software required portability fixes.

== NetHack ==
Currently pkgsrc can install [[NetHack 3.4.3]] above [[Unix]]. This uses five packages, because pkgsrc does not support something like [[OpenBSD]]'s flavors or [[Gentoo]]'s USE flags.

The [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack/ nethack] package simply depends on the [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-qt/ nethack-qt], [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-tty/ nethack-tty], [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-x11/ nethack-x11] packages, so installing "nethack" gives you all three user interfaces. All three packages depend on [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/ nethack-lib] package which installs the [[playground]].

The nethack-{qt,tty,x11,lib} packages all interact with the NetHack sources, but by invoking different targets in NetHack's top Makefile. Thus it is well possible for a user with nethack-qt to install nethack-tty without uninstalling anything or rebuilding everything; this is an advantage over flavors or USE flags.

The result is up to three executables sharing one playground; this differs from the typical setup of having one executable and setting the [[win]] option in NETHACKOPTIONS or a [[nethackrc]].

=== Patches ===
The patches live in /usr/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches, and there are eight patches. These patches are small portability fixes or tweaks to interface with pkgsrc. These patches are not like those from the [[NetHack Patch Database]] that add new features to the game.

There are eight patches, one per file, because pkgsrc does not here use "diff -r". (The following list is from HEAD on 2 December 2006, what will become pkgsrc 2006Q4. Compared to 2006Q3, it contains a build fix for [[Linux]].)

* [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches/patch-aa?rev=1.9&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup patch-aa] to [[config.h]]; makes the common configuration changes of enabling vision tables and using gzip.
* [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches/patch-ab?rev=1.11&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup patch-ab] to Makefile.top; mostly tweaks to permissions and the installed file hierarchy, and new targets 'binfiles' and 'datastuff' to separate nethack-lib from interface packages.
* [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches/patch-ac?rev=1.9&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup patch-ac] to [[system.h]]; several portability fixes discussed below.
* [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches/patch-ad?rev=1.5&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup patch-ad] to nethack.sh; changes to support the five-package system.
* [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches/patch-ae?rev=1.4&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup patch-ae] to Makefile.doc; a simple change to install the nethack(6) manual page in the same prefix as everything else.
* [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches/patch-af?rev=1.6&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup patch-af] to [[unixconf.h]]; define SYSV or BSD, disable TERMINFO, change a default mail setting above NetBSD.
* [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/patches/patch-ag?rev=1.2&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup patch-ag] to [[mail.c]]; change default mail settings above NetBSD.

Some of the patches add seemingly-useless words like <tt>XXXPREFIXXXX</tt> or <tt>__NETHACK_OS__</tt> or <tt>@GZIP_PROGRAM@</tt>. In a post-patch phase, pkgsrc uses "sed" to replace these with the correct values. (The code is in [http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/games/nethack-lib/Makefile.common?rev=1.22 Makefile.common].) Currently, <tt>__NETHACK_OS__</tt> becomes <tt>SYSV</tt> if the system is [[Linux]], and <tt>BSD</tt> above all other systems; <tt>LINUX</tt> is never set.

=== patch-ac (system.h) ===
The purpose of NetHack 3.4.3's system.h file is to implement the various settings from config.h and (above Unix) also unixconf.h. Generally, one edits or patches config.h and unixconf.h, not system.h.

What motivates pkgsrc to patch system.h is that system.h really does a poor job on Unix. It makes many outdated assumptions and fails to handle the existence of the newer Unix clones. One change demonstrates a problem in NetHack, for pkgsrc changes [[system.h#line82]] from

 if (!defined(SUNOS4) && !defined(bsdi) && !defined(__FreeBSD__)) || defined(RANDOM)

to

 if (!defined(SUNOS4) && !defined(bsdi) && !defined(__NetBSD__) && !defined(__FreeBSD__) && !defined(__DragonFly__) && !defined(__APPLE__)) || defined(RANDOM)

Notice how __NetBSD__, __DragonFly__ and __APPLE__ have joined bsdi and __FreeBSD__ here.

{{man|srandom}}
The problem is the "srandom" declaration at [[system.h#line83]]. The declaration causes a compiler error above [[DragonFly]], [[NetBSD]] and Apple [[Mac OS X]]. ''Vanilla NetHack 3.4.3 does not build on DragonFly, NetBSD nor Mac OS X.'' The error is that <tt>/usr/include/stdlib.h</tt> declares "srandom" to take an unsigned long, but NetHack declares it to take an unsigned int; the two prototypes come to conflict.

pkgsrc does the minimum to port NetHack to DragonFly, NetBSD and Mac OS X. (It would be more correct if Unix NetHack never declared system functions, but relied all upon header files.)

&&%s&& %s Murder {148663 2022-10-06T13:10:35Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} there's an article for that In NetHack, '''murder''' is the act of killing a formerly [[peaceful]] [[human (monster attribute)|human]] such as a [[watchman]], [[shopkeeper]], or [[aligned priest]].{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2463|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Specifically, killing humans of types that are [[peaceful#List of monsters that may be generated peaceful|not always generated hostile]], are not [[player monster]]s, and that, when killed, [[alignment record#Alignment gains from killing monsters|adjust your alignment record]] by a non-positive number, will subject you to a murder penalty if you are not chaotic.}}  This only applies to humans who were generated as peaceful, not to those who were generated as hostile then pacified through magic. In particular, [[Keystone Kop]]s do not count because they are generated hostile. If you anger the [[high priest]] of [[Moloch]] by entering their [[temple]], you may kill without being considered a murderer.{{refsrc|src/priest.c|429|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=The [[alignment record]] gain you get from killing the high priest is set to a positive value when angered by you entering their temple.}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|2076|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} If you are called an infidel, it's fair game. Killing the high priest from outside the temple, without first entering it, still counts as murder.  Killing a [[guard]] is murder, even if the guard attacks first.

Unless you are [[chaotic]], murder will cause you to lose intrinsic [[telepathy]] and two points of [[Luck]].  The message when this happens is "You murderer!"

Note that whatever your race, only the killing of a peaceful ''human'' will ever be classed as murder.

Everyone including chaotics still gets a huge [[alignment record|alignment penalty]] for killing always-peaceful monsters (which mostly coincide with those that can be murdered): Minetown [[watch]], [[aligned priest|priests]], [[shopkeeper]]s etc.

== Strategy ==
One way to get rid of a peaceful human while avoiding the penalty for murder is to let your [[pet]] do the dirty work. Another option is a [[ring of conflict]]. You can also [[polymorph]] your victims before killing them.  Note that a human's death of [[system shock]] from your failed attempt to polymorph them ("<the human> shudders") also counts as murder.

It's a good idea to carry a [[tin]] or two of [[floating eye]] meat in case you lose your telepathy (whether through committing murder or a [[gremlin]] attack).

==Variants==
In [[EvilHack]], always-peaceful monsters are now [[racial monster]]s as well, meaning that murder is no longer limited to just killing humans of these monster types.

&&%s&& %s Zoo {143288 2021-10-20T21:12:32Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* History */ [[Image:Treasure zoo.jpg|thumb|right|The player encountering a treasure zoo.]]

A '''zoo''', short for a '''treasure zoo''', is a [[special room]] that occurs in ''[[NetHack]]''. It can be randomly generated in the Dungeons of Doom, and also appears in several [[special level]]s. Most of the squares in the zoo are occupied by a [[sleep]]ing random monster and a random amount of gold.

==Generation==
Zoos can be randomly generated on any level in the main branch beneath level 6.{{refsrc|src/mklev.c|774|nethack=3.6.6}} Each normal, non-maze level has a one in seven chance of containing a zoo ''unless'' the level already has a shop, a throne room, or a leprechaun hall.{{refsrc|src/mklev.c|764|nethack=3.6.6}} In practice, this means the player has about a 10% chance of finding one on eligible levels.

===Special levels with zoos===
The top floor of [[Sokoban]] always has a zoo at the end of the fourth floor, with the closets containing the Sokoban prize behind it. 

[[Fort Ludios]] has a zoo in the frontmost section of the level, which is the first room the player must pass through.

In the [[Tourist quest]], a zoo can be found on the eastern end of the locate level, the Thieves' Guild Hall.

The middle level of the [[Wizard's Tower]] has a large zoo that must be crossed to reach the upstair.

==Strategy==
The main risk of zoos is being overwhelmed by multiple attackers, or else having any escape routes potentially cut off.

A common strategy is to use [[stealth]], either via intrinsic or through an item such as [[elven boots]] or a [[ring of stealth]]. Stealthy characters can attack each sleeping monster one at a time without waking up the entire zoo, making combat much easier. Be careful to avoid [[kick]]ing anything or engaging exploding enemies such as [[yellow light]]s and [[gas spore]]s; blocking off pets that lack stealth may also be advisable. Stealth is not viable for the Fort Ludios zoo, as entering the level causes an alarm to sound and wakes all the monsters on the level.

It is often safer to displace several pets into a zoo - monsters will use their ranged attack only against you, and will only attack the pet when it attacks them. You may need to stay close to keep your pets healed, however.

For combat situations where most or all of the zoo's inhabitants have been awakened, you can opt to use a [[ring of conflict]] and turn them against each other. Keep in mind that you are still an eligible target and may still find yourself on the wrong end of some projectile attacks; conflict will also endanger your pet and/or cause them to attack you as well if they are in the area.

==History==
Treasure zoos first appear in ''Hack for PDP-11'' a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]] - [[Hack 1.0]] is the first to use the name '''David's treasure zoo'''. In Hack 1.0 and [[Hack 1.0.1]], if a player's login name was "david", the treasure zoo would appear much more frequently for that character.<ref>[[Source:Hack_1.0/mklev.c#line147|Hack 1.0 mklev.c, line 147]]</ref>

==Origin==
The "David" that the zoos are named for refers to [[David S. H. Rosenthal]], who was a co-worker of [[Andries Brouwer]] in 1982.

==Messages==
{{message|You hear a sound reminiscent of a seal barking.<br>You hear a sound reminiscent of an elephant stepping on a peanut.|There is a zoo on the level.}}

&&%s&& %s Conflict {142465 2021-09-07T06:19:44Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Effects */ '''Conflict''' is a useful but dangerous [[property]] that causes monsters to attack indiscriminately.

== Effects ==
Conflict has several effects. [[Peaceful]] or [[tame]] monsters will start attacking you or other monsters near them, though for all other purposes they are still considered peaceful or tame; i.e., attacking them still carries consequences. This makes conflict dangerous near strong [[pet]]s, [[shopkeeper]]s, or other peaceful monsters. However, it will also make nearby monsters attack each other instead of you, which can be incredibly helpful, particularly in high-density areas like the [[Astral Plane]] and [[Moloch's Sanctum]].

Monsters are affected if they are in your line of sight and at most 8 squares away. Blinded monsters and the [[Wizard of Yendor]] are impervious to conflict.{{refsrc|mon.c|609}} Monsters with a sufficiently high combined [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] and [[level]] can resist this.{{refsrc|mhitm.c|115}}{{reffunc|zap.c|resist}}{{refsrc|monmove.c|502|comment=All these extra checks do not apply to spellcasters casting spells at range}}

Monsters may resist conflict; this happens if <code>rn2(100 + alev &minus; dlev) < mtmp->data->mr</code>, where <code>alev</code> is 5 for a ring of conflict and 10 for a weapon (like [[the Sceptre of Might]]), <code>dlev</code> is the monster's level capped at 50, and <code>mtmp->data->mr</code> is the monster's magic resistance. For peaceful monsters, <code>alev</code> is always 5.{{refsrc|monmove.c|551}} For example, a level 28 [[master mind flayer]] pet will always resist conflict from the Sceptre of Might, as [[rn2]](77) will always be smaller than the flayer's MR of 90. 

If you are generating conflict when you arrive on the Astral Plane, instead of getting a guardian [[Angel]], you will be attacked by some hostile Angels. If you are not generating conflict when you arrive, but do so later in the presence of your guardian angel, it will also turn hostile.

Monsters affected by conflict move around randomly if they have [[engulfed]] you. If used properly, this can be very helpful to a [[pacifist]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Per [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/2f255560252b0c18ed468baf94b58654bd5413f7 this commit:]

The chance to resist conflict now depends on the player's charisma, the monster's level, and the player's level. Conflict is resisted if <code>rnd(20) > min(19, (ACURR(A_CHA) - mtmp->m_lev + u.ulevel))</code> - thus, there is always at least a 5% chance to resist it. Conflict also now requires that the monster see the player, not that the monster be in the player's line of sight. These changes are imported from [[SporkHack]].}}

==Sources==
The main source of conflict is the [[ring of conflict]]. Unfortunately, wearing a ring of conflict burns [[nutrition]] very quickly; every even-numbered turn your nutrition is decremented. A ring of conflict can often be [[eating jewelry|eaten]] for a chance of obtaining conflict as an [[intrinsic]]. Intrinsic conflict has the same [[nutrition]] cost as extrinsic conflict, minus the [[ring hunger]].

Conflict can also be toggled by invoking the Sceptre of Might. This does not cause increased nutrition drain.

==Strategy==
Generating conflict is a very effective way of clearing out dense groups of enemies, since monsters will fight each other in addition to you. A common strategy is to burn Elbereth on the ground, and sit back and watch as the monsters battle it out while you take minimal damage. All monsters are prone to conflict (some may resist as explained in the formula above), including normally peaceful monsters and your pet; however, you can still incur the penalty of [[murder]] on the peaceful humans that attack you! [[Elbereth]] will continue to work against those who respect it as long as the engraving remains intact. Popular places for conflict are crowded levels such as the [[Big Room]] and certain quest branches. The [[elemental planes]] are also a good candidate for conflict, though generating conflict on the Astral Plane causes hostile [[Angel]]s to replace the usual tame one.

You do not gain experience when monsters kill one another, but the monsters will gain experience for themselves. Use caution when generating conflict in the presence of monsters that tend to grow up into more powerful forms, since they can rack up experience from killing off the lesser monsters. If you are sufficiently high level, this is usually not much of a problem. Also take care when generating conflict with priests or shopkeepers present. As mentioned above, they can and will attack the player while under conflict and you will still get the usual murder penalties if you kill them.

Be careful when skipping through all of the battle messages while generating conflict, as it is easy to skip over important messages pertaining to, for example, a cockatrice hissing at you and beginning to stone you. Always pay attention to the monsters around you and any status effects that you might have gained during the flood of "The <monster> hits the <monster>!" messages.

The [[ring of conflict]] is the general item used for generating by wearing and removing the ring as necessary. The safest method of conflict, from a nutrition standpoint, is the Sceptre of Might - you won't get hungry, but you also only get to [[invoke|turn it on]] every once in a while. Thus, the Sceptre is best used for emergency crowd-clearing, such as when a spellcasters [[summon nasties|summons nasties]].

Eating a ring to get intrinsic conflict is usually a [[bad idea]] as it will burn through nutrition very quickly, and you will have no way of shutting it off.  Don't try to dance with [[gremlin]]s if you ate the ring by accident; neither they (nor anything else) can remove this particular intrinsic, so you'll just have to [[ascend]] with it somehow.

== Variants ==
=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]], conflict does not function within the [[Black market (UnNetHack)|black market]].

=== xNetHack ===
In [[xNetHack]], as the Sceptre of Might is now the [[Priest]] quest artifact, the ability to invoke conflict is given to the new Caveman quest artifact, the [[Big Stick]]. The game also tracks "conflictless" [[Unofficial conduct#Conducts in variants|conduct]], which is broken by generating conflict.

To ride a monster, you must use the '''#ride''' [[command]] in the direction of a tamed saddled monster, and use the command again while riding to dismount. You must be in a humanoid form that is not too big or small to fit on a saddle in order to ride.

Riding a monster will decrease its tameness with each mount, unless you are a Knight.

===Suitable steeds===
Eligible monsters for saddling and riding include:

* All {{mcsl|q}}
* All {{mcsl|u}}
* All {{mcsl|C}}
* All {{mcsl|D}} except {{monsymlink|Ixoth}} and the {{monsymlink|Chromatic Dragon}}
* All {{mcsl|J}}
* {{monsymlink|Ki-rin}} and {{monsymlink|couatl}}s

Monsters are saddled by standing next to them and [[apply]]ing a saddle in their direction—it is possible to saddle a non-tame monster, but this is more difficult than saddling a pet, and you will not be able to ride the monster until it is tamed.

===Conditions for riding===
The chance of your attempt to mount your steed succeeding is (5 &times; (your [[experience level]] + steed's [[tameness]])) percent; if your attempt fails, you will slip while trying to get on and lose 10&ndash;14 hit points.{{refsrc|steed.c|315}} You cannot attempt mount a steed if any of the following conditions apply:

* You are already riding
* You are [[hallucination|hallucinating]]
* Your [[wounded legs|legs are wounded]]
* Your [[encumbrance]] is stressed or worse
* You are [[blind]] and not [[telepathy|telepathic]]
* You are [[punishment|punished]]
* You or your steed are [[trap]]ped
* You are [[levitation|levitating]] and cannot come down at will
* You are wearing [[erosion|rusty or corroded]] body armor

You will always fail and slip if any of the following apply:{{refsrc|steed.c|327}}

* You are [[confused]]
* You are [[fumbling]]
* You have [[slippery fingers]]
* Your steed's saddle is [[cursed]]

Invoking [[the Heart of Ahriman]] while riding will levitate the steed along with you.

== Riding skill ==
{{Riding skill table}}
The '''riding skill''' is not required to ride a monster, but has an effect on your ability to fight and perform other actions while riding. The success of saddling, mounting, dismounting, and goading the steed to gallop are determined by your skill level in riding.

It takes 101 steps while riding to exercise the riding skill, and thus takes 2020 steps to train the skill enough that you can go from Unskilled to Basic<ref>{{function|steed.c|exercise_steed}}; increment is postfix rather than prefix so it takes 101 turns rather than 100</ref>—keep in mind that most ridable monsters are faster than the "default" speed of 12.

===Bonuses and penalties===
While riding, your carrying capacity will be set to maximum, and your movement [[speed]] is set to that of the steed (e.g., a [[horse]] is as fast as a character wearing [[speed boots]], and a warhorse is even faster). However, many of your other actions—fighting, quaffing, reading, zapping, and engraving while riding—still rely on your own movement speed.

Your steed will be more passive while riding—it will not pick up items, will not react if riding over cursed items, and will not spontaneously attack monsters. However, monsters have a chance of attacking your steed instead of you, causing your steed to counterattack. You can also use polearms effectively at close range while riding.

A character riding at Unskilled level has a &minus;2 [[to-hit]] penalty—Basic skill reduces the penalty to &minus;1, and [[twoweapon]]ing always adds an additional &minus;2 to-hit on top of any other penalties. Riding at Skilled level or higher gives a +1 damage bonus, and Skilled level also gives a +1 to-hit bonus to non-twoweapon combat.{{refsrc|weapon.c|1411|nethack=3.6.1}} Higher skill ranks also improve rates of success for saddling, mounting, dismounting, and goading the steed to gallop.

Basic skill is required in order to be able to pick objects up from the floor while riding, and you cannot eat food off the ground; strangely, [[tinning kit]]s can still be used on corpses without dismounting.

==Riding over traps==
Your steed will be subject to the traps that you ride through—however, tameness is not decreased by riding into traps (even known traps), unlike other methods of leading a pet into a trap. If you ride into a pit, your steed will be damaged by the fall. If you ride into a polymorph trap, your steed will polymorph (most likely into something that can't carry you); if this occurs and you hit the ground, you will polymorph as well. A source of [[magic resistance]] (e.g. a [[cloak of magic resistance]]) or an [[amulet of unchanging]] will protect both you and your steed from polymorph traps.

==Movement limitations and other properties==
You cannot dip objects in pools unless on a flying or [[swimming]] steed; dipping into [[fountain]]s will work as normal. Setting traps while riding has a chance of failure, but the chance can be greatly minimized with good [[Luck]], and you will be warned before applying the trap—[[fumbling]] or using a cursed trap will increase the chance of failure. Failing to set a [[beartrap]] causes it to drop harmlessly to the floor, but failure to set a [[land mine]] will detonate it instead.

If you ride a non-[[flying]] steed downstairs while burdened, you will fall off and injure both legs. Oddly, you cannot use stairs while your steed is eating, even though you can still move around within the level itself.

[[Shopkeepers]] will block the entrance to their [[shops]] while you are riding. If you get past them in some other way, however, they will be happy to do business with you without forcing you to dismount.

Invoking [[conflict]] while riding may cause your steed to throw you off, subject to your steed's [[magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance stat]].

==Strategy==
Most players who elect to ride often or in the long run should consider carrying a [[stethoscope]] to monitor the health of their mount by applying it to them using {{kbd|>}}. Be sure to run away or heal your steed if they are in trouble—if you [[teleport]] while riding, your steed will be teleported with you. You can also heal your steed with a spell of {{of|spellbook|healing|or=1|extra healing}} by specifying {{kbd|>}} as the direction of the spell; spellcasting steeds can heal themselves even while you are riding them.

In addition to food for your steed, other items are worth keeping on hand for the long-term rider—a [[wand of speed monster]] can increase their speed further, and a [[wand of undead turning]] may be ideal for worst-case scenarios if your fallen steed leaves behind a corpse.

If riding with the skill at Unskilled level or restricted, you can apply a [[bullwhip]] downward to snag items—there's a chance that the whip will instead slip loose or whip your steed into [[gallop]]ing (decreasing its tameness).{{refsrc|apply.c|2154}}{{refsrc|steed.c|397}} While Basic skill is sufficient for most use cases, Skilled is nice to have for better to-hit, and higher skill ranks improve rates of success for riding-related activities—though their success rates can also be bolstered via improving [[dexterity]] and [[charisma]].

===Choices of steed===
The notable choices of steed from those eligible are as follows:

* [[Horse]]: Ponies are 16-speed monsters that can grow up into a 20-speed horse and then a 24-speed warhorse, which can be further increased to 32 via wand of speed monster—Knights in particular always start with a saddled pony. While easy to tame or pacify, and capable of doing solid damage with their high speed and kicking, horses are herbivorous and thus somewhat difficult to keep fed once tamed.
* [[Unicorn]]: All unicorns have the same base speed as the warhorse and similarly solid damage, but taming one initially is somewhat more difficult. They have intrinsic [[poison resistance]] and the ability to cure many other status ailments using their [[unicorn horn|horn]].
* [[Dragon]]: All dragons are carnivorous and thus easy to keep fed, and can be acquired via [[egg]], including ones laid while polymorphed into a dragon. They are capable of flight and have good AC, but have low movement speed at 9 (12 after gaining intrinsic speed). Dragons also have valuable intrinsics based on their color—gray and silver dragons are notable for their immunity to death rays, and silver dragons can additionally reflect other rays aimed at you.
* [[Jabberwock]]: The jabberwock lacks the dragon's breath weapon, scales and intrinsics, but has stellar hit dice and damage with 4 2d10 attacks, as well as a better base speed of 12 (18 when fast).
* [[Ki-rin]]: Ki-rin are naturally fast at 18 base speed, capable of flight, and can cast healing spells on itself. However, they are very rare and difficult to tame—they are also inediate and thus cannot be fed, meaning that they will eventually untame. As such, they are primarily if not entirely sought out by Knights. Due to their high monster magic resistance, they will always resist conflict unless drained below level 15.
* [[Centaur]]: Mountain centaurs are the strongest type, but are still slower than warhorses and unicorns (20 base speed vs. their 24). However, they are omnivorous and thus much easier to keep fed, and can even equip a [[shield of reflection]] and a weapon. However, they are at serious risk if allowed to eat a shapeshifter's corpse.
* [[Leocrotta]], [[mumak]], and [[mastodon]]: While most quadrupeds are not particularly noteworthy as steeds, the leocrotta is quite fast with a natural speed of 18 (best among its monster class) and has solid hit die. The mumak and mastodon are much slower (9 and 12 base speed), but have incredibly powerful headbutt attacks.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Several changes made to the upcoming version of NetHack also affect the viability of certain steeds:

* Ki-rin now have [[poison resistance]], and are no longer considered [[animal]]s. They also now have the ability to cure themselves using their horns like unicorns, but their horns will not drop.
* Riding while wearing an [[amulet of flying]] will cause the steed to fly as well. Among other things, a mountain centaur with a source of reflection, a unicorn horn and an artifact weapon can be a somewhat viable competitor to the ki-rin.
* Per [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/8d2407f1f21cc60ac99e08f00233975b32321eef this commit], pets can now gain intrinsics from corpses, making riding potentially far more viable in the long term and bolstering the longevity of certain steeds.
* Pets will no longer eat corpses that make them polymorph, unless they are starving or on the verge of becoming untame.}}

===Intrinsics and your steed===
While player magic resistance also protects the steed as well, player reflection does not. In addition, jumping conveyed from [[jumping boots]] allows you to jump while riding, but speed and water walking conveyed via boots have no effect on the steed.

{{Todo|We need an exhaustive table clarifying which intrinsics and extrinsics transfer to your steed and under which circumstances. Is there a consistent, intuitive rule that can be applied?}}

==Messages==
{{message|You've been through the dungeon on a <steed> with no name.|You dismounted an unnamed steed.}}
{{message|It felt good to get out of the rain.|As above, while hallucinating. Both lines are a reference to the song "[[wikipedia:A Horse with No Name|A Horse with No Name]]".}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] allows the player to eat food off the ground while riding. It also introduces [[Pegasus]], a good steed candidate.

===Slash'EM Extended===
In [[Slash'EM Extended]], there are far fewer restrictions on suitable steeds. If the monster is tame, the player can apply a saddle and try to ride it; it doesn't matter if the monster is amorphous, whirly, unsolid, small, or a form that can't normally be ridden. While most such monsters don't make good steeds, high speed pets such as [[air elemental]]s may actually be worthwhile to ride, especially if it's moving faster than a player on foot.

Saddling a [[foocubus]] is possible, where in ''NetHack'' it does not work and results in [[YAFM]]—doing so in Slash'EM Extended still abuses the player's [[wisdom]].

&&%s&& %s Read {141682 2021-07-09T19:40:57Z {4001381 Qt} reading engravings in vanilla don't use "the read command" By pressing {{kbd|r}} you can '''read''' something.

[[NetHack]] allows [[you]] to read [[object]]s in your [[inventory]]:
* [[fortune cookie]]s, to read the fortune without eating the cookie.
* [[T-shirt]]s, and in [[3.6.0]], [[apron]]s, to examine the message on each item.
* [[scroll]]s, to activate them.
* [[spellbook]]s, to study them.<ref>[[read.c]]</ref>
* [[credit card]]s
* [[magic marker]]s
* [[gold piece]]s
* [[the Orb of Fate]]
* [[candy bar]]s

You can try unsuccessfully to read other classes of objects.

In vanilla NetHack, you automatically read any floor [[engraving]]s or [[headstone]]s that you encounter. This does not use the {{kbd|r}} command, nor does it break [[illiterate]] [[conduct]]. (Though ''reading'' an engraving does not break the conduct, ''[[engrave|writing]]'' one does.)

== NetHack brass ==
In [[NetHack brass]], you automatically read any floor engravings, but not headstones.<ref>NetHack brass 040923/engrave.c#line212</ref> To read headstones, press {{kbd|r}} and then answer {{kbd|y}} to the question, ''"Do you want to read an epitaph on the grave?"'' In brass 040923, reading the epitaph does not break illiterate conduct.

== SLASH'EM ==
[[SLASH'EM]] requires you to explicitly read floor engravings and headstones, by pressing {{kbd|r}}. Doing so breaks the illiterate conduct.{{refsrc|engrave.c|372|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

By pressing {{kbd|r}} then {{kbd|,}}, you can read objects that are on the floor. Thus, if you suddenly need to flee and you have no empty inventory slots, but luckily found a [[scroll of teleportation]] on the floor, SLASH'EM lets you activate it.

SLASH'EM lets you "read" [[ring]]s. This is a feature to check the color of rings that you are currently wearing, otherwise ''"You can't see it!"'' or ''"Perhaps you should put it on first."'' Currently, only a [[mood ring]] will glow with color; any other ring gives the message, ''"There seems to be nothing special about this ring."''{{refsrc|read.c|80|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

The effect will close and lock chests and doors. If the door or the lock is broken, it will be repaired. If the doorway has no door at all, a door will be created. (If there is something in the doorway, the spell will not work.) On [[rogue level|Rogue level]] where doors are non-existent, a primitive doorway changes to a non-found secret door.

== Strategy ==

=== Uses ===
You can use wizard lock to lock a door if you do not have a key or lock pick. However, given the frequency of keys and lock picks, this is not a common use, since it needs a charge or 10 Power (keys and lock picks are free) and is more effort to use than applying a key. The main advantages of wizard lock over a locking tool are that you need not be adjacent to the door to use it, and that it works on empty doorways and open doors in addition to closed doors. This makes it an action faster in the best case, and considerably faster in the worst case, because sometimes intelligent monsters will open doors before a locking tool can lock them. As such, wizard lock is particularly appropriate when you are being chased, most likely in the early game or on the [[Astral Plane]], as it is guaranteed to close and lock a door in one turn, whereas doing so manually requires at least two (and often more, as you may fail to close or lock the door in one turn). Monsters rarely carry keys, so an immediately locked door is usually safe; [[shopkeepers]], however, have keys, and [[riders]] and enemies with particularly high strength can bypass locked doors.

If you have a wand of locking and a [[wand of opening]], you could theoretically smash a number of monsters in a [[drawbridge]] by zapping them alternately. However, you could only do this a few times before the charges run out, and so this is not a common strategy. It would be slightly more doable if you had the spell versions, {{Spell of|knock}} and {{Spell of|wizard lock}}, but it would still cost 15 Power for each open and close, and [[Drawbridge#Strategy|clearing the castle this way]] can sometimes take nearly a hundred turns (that's 1500 power).

If you need to remove a trapdoor and don't have a boulder handy to fill it, you can use this spell to remove it, provided that you have [[Ring of levitation|levitation]], [[flying]], or a lot of patience to step on it repeatedly until you escape it. Note that this does not work for holes, so it cannot be used to close holes that monsters have created by zapping [[Wand of digging|wands of digging]] downwards.

Locking chests is useless in terms of protecting the items inside (monsters do not open boxes), but the ability to repair the lock could be useful in unusual situations. Prior to [[NetHack 3.6.0]], if a box contains an unidentified [[gray stone]], you might wish to destroy the box without taking out the stone, so that you can kick it to see if it is a [[loadstone]]. You can attempt to destroy the box by [[Force|#forcing]] it with a blunt weapon; if this fails to destroy the chest, you can use wizard lock to repair the lock and try again. (NetHack 3.6.0 introduces the [[tip]] command, which safely removes the stone and makes this strategy obsolete.) Additionally, a locked chest or box can be used to contain a [[troll]] corpse and prevent it from reviving; if the only box you have nearby has a broken lock, you can use wizard lock to lock it in.

If a monster has damaged the walls of your stash, you can use wizard lock to fill them in with doors and give yourself a bit more shelter.

=== Blocked doorways ===
Any single object can prevent a door from forming or closing. If you want to use wizard lock to create a door on a certain square, then you need to remove any objects from there. This is mostly an issue if you want to lock a door after slaying some monster there, and the monster dropped something. If the monster dropped a heavy [[corpse]] or a [[loadstone]], then you might not be capable of clearing the square manually, although a [[wand of teleportation]] or the [[teleport away]] spell can potentially vacate objects from the doorway.

=== Monsters that can pass locked doors ===
[[Phasing]] monsters can pass through doors. [[Blob]]s, [[pudding]]s, [[mimic]]s, and [[light (monster class)|lights]] can squeeze or flow themselves underneath doors. Also, [[giant]]s can crash open doors.

Other than [[xorn]]s, most of these monsters are slow, so you should still be able to flee them. You might consider fighting one, knowing that the other monsters remain stuck behind the door.

&&%s&& %s PuTTY {149532 2022-12-25T19:42:31Z {187 Darth l33t} /* Recommended settings */ linux ttype is bad, it breaks curses graphics and doesn't seem to make anything better '''PuTTY''' is a free implementation of [[telnet]], ssh and terminal emulation by Simon Tatham.  It is the preferred way to play NetHack on a [[public server]] on Windows, as it is much more versatile and standards-compliant than Microsoft's telnet.exe that comes with Windows.

PuTTY can be downloaded from [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ the PuTTY homepage].

==Recommended settings==

If at all possible, connect using the SSH protocol, as Telnet provides no encryption or authentication and leaves your credentials vulnerable to network snoopers.

To make [[IBMgraphics]] work with PuTTY, you need to set Remote Character Set (under Window/Translation) to <tt>CP437</tt>

To make PuTTY looks exactly like the Windows terminal window, set the Font (under Window/Appearance) to <tt>Terminal</tt>

Make sure auto-wrap mode (under Terminal) is switched off or you terminal might get spammed with text artifacts.

When using [[number_pad]], it may be necessary to disable application keypad mode (under Terminal/Features).

When connecting to a server using [[dgamelaunch]], you may become disconnected if you accidentally resize the window to have a different width or height in onscreen characters. To prevent this from happening, choose between ''Change the size of the font'' and ''Forbid resizing completely'' under Window. You can also set the starting window size here.

<!--By default, PuTTY sets its terminal-type string as <tt>xterm</tt>, which breaks a lot of things. It's best to change its advertised terminal-type to <tt>linux</tt> (under Connection/Data).
-->
By default, right-click pastes in PuTTY. This can easily lose your game if you accidentally right-click a window when you have a long piece of text on the clipboard. It's recommended that you change the mouse button actions from Compromise to Windows (under Window/Selection) to disable this. Remember that, unless you save your session settings, you have to set this option again every time you play.

On some public servers running dgamelaunch, you can [[Dgamelaunch#PuTTY|configure PuTTY to log in automatically]]. Servers running other software may have their own auto-login methods.

==Color themes==
Colors can be configured to your preference by going to Window/Color and editing the RGB codes of each color. To avoid the work, many color schemes can be found [https://github.com/AlexAkulov/putty-color-themes here]; just follow the instructions in the <tt>README</tt> file.

==NetHack mode==

PuTTY has a special mode for playing NetHack<ref>http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.76/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-nethack</ref>. You can enable it by selecting ‘NetHack’ in the ‘Initial state of numeric keypad’ control (under Terminal/Keyboard).

In this mode, the numeric keypad keys 1-9 generate the NetHack movement commands (<tt>hjklyubn</tt>). The 5 key generates the . command (do nothing).

In addition, pressing Shift or Ctrl with the keypad keys generate the Shift- or Ctrl-keys you would expect (e.g. keypad-7 generates ‘y’, so Shift-keypad-7 generates ‘Y’ and Ctrl-keypad-7 generates Ctrl-Y); these commands tell NetHack to keep moving you in the same direction until you encounter something interesting.

For some reason, this feature only works properly when Num Lock is on.

(Note that [[Options#number_pad|OPTIONS=number_pad:<1,2,3,4>]] is superior to this client-level setting, since it lets you use the letters for other commands rather than redundant movement commands, but the option could be useful if you're playing on a server that doesn't let you edit your config file.)
