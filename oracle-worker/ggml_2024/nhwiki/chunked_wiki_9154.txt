&&%s&& %s Drain for gain {109620 2018-05-11T03:33:11Z {4000681 Andrio Celos} That was worded poorly. '''Drain for gain''' was a [[bug]] (SC343-10) that increases your maximum [[hit points]] and [[power]] by losing [[experience level]] (through some method of [[level drain]]) while having lower [[stats]] (in particular [[constitution]] and [[wisdom]]), then leveling up while having higher stats. By manipulating your stats before and after level drain, the amount of maximum HP and Pw you lose when losing levels could be made much smaller than the amount you gain when leveling back up.

In [[NetHack 3.6.0]], this bug was fixed by recording the HP/Pw increase at each level, instead of reducing it randomly based on Constitution and Wisdom. If you didn't gain any HP/Pw from other sources, draining a level will restore HP/Pw to exactly what it was before on each previous level. This effectively nullifies this strategy for HP or Pw gain by using things that increases/lowers constitution or wisdom, though it could still be used to do things like buy [[protection]] cheaply, or to "re-roll" better HP/Pw increases after you've increased your Con/Wis since the beginning of the game.

== Benefits ==
At the beginning of the game, characters usually start with lower stats. Applying this strategy would allow your character to reach and exceed the maximum HP and Pw potential for average characters of the same level. It has effects comparable with or even surpassing those obtained through [[alchemy]], [[nurse dancing]] and [[foocubi]], without requiring the same resources.

This strategy also allows you to play the game as a relatively low level character (but with a lot of HP and Pw) for a long time. This has several advantages:
* You can buy a lot more [[Protection_racket#Safer_alternative:_Level_drain|protection]] more cheaply. Self draining to XL1 allows you a chance to buy protection for only 400 gold, this makes even naked AC -10 possible through donation if you have finished Ludios.
* If you don't want to buy any more protection, you can give half as much gold (while carrying no more than double the amount you give each time) to the priest for [[clairvoyance]]. An XL1 character spending only a few thousand gold on this may get enough clairvoyance to last through the entire game.
* You can reassign your [[Skill slot|skill slots]].
* You can explore deeper dungeons while avoiding tougher monsters. Monsters with difficulty higher than (your level + dungeon level) / 2 are considered too strong to be generated. So if you drain yourself to XL1 before descending down every staircase, while keeping pets around to kill some monsters for you, you may be able to descend really deep with a much smaller chance of seeing tough monsters such as [[mind flayer|mind flayers]].
* You may use the [[polyself bug]].

Basically, if for any reason you want to drain your own level, you might as well try reducing your constitution and wisdom before doing so.

== Risks ==
You will temporarily lower your maximum HP with each cycle; during the first cycle in the relatively early game your hp may become dangerously low. But after two or three cycles you will probably end up at XL1 with 40+HP, with at least 9 points of protection, making low HP a much lesser concern from then on.

When you have only limited method of reducing stats (e.g. cursed and non-cursed unicorn horn which is usually only good for 1-pt CON reduction), the effect of HP gain may not be very obvious (or sometimes even a slight HP reduction). But if you keep gaining several experience levels before draining, eventually you will find your maximum HP increasing. Switching to  methods of greater stat reduction later in the game (e.g. rings of gain constitution) will accelerate your gain by a lot. You can combine multiple methods of stat reduction to achieve a greater effect. e.g. Applying a cursed unicorn horn while wearing a -2 ring of gain constitution until you get an extra -1 CON.

If you choose to lose level through a level-draining monster, you need to take caution not to die by over-draining yourself below XL1. This risk can be reduced by luring the monster into a controlled area (see below), zapping it with [[wand of slow monster]], wearing an [[amulet of life saving]], and/or using [[MSGTYPE]] if your game is compiled with it and you are using the [[tty]] interface. Consider putting the following lines in your [[options|options file]]:
 MSGTYPE=stop "Goodbye level *"
 MSGTYPE=stop "Sayonara level *"
 MSGTYPE=stop "Fare thee well level *"
 MSGTYPE=stop "Aloha level *"
 MSGTYPE=stop "Farvel level *"
This will force a --MORE-- prompt every time you get drained a level. Then you could even hold down '.' next to a wraith without getting accidentally over-drained. Also always remember to replace MC-giving items immediately after you finish. You may need some pets around to protect you, or stop yourself to take care of other monsters that show up while you are draining levels. Gaining 1 or 2 experience levels when clearing distractions could be fine even without increasing your stats first, as you can drain them right back down afterwards, and having low stats means the fluctuation of maximum HP and power would also be relatively small.

If you choose to play as a low-level high-HP character for an extended period of time, there are also several disadvantages, but most of them can be mitigated:
* It might become more difficult to hit monsters. Having a blessed [[luckstone]] and maximizing your luck greatly improves your chance to hit.
* You may not have enough skill slots for spells. Simply drain level again to switch to a different spell class when you need it, gaining yourself a few extra points of maximum HP and power while doing so.
* You may die to monster's level drain attack more easily. Having MC3 makes this risk almost negligible, and having level drain resistance (e.g. by wielding [[Excalibur]]) removes this risk completely.

== Execution ==
To use this strategy, you first need to find some methods of reducing stats, and a method of level-draining yourself. Then you need to find a way to increase your stats and level back up. In most situations, the resources for doing those only need to be obtained once, and then the cycle can be repeated indefinitely (and in some cases rather quickly, too).

===Reducing stats===
The following methods can be used for reducing stats:
* Wearing a negatively enchanted [[ring of gain constitution]] to reduce constitution, or removing a positively enchanted one.
* Wearing a negatively enchanted [[helm of brilliance]] to reduce wisdom, or removing a positively enchanted one.
* Engraving on a co-aligned [[altar]] will reduce wisdom by 1 without any other penalty. You can easily reduce wisdom to the minimum of 3 this way. A cross-aligned altar will reduce your ''Luck'' instead.
* Quaffing a non-blessed [[potion of sickness]] as a non-healer will decrease one stat, even if the character has [[poison resistance]]. You can obtain potions of sickness from [[Alchemy#Random_alchemy_results|random alchemy]].
* Applying a cursed [[unicorn horn]]. Two of the possible effects of a cursed unicorn horn are reducing constitution ("You feel fragile!") and reducing wisdom ("You feel foolish!"). You will need a way to cure other bad effects including sickness. Using a non-cursed unicorn horn would likely cure stat-losses as well, and therefore you may only be able to reduce your CON or WIS by 1 point despite repeated tries. Alternatively, using a [[cure sickness]] spell or blessed [[potion of healing]] to cure sickness may allow you to reduce stats lower. You can lock yourself in a [[closet]] and wait out all the non-sickness effects, though it may take a long time.
* Being seduced by [[foocubus]] while having low intelligence and charisma.  Two of five possible negative effects reduce constitution and wisdom by one, respectively.
* [[Abuse|Abusing]] them.

When your constitution is high enough, every extra point of CON reduction may have a large accumulated effect after draining multiple levels. So it might be worth the effort to get an extra point lower when you can (possibly through combining multiple methods above). See the table below for details.

===Draining your level===
The following methods can be used to drain your level:
* Throwing [[Stormbringer]] or [[The Staff of Aesculapius]] up and hitting yourself. Make sure you have enough HP to survive the hit. (You can wear a metal helmet to reduce the damage and draining will still take effect.)
* Removing [[Magic cancellation|MC]]-giving items and dancing with a level-draining monster such as a [[wraith]], [[vampire]] or [[barrow wight]]. A relatively safe way to do this is to lure a wraith into a lockable room, engrave Elbereth in front of the door with an object on top, then stand diagonally next to the door outside so that when your level is low enough, you can just step away and the wraith won't ever come out.

''(Hover over symbols for tips and links).''
* Casting [[Spellbook_of_drain_life|drain life]] at yourself.
* Dancing with [[Foocubus|foocubi]] at low [[charisma]], which may either drain you or lower your stats further, both of which are actually desirable at this stage. However, even a negative result has the same chance of giving the foocubus a [[cancellation|severe headache]], rendering it useless.

===Increasing stats===
The following methods can be used for increasing (or restoring) stats:
* [[Exercise|Exercising]] them. [[Donating to priests]] for a lot of clairvoyance is a good way to exercise wisdom <!--to max NOPE, maxing stats takes ridiculous amounts of exercise--> in the early game, as you exercise wisdom every 5 turns you enjoy clairvoyance.
* Applying a non-cursed unicorn horn to restore lost stats.
* Drinking a [[potion of restore ability]], preferably blessed, to restore lost stats.
* Using the [[Spellbook of restore ability|spell of restore ability]] to restore lost stats.
* Wearing a positively enchanted [[helm of brilliance]], or removing a negatively enchanted one.
* Wearing a positively enchanted [[ring of gain constitution]], or removing a negatively enchanted one.

===Leveling back up===
After fixing your stats, just kill some monsters to level up and watch as you get more maximum HP and Pw than before.

== Stats and HP/power gain per experience level ==
The HP and Pw gain per experience level for different roles and races is covered in detail in <ref>[http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/hppw-343.html HP and power starting values, level increases, and regeneration in NetHack 3.4]</ref>. [[Constitution]] is the only character stat related to HP gain per level. The effect of maximum HP bonus per level due to constitution is summarized in the following table:
{|class="prettytable" align="center"
!CON
!Bonus
|-
| 3
| -2
|-
| 4-6
| -1
|-
| 7-14
| +0
|-
| 15-16
| +1
|-
| 17
| +2
|-
| 18
| +3
|-
| 19+
| +4
|}

[[Wisdom]] is the only stat related to power gain per level. Every 2 WIS points has the approximate effect of adding d1 to the amount of power gain per level, this effect could be further multiplied depending on roles. (e.g. Wizards get a x2 multiplier.

It is possible to wish for corpses of corpseless monsters in [[wizard mode]].  These act exactly like normal corpses, with the weight, nutrition and intrinsics all drawn from [[monst.c]].  This includes monsters such as [[mummy|mummies]] and [[zombie]]s, which would normally drop another type of corpse. You must wish for "<monstername> corpse"; the game will not recognize "<monstername>'s corpse." [[Mimics]] can also mimic corpses of corpseless monsters.

{{RogueBasin|Moria}}
'''''The Dungeons of Moria''''', often shortened to just '''''Moria''''', is one of the earliest [[roguelike]] computer games, created in 1983 by Robert Alan Koeneke.

''Moria'' and its [[variant]]s rival ''NetHack'' in popularity - many classifications divide roguelike games between "hacklikes" and "*bands", with the latter being named after ''[[Angband]]'', the most famous ''Moria'' variant. ''Moria'' was also the first open source roguelike and was ported to many different computer platforms, which was a major achievement for the era.

==History==
''[[Rogue]]'' started as a binary for [[BSD]], which was then a variant of [[Unix]] running on VAX hardware. Because Rogue did not include its source code and originally ran only on one platform, several Rogue clones came into existence. Moria was the first of these many ''Rogue'' clones, or ''roguelikes'', created for computers running [[VMS]]. Meanwhile, a free Rogue clone known as ''[[Hack]]'' was made for Unix, from which ''NetHack'' would come to be; Hack added features such as [[persistent level]]s, [[pet]]s, and [[shop]]s, while ''NetHack'' changed the game even more with additions like [[dungeon branch]]es.

A port from VMS and Pascal to Unix was eventually created, known as ''Umoria'' - ''Angband'' is one of several ''Umoria'' variants - while another variant, called [http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Imoria Imoria], was created based on the original Pascal version.

Development of the original ''Moria'' essentially ended in the late 1980s, while development of other non-''Angband'' variants of ''Moria'' would continue until 1993; there was brief attempt to revive ''Imoria'' after this year, and development of ''Umoria'' would end in 1995. On the other hand, development of ''Angband'' and its derivatives continue to this day. The ''Moria'' community considers Umoria, VMS Moria, and in later eras Angband, to be "[[vanilla]]" versions of the game in contrast to variants like ''[http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=ZAngband ZAngband]'', ''IMoria'', or ''[http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Pmoria Pmoria]'' - these would be analogous to ''[[NetHack Plus]]'' or ''[[SLASH]]''.

==Summary==
''Moria'' and most of its variants are set in [[lotr:Middle-earth|Middle-earth]], with the game taking its name from [[lotr:Moria|the underground city of Moria]].

Moria deviates from the structure of ''Rogue'' in many significant ways, with the most notable being the addition of a town above the [[dungeon]]. Unlike ''NetHack'', where the [[dungeon]] is a long trek away from civilization, ''Moria'' has a town set right near the dungeon entrance. Due to the non-persistent floors, ''Moria'' generates a new level with new monsters and items every time you leave a floor and return to it at a later point, making staircases one-way; Angband would change this during its own development so that staircases could be re-used. Therefore, ''Moria'' players seeking to make stashes generally leave them in the town, where they may still be disturbed by the town's other inhabitants.

Another significant change from the structure of ''Rogue'' was the shift of the main objective. Rather than retrieving the Amulet, the objective of the original ''Moria'' and variants that retain its name is to reach the bottom of the dungeon and defeat [[lotr:Balrog of Moria|the Balrog]], which completes the game.

Both these changes and others, combined with the vastness of the dungeon and the impermanence of its floors, genereally means that the average ''Moria'' playthrough is of a similar length to ''NetHack'' if not longer. It may take weeks and months to play a Moria character from the beginning to either triumph over the Balrog or an inglorious death.

===The Town===
In ''Moria'', the town contains the bulk of the game's services and shops; central to Moria is the Scroll of Word of Recall, an item that warps you between town and the deepest visited dungeon level, reducing the time and danger of making a trip back to your stash. Some ''Moria'' variants expand on this feature: ''Angband'' and other *bands let you leave town to find other dungeons and towns, while ''Moria'' variant ''BOSS'' instead has you defeating one of the Boss's lieutenants, after which it automatically transports you to another town with a more difficult dungeon.

Shopping in ''Moria'' mostly consists of interacting with a menu at each shop entrance, meaning that you cannot attack or rob shopkeepers, and other citizens cannot enter shops or take items. Items in shops are bought and sold fully identified, shopkeepers pay a base price for unidentified items, and their wares do not include cursed items; this is a useful way to ID the wider number of different potions, scrolls, and other items that ''Moria'' has compared to ''NetHack''.

The six shops are a general store, an armory, a weaponsmith, a temple, an alchemy shop, and a magic-users' store; while beginners can supply themselves well if they have money, the dungeon will often still be the more viable source of better and higher-enchanted items. Food supply is limitless and thus largely a non-factor, unless one is playing an "ironman game" that forgoes access to the town.

===The Dungeon===
In Moria, there are two ways to label dungeon levels: by number (1, 2, 3, 4) as in ''NetHack'', or by depth where the measure is fifty times the level number (50 feet, 100 feet, 150', 200').

''Moria'' dungeon levels are much larger than those found in ''NetHack'', which are designed to fit on 80x24 terminals, and thus are split into panels. The map jumps to another panel as you approach the edge, and offscreen monsters might surprise you with attacks as you approach the edge. There is an option to center the screen on your hero ({{white|@}}), as in ''[[Linley's Dungeon Crawl]]''; the game typically disables this by default, so you may want to enable it prior to your first forays in. Larger levels mean larger rooms and longer corridors that take longer to explore, and it is not uncommon for some Moria players to take the first [[staircase]] they find instead of fully exploring a level.

Dungeons are also drawn differently. For example, a [[NetHack]] [[room]] and [[corridor]] might appear like this:

 ----------         #
 |........|     ########+     +   [[door]]
 |..{.....|     #   #         -   [[door|open door]]
 |..@.....|   ###   #         @   [[hero]]
 |........-####     #         - | [[wall]]
 |......d.|         #         d   [[dog]]
 |.%......|         #         %   [[food ration]]
 ----------         #

Now here is how it might appear in the dungeon of Moria:

 ##########    #####+####
 #........#    #...'.'..+     + [[door]]
 #........#  ###.###'####     ' [[door|open door]]
 #..@.....####...# #.#        @ [[hero]]
 #........'....### #.#        # [[wall]]
 #......j.######   #.#        j [[dog|jackal]]
 #.,......#        #.#        , [[food ration]]
 ##########        #.#

===Monsters===
In ''Moria'', ranged attacks from monsters can target you on any a square within their range, compared to ''NetHack'' and its eight-directional combat; ''Umoria'' variant ''Morgul'' allows the player to do so as well, as does ''Angband'' and its variants. Monsters cannot target the player around corners or pillars, allowing characters with sufficiently high speed to attack monsters and quickly dash out of their sight before they retaliate; this is known as "pillardancing".

As you fight monsters in Moria, the game will gradually "memorize" their capabilities and store it in a ''"monster memory"''. This feature contains information such as how many times you killed each type of monster, how fast they move, what attacks it has, and what level it normally appears on depending on how many of that monster you've fought. This monster memory is the only thing besides options that persists even after character death.

The lookup feature in vanilla ''NetHack'' only returns a literary quote associated with the monster in question; players must remember those monsters themselves, or else consult a bestiary of spoilers like the one hosted on this wiki. Some variants, such as [[SlashTHEM]] and [[xNetHack]], add a monster lookup or a "[[wikipedia:Pokémon|Pokedex]]" that can be used to research the stats of a given monster.

===Objects===
''Moria'' objects and their generation have a few base similarities to ''NetHack'' items. ''NetHack'' and ''Moria'' players can [[wield]] [[weapon]]s, [[wear]] [[armor]], and [[put on]] [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s; both games also have an active and a spare weapon slot, with [[swap weapons|a command to quickly swap the two]]. Weapons and armor can have enchantments that increase their damage or defense.

In ''Moria'', however, there are only 22 item slots from ''a'' to ''v'', not counting currently worn equipment (as wearing something frees up that [[inventory]] slot). ''NetHack'' inventories have 52 slots - ''a'' to ''z'' and ''A'' to ''Z'' (not counting the ''#'' used when picking up a [[loadstone]] with a full inventory). NetHack additionally has a wide selection of gems and many miscellaneous tools, including [[container]]s such as [[bag]]s and [[chest]]s to hold many "screenfuls" of items.

Saving slots in ''Moria'' is done by eventually replacing carried items with better ones, such as finding spellbooks with multiple spells, and amassing enough gold that they no longer need to gather [[junk]] to sell. ''Moria'' has no gems and fewer miscellaneous tools to worry about, and of those tools light sources have a dedicated slot; digging implements, which are second only in importance to lighting, can be put in the "spare weapon" slot.

''NetHack'' items can be [[Beatitude|blessed, uncursed or cursed]], with beatitude having an effect on item usage (i.e., blessed items often have much more beneficial or less harmful effects, while cursed ones tend to have weakened useful effects or much worse detrimental ones). ''NetHack'' items can also have additional properties applied, such as [[erosion]]-proofing, [[greasing]], and [[Charging|a set number of uses]]. While ''Moria'' items function similarly in that items can be cursed or noncursed, armor and weapons that are generated cursed have negative enchantments, and cursed weapons and armor cannot be removed, the curse itself does not actively degrade the item as in ''NetHack''. 

In lieu of [[artifact]]s, Moria has "Ego" items; unlike artifacts, more than one of a given type of ego item can appear in a given game, and can have any number of extra properties; a [[scimitar]] might have a "Frost" brand, making it a Scimitar of Frost that does extra [[cold]] damage and provides cold resistance. A [[scroll of identify]] will not reveal all these advanced properties, and only gives the two-letter code for the ego-type; the manual contains the key that details what each of the ego-types do.

Item generation probabilities remain uniform in ''NetHack'' across dungeon levels, though they differ between branches (e.g., item generation in the [[Gnomish Mines]] is slanted towards [[tool]]s). In ''Moria'', each item has an associated dungeon depth, and progressively more powerful items - higher-quality Ego items, weapons and armor with high enchantments, etc. - become more common as the hero descends deeper.

==Moria and NetHack==
''NetHack'' draws from J. R. R. Tolkien's setting and works, among many others, and naturally shares some other traits with ''Moria'' (e.g. the inclusion of [[lembas]], [[mithril]], etc.). For instance, the [[balrog]] of ''NetHack'' is a powerful regular enemy that generates in [[Gehennom]] and can be gated in by other [[major demon]]s, but cannot perform gating itself.

One of the [[hallucinatory monster]]s in ''NetHack'' - the [http://angband.oook.cz/monsters.php?q=The+ancient+multi-hued+dragon&t=2&s=&v= "ancient multi-hued dragon"] - is directly credited to ''Moria'' in the source code.

===Moria in variants===
[[UnNetHack]] has the [[Ruins of Moria]] branch, which draws heavily from Middle-Earth and even features a unique balrog, [[Durin's Bane]], as a boss monster. The third level also simulates a dungeon level found in a typical game of ''Moria''.

==Licensing==
NetHack is [[free]] and open source software under its [[Wikihack:NetHack General Public License|NetHack General Public License]]. Moria and its variants originally used a license which prohibited selling copies of the game. The practical effect of this is that operating systems like [[Debian]] originally classified NetHack as "free" and Moria as "non-free", and refused to include Moria when selling discs of the system. The [[Angband OpenSource Initiative]] was a successful attempt to change this: on January 9, 2009,<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.angband/msg/2db2fc9961d41c50</ref> Angband and Moria were completely dual licensed under the Moria license, and the GNU General Public License. (Moria had in fact been so dual licensed some time earlier, thanks to its lower number of contributors.)

The Moria license also did not contain explicit permission to modify the game, but modification is a strong tradition of the Moria community.

&&%s&& %s Light (monster class) {143965 2021-12-21T22:26:24Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Variants */ The '''light''' [[monster class]] contains monsters represented by {{white|y}}:

* {{monsymlink|yellow light}}
* {{monsymlink|black light}}

==Characteristics==
All lights will explode in your direction if you are adjacent, permanently destroying the light; this causes a [[property|status affliction]] and creates [[noise]] that can wake nearby monsters, but does no damage. As lights cannot [[see invisible]], if you are [[invisible]] or [[displaced]], they may explode at an empty square with no effect on you.

Reading a [[scroll of light]] while [[confused]] has a {{frac|5}} chance of summoning a light monster if they are not [[genocide]]d.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Reading the scroll while confused now instead summons multiple [[tame]] [[cancelled]] lights. An uncursed scroll will summon 3–4 yellow lights; a blessed scroll will summon 5–6 yellow lights; and a cursed scroll will summon 3–4 black lights. Nothing will be summoned if the appropriate type of light is genocided.}}

===Body parts===
Lights have a special hard-coded set of [[body parts]], with "hand" replaced with "ray", "handed" replaced with "rayed", and all other body parts replaced with "beam".{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|1729|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Variants==
Many variants add new monsters to the light monster class.

===Biodiversity patch===
Some variants implement the [[biodiversity patch]], which introduces the [[will o' wisp]]. Its exact traits vary with the variant in question; in the original patch, they explode and render you confused for several turns.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], [[coure eladrin]] take on the form of a mote of light, {{white|y}}, in order to flee and recover health; [[Queen Mab]] uses the form of a "coterie of motes", {{magenta|y}}, for similar purposes.

Additionally, a tiny being of light, {{cyan|y}}, appears as one of the many [[insight]] merchants.

===SlashTHEM===
[[SlashTHEM]] incorporates the will o' wisp, with most of the same traits as in the biodiversity patch.

===SpliceHack===
[[SpliceHack]] and [[SpliceHack-Rewrite|its rewrite]] both add the will o' wisp, but implement it differently from the biodiversity patch.

This template is used to create references to NetHack source code.

== Ambiguous references ==

Many old references on NetHackWiki look something like this:
 <nowiki>{{refsrc|allmain.c|42}}</nowiki>
which produces this footnote.{{refsrc|allmain.c|42}} These references don't specify which version of NetHack they're referencing, nor which directory the file is in, and thus are somewhat ambiguous. Redirect pages will attempt to patch these problems up (via assuming [[NetHack 3.4.3]], the statistically most common version at present). However, please try to specify at least the version explicitly, to avoid problems with future NetHack versions (most likely, for new references you don't want to cite 3.4.3 anyway).

== Good references ==

Good examples of references, including explicit versions and directoires:

 <nowiki>{{refsrc|src/allmain.c|42|version=NetHack 3.4.3}}</nowiki>
will produce this,{{refsrc|src/allmain.c|42|version=NetHack 3.4.3}} and
 <nowiki>{{refsrc|src/allmain.c|42|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}</nowiki>
will produce this.{{refsrc|src/allmain.c|42|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}

This is case-sensitive. Remember, no capital letters in "version", two capital letters in "NetHack".

Unlike the old ambiguous references, these references will not break as new versions of NetHack are released, and also make it easy to identify which articles are referenced to an old version (and thus may contain out-of-date information).

If a reference is to NetHack specifically, rather than a variant, you can abbreviate the reference, like this:
 <nowiki>{{refsrc|src/allmain.c|42|nethack=3.6.0}}</nowiki>
which produces this.{{refsrc|src/allmain.c|42|nethack=3.6.0}} This is not identical to specifying <code>version=NetHack 3.6.0</code>, but faster to write and saves space in the edit box. Alas, it would not eliminate the error message 'Page with an unversioned refsrc'. Again, as this is case-sensitive, "nethack" as a parameter name should have all small letters.

If you are referencing NetHack 3.6.x source code, you ''must'' specify a directory (such as src/ or include/), otherwise the GitHub link will be broken, such as this one:
  <nowiki>{{refsrc|allmain.c|42|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}</nowiki>
producing a 404 page: {{refsrc|allmain.c|42|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

== Referencing NetHack's [[variants]] ==

 <nowiki>{{refsrc|allmain.c|42|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</nowiki>
SLASH'EM code is stored on this wiki without the use of subdirectories, so for the time being, you'll need to omit those when referencing SLASH'EM code. The above example looks like this.{{refsrc|allmain.c|42|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

 <nowiki>{{refsrc|src/mkroom.c|123|unnethack=1406}}</nowiki>
UnNetHack allows you to link to a particular revision, rather than a particular version. It looks like this.{{refsrc|src/mkroom.c|123|unnethack=1406}} You will need to specify the subdirectory explicitly, because there is no filename list available for UnNetHack.

== Advanced usage ==

 <nowiki>{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|219|version=NetHack 3.4.3|comment=fleeing monsters stop holding you}}</nowiki>
You can include a comment along with the reference, as shown here.{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|219|version=NetHack 3.4.3|comment=fleeing monsters stop holding you}}

You may also specify a <tt>name</tt> parameter so you can reference the same location in the code from multiple locations in the text, like this:
 <nowiki>{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|814|version=NetHack 3.4.3|name=venom_letter}} [some other text...] <ref name='venom_letter'/></nowiki>
This will produce output like the following:{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|814|version=NetHack 3.4.3|name=venom_letter}} [some other text...] <ref name='venom_letter'/>

'''Maud''' is the object of affection in a poem of the same name by [[wikipedia:Alfred Lord Tennyson|Alfred Lord Tennyson]]. The poem describes the narrator's descent into fractured consciousness at the thought of his beloved. In [[NetHack]], Maud's name occurs in various aspects of the game, most often as possible names for [[ghost]]s appearing on special levels and in haunted [[temple]]s, as well as some of the [[player monster]]s on the [[Astral Plane]].

One of the [[unidentified scroll]] labels is DUAM XNAHT, or "THANX MAUD" written backwards, and is associated to the [[scroll of amnesia]] in the source code (although this has no effect on the chances of such a scroll having that label). Reading the scroll of amnesia itself causes you to forget several things and produces a message referencing the poem (either "Who was that Maud person anyway?" or "Thinking of Maud you forget everything else"). [[Player#Special names|Naming]] yourself Maud produces the same effect, but with [[TDTTOE|a different message]] about your mind turning inward on itself.

Get thee hence, nor come again,
Mix not memory with doubt,
Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,
Pass and cease to move about!
'Tis the blot upon the brain

For, Maud, so tender and true,
As long as my life endures
I feel I shall owe you a debt,
That I never can hope to pay;
And if ever I should forget
That I owe this debt to you
And for your sweet sake to yours;
O then, what then shall I say? -
If ever I should forget,
May God make me more wretched
Than ever I have been yet!

It is [[chaotic]]-aligned, and its [[base item]]-type is a [[crossbow]]. In all variants, Hellfire grants [[fire resistance]] when wielded.

SLASH'EM is the first variant that Hellfire appears in; it is one of two missile-launching artifacts first added to SLASH'EM, with the other being [[Plague]] (which also appears in the same variants as Hellfire).

===Generation===
As Hellfire can be randomly generated, and crossbows are relatively abundant, it is not uncommon to come across Hellfire lying about in the dungeon or in a weapon or armor [[shop]]. Hellfire can also be given as a [[sacrifice gift]] for chaotic players.

===Description===
Hellfire has a flat +5 to-hit bonus and +7 damage; [[crossbow bolt]]s fired from it cause fiery explosions in a 3x3 square centered on any target they hit, doing an additional 2d6 damage.{{refsrc|dothrow.c|1536|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}{{refsrc|explode.c|154|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/src/dothrow.c#L1651 SlashTHEM 0.9.6 dothrow.c, line 1651]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/src/explode.c#L154 SlashTHEM 0.9.6 explode.c, line 154]</ref>This also applies to monsters shooting bolts from Hellfire, with the bolt being destroyed on impact.{{refsrc|mthrowu.c|146|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}{{refsrc|explode.c|156|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/src/mthrowu.c#L175 SlashTHEM 0.9.6 mthrowu.c, line 175]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/src/explode.c#L156 SlashTHEM 0.9.6 explode.c, line 156]</ref>

===Strategy===
In theory, Hellfire is great for a character who wants to do a lot of ranged fighting, as it turns ordinary crossbow bolts into potent weapons. However, several caveats apply:

Due to the range of the explosions, you should avoid firing Hellfire at a target that is either point-blank range or adjacent to anything you don't want to hit, such as [[pet]]s, [[aligned priest]]s, and [[shopkeeper]]s. In addition, crossbows are two-handed weapons in SLASH'EM and its variants, making [[shield]]s of any kind an obstruction; SLASH'EM's increased blasting damage also means that cross-aligned players should avoid Hellfire in particular, as re-wielding the weapon each time you switch from melee to ranged combat will cause too much damage. Finally, the presence of rapid-fire [[heavy machine gun]]s and other [[firearm]]s make Hellfire less powerful than some mundane alternatives for most roles.

With all of this in mind, [[Rogue]]s and [[Ranger]]s are likely to benefit the most from discovering Hellfire - they can reach expert in [[crossbow]] skill, making Hellfire a viable alternative to firearms for them.

In dNetHack, Hellfire gives any bolts fired from it +1d4 to hit and +1 fire damage; the fiery explosion they create on a successful hit deals 6d6 damage and consumes the bolt.

In SlashTHEM, Hellfire is statistically unchanged from its appearance in SLASH'EM, but is now one of the many artifacts that can be created at [[The Forge]].<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/src/smith.c#L61 SlashTHEM 0.9.6 smith.c, line 61]</ref>
