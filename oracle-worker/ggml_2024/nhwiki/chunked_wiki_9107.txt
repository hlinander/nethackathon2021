When finally assigned the quest:
 "You are indeed ready, <playername>.  I shall tell you what has transpired,
 and why we so desperately need your help:
 "A short time ago, the mountain centaurs to the east invaded
 and enslaved the plains centaurs in this area.  The local
 leader is now only a figurehead, and serves Scorpius. 
 "During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
 hostile centaurs, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
 headed by Scorpius himself, managed to breach the grove and
 steal the Longbow of Diana.
 "Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
 we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.
 "If we are to survive, you, <playername>, must infiltrate
 the cave of the wumpus.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
 underground cavern of Scorpius.  He has always coveted
 the Longbow of Diana, and will surely keep it.
 "Recover the Longbow of Diana for us, <playername>!  Only then will <Venus | Mars> be safe."

====Encouragement====
If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "It is rumored that the Forest and Mountain Centaurs have resolved their ancient feud and now band together against us."
 "Scorpius is strong, and very smart."
 "Use the Longbow of Diana, when you find it.  It will help you survive to reach us."
 "Remember, let <Venus | Mars> be your guide."
 "Call upon <Venus | Mars> when you face Scorpius. The very act of doing so will infuriate him, and give you advantage."
 "Scorpius and his kind have always hated us."
 "We cannot hold the grove much longer, <playername>.  Hurry!"
 "To infiltrate the cave of the wumpus, you must be very stealthy."
 "Remember that Scorpius is a braggart.  Trust not what he says."
 "You can triumph, <playername>, if you trust in <Venus | Mars>."

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 This must be the cave of the wumpus.
 You are in a cave built of many different rooms, all interconnected
 by tunnels.  Your quest is to find and shoot the evil wumpus that
 resides elsewhere in the cave without running into any bottomless
 pits or using up your limited supply of arrows.  Good luck.
 You are in room 9 of the cave.  There are tunnels to rooms
 5, 8, and 10.
 *rustle* *rustle* (must be bats nearby)
 *sniff* (I can smell the evil wumpus nearby!)

When returning:
 Once again, you descend into the cave of the wumpus.
 *whoosh* (I feel a draft from some pits).
 *rustle* *rustle* (must be bats nearby)

When first entering the goal level:
 You descend into a weird place, in which roughly cut cave-like walls
 join with smooth, finished ones, as if someone was in the midst of
 finishing off the construction of a subterranean complex.
 Off in the distance, you hear a sound like the clattering of many
 hooves on rock.

When returning:
 Once again, you enter the distorted castle of Scorpius.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So, Ranger.  Orion has sent you to recover the Longbow of Diana.
 "Well, I shall keep that bauble.  It pleases me.  You, Ranger, shall die."

Upon further meetings:
 "Back again, eh?  Well, a mere <rank> is no threat to me!  Die, Ranger!"

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "You haven't learned your lesson, Ranger.  You can't kill me!  You shall die now."

When you have the Longbow of Diana, but Scorpius is still alive:
 "I shall have the Longbow of Diana from you, <rank>.  Then I shall
 kill you."

====Discouragement====
[[Scorpius]] will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "Your <Venus | Mars> is nothing, Ranger.  You are mine now!"
 "Run away little Ranger!  You can never hope to defeat Scorpius!"
 "My servants will rip you to shreds!"
 "I shall display your head as a trophy.  What do you think about that wall?"
 "I shall break your Orion's grove, and destroy all the Hunters!"
 "<Venus | Mars> has abandoned you, Ranger.  You are doomed."
 "A <rank>?  Orion sends a mere <rank> against me?  Hah!"
 "Orion has failed, Ranger.  The Longbow of Diana will never leave here."
 "You really think you can defeat me, eh Ranger?  You are wrong!"
 "You weaken, Ranger.  I shall kill you now."

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you pick up the Longbow of Diana, it seems to glow, and a warmth
 fills you completely.  You realize that its power is what has protected
 your <brothers|sisters> against their enemies for so long.
 You must now return it to Orion without delay -- their lives depend
 on your speed.

When killing the nemesis:
 Scorpius collapses to the ground, cursing you and Orion, then says:
    You have defeated me, <rank>!  But I curse you one final time, with my
    dying breath!  You shall die before you leave my castle!

When returning to your quest leader:
 "<playername>!  You have succeeded!  I feared it was not possible!
 "You have returned with the Longbow of Diana!
 "I fear, now, that the Centaurs will regroup and plot yet another raid.
 This will take some time, but if you can recover the Amulet of Yendor
 for <Venus | Mars> before that happens, we will be eternally safe.
 "Take the Longbow of Diana with you.  It will aid in your quest for
 the Amulet."

When subsequently throwing the Longbow of Diana to Orion:
 Orion flexs the Longbow of Diana reverently.
 "With this wondrous bow, one need never run out of arrows.
 You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your
 search for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return
 through the magic portal that brought you here."

===Post-quest===
When talking to Orion after the quest:
 "Welcome, <playername>.  How have you fared on your quest for the Amulet
 of Yendor?"

When talking to Orion after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "You have it!  You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor!
 Now attend to me, <playername>, and I will tell you what must be done:
 "The Amulet has within it magic, the capability to transport you to
 the Astral Plane, where the primary circle of <Venus | Mars> resides.
 "To activate this magic, you must travel upwards as far as you can.
 When you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to <Venus | Mars>.
 "Thus will you fulfill your destiny."

== Strategy ==
It is highly likely that one of the centaurs you have to deal with while travelling through the home level maze (on your way in or out) will have a wand of death or other attack wand. Have reflection to deal with this problem. Due to the length and linearity of the maze, it's best to be prepared to finish the Quest the first time you enter it, so you don't have to traverse it more than twice.

Due to the locate level's lack of actual walls, magic mapping will only show you the locations of the up and down stairs. The layout is static, however, so you can simply follow the provided map.

==History==
The [[Ranger]] role was introduced in [[NetHack 3.3.0]] as successor to the old Elf role, which was no longer tenable because Elf was now a [[race]]. NetHack 3.3.0 mostly recycled the Elf quest for the new Ranger role, changing the ''dramatis personae'' and the Quest artifact and not much else.

[[NetHack 3.3.1]] reworked the home and locate levels, introducing the labyrinth seen in the current Quest and the wumpus cave. The end level, though, is still the same one where the Goblin King once held court. The various messages are mostly similar to what the old Elf quest used.

'''The Absurd NetHack Tileset''' is a [[tileset]] for [[NetHack]] and [[SLASH'EM]] created by John Shaw.  It features large, realistic images of map features.  It was once available in 64x64, 72x72, 96x96 and 128x128 sizes.  Unfortunately these once-popular tilesets are no longer available at the [http://www.aesthetictech.8m.com/Absurd.htm official web site]. The page still exists, but the links point to a site that has been taken over by a domain squatter, and does not deliver the promised files. [http://web.archive.org/web/20030417005431/http://www.freewebs.com/aesthetictech/absurd.htm There is an archive] at the [http://www.archive.org/ Wayback Machine].

There is a copy of all tilesets except 96x96 at the [http://authenticinvention.com/nethack/absurd/ Authentic Invention] website.  Note that these tiles are for the older Nethack v3.43 and not the newer v3.6

== Wayback Machine Versions ==
Two sizes survive at the [http://www.archive.org/ Wayback Machine] inside slightly damaged zip files:

These versions are zipped and in the [http://www.libpng.org/ PNG] file format, and will need to be converted to BMP to use with the [[Microsoft Windows]] version of NetHack.  (Just load into Paint and then resave as BMP.  Be sure to select "24-bit bitmap" or the image will lose a lot of its quality.)

== Pre-converted .bmp versions ==
You can get these four sizes already converted from .png to .bmp files ready for use from a nethack fan's private webhost. Zipped and Unzipped versions provided.  The 96x96 version is at a different site; it did not survive either on the Wayback Machine or on Sourceforge.

There is a version available for [[SLASH'EM]], [http://blog.dirkz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/absurd-32-slashem-7e7f3.png here]

== Enabling the tile set for the windows version ==
# Download the desired size, 64x64 for this example.
# Convert to BMP if you have a .png
# Place in the directory with NetHackW.exe
# Open defaults.nh with a text editor.
# Add this line without the quotes to the file "'''OPTIONS=tile_file:absurd64.bmp,tile_width:64,tile_height:64'''".
# Change the number 64 all three times to match the size you downloaded.
# Save defaults.nh.
# Run NetHackW.exe and enjoy.


== Bug W343-2 ==
The [[DevTeam]] lists W343-2 as "not a bug" (more precisely, there's really nothing that can be done about it):

 Windows 98 is unable to load tiles that are too large. This is an OS issue.

Even the 64x64 size is larger than any other popular [[tileset]].  Thus Absurd is quite likely to be large enough to trigger this bug, and can be expected to do so on Windows 95 and Windows Me as well.  Users of these versions of Windows should probably choose another tileset.

{{todo|merge with [[Shell escape]]?}}

The '''^Z''' ({{kbd|ctrl|z}}) command suspends [[NetHack]] in environments that support this. ^Z is the usual [[Unix|*NIX]] shell keybind which suspends the foremost process, but NetHack is suspended using ^Z no matter what the current setting is. Windows' cmd.exe does not allow ^Z, but many *NIX shells will. When NetHack is suspended, the shell it was run from is brought into focus. NetHack is still alive, but it is frozen. Running the fg shell builtin will awaken NetHack.

NetHack sets the terminal to "raw mode", in which all incoming keystrokes go directly to the running program without any attempt by the device driver to interpret them.  A terminal which displays a shell prompt is usually in "cooked mode", in which such nice features as backspace, or Ctrl-C to stop a program, or Ctrl-Z for job control, are handled by the driver.  That's fine for a shell, which takes all input in complete lines terminated by the press of an ENTER or RETURN key; but it will not do for NetHack, which needs each key as it is, when it is pressed.  Thus NetHack has to provide its own support for such things as backspace when it is appropriate, and for Ctrl-Z.

When you press Ctrl-Z, the function <code>dosuspend</code>{{refsrc|ioctl.c|35|version=NetHack 1.3d|comment=the corresponding code in [[NetHack 3.4.3]] is in <code>sys/share/ioctl.c</code>, which has not been uploaded to {{SITENAME}}}} is called; at this level Ctrl-Z works like any other command. <code>dosuspend</code> sets the terminal back to "cooked mode" and then sends the signal SIGTSTP to NetHack itself, emulating the normal behavior of the terminal in "cooked mode".

If the signal SIGTSTP does not exist, then the job control is not supported, and Ctrl-Z does not work.  Most modern Unix-like systems support job control, including all versions of Linux and BSD.

{{RogueBasin}}

The ''Simple DirectMedia Layer'', commonly '''SDL''', is a library of the [[ANSI C|C language]] that provides low-level, cross-platform access to audio and video hardware and input devices. The same SDL user interface can compile and run on at least [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[X11]]. An SDL user interface will display either full screen, or in a single window.

SDL provides neither interface controls (as buttons and menus), nor fonts and text, nor audio encodings (as Ogg Vorbis), nor image encodings (as PNG). However, other libraries atop or along SDL can provide these things.

[[NetHack]] already has multiple interfaces for different platforms, but SDL is the basis of both the [[glHack]] and [[Vulture's]] interfaces.

----

The remainder of this page concerns the '''SDL''' interface to [[SLASH'EM]]. This is a port of the [[glHack]] interface, and resides in the <tt>win/gl</tt> directory of the SLASH'EM source code. At least one operating system provides a "slashem-sdl" package containing this interface.

== Features ==
The SDL interface can display the map as text or [[tiles]], and can allegedly load the same [[isometric]] tiles as the Gtk+ interface. Optionally, the SDL interface may use OpenGL to display the tiles; this compile-time option creates the ''GL'' interface.

Except for the map, the SDL interface resembles the [[tty]] interface. [[Message]]s appear at top, status appears in text at bottom (though in three lines instead of two), and menus appear in text format, without scroll bars or separate windows.

The SDL interface employs its own bitmap fonts to draw text, and the fonts provide full support for [[IBMgraphics]].

== Requirements ==
To build the SDL interface, you need the following:
* the SDL library
* the [[wikipedia:libpng|PNG library]], to load the tiles
* [[GNU]] [[make]]

If you enable OpenGL, then you also need the GL library.

The Makefile rules for this interface use a "%" syntax understood by GNU make, but not [[BSD]] make. [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1870830&group_id=9746&atid=309746 Bug 1870830] mentions this.

== Controls ==
Most of the controls and options for the SDL interface remain undocumented. One can put "GLOPTIONS" lines in the [[nethackrc]] but no document explains the options. However, the basic controls seem to be [PageUp] and [PageDown] to zoom the tiles, and [End] to toggle between tiles and text.

{{kbd|/}} is the '''what is''' [[commands|command]].  It has several functions for providing [[you]] with more information about the game. These functions include:
* Activating the [[far look]] mechanic to examine things on the map
* Displaying information about what a given [[ASCII|ASCII symbol]] represents
* Displaying the [[encyclopedia]] entry for a given symbol or topic

 
==Usage==
When you press {{kbd|/}}, first you will be given an opportunity to ''far look'' using cursor select:
 '''Specify unknown object by cursor? [ynq] (q)'''
* Choosing '''y''' will allow you to move to a symbol on the map using the movement keys
* Choosing '''n''' will prompt you to input an ASCII character or topic
* Choosing '''q''' will abort the command

===Cursor select===
If you choose to specify an object with the cursor, you will see:
 Please move the cursor to an unknown object. (For instructions type a ?)
If you press {{kbd|?}} for movement instructions, the following help text is displayed:
 Use 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' to move the cursor to an unknown object.
 Use 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L' to fast-move the cursor, 8 units at a time.
 Or enter a background symbol (ex. '<').
 Use '@' to move the cursor on yourself.
 Use 'm' or 'M' to move the cursor to next monster.
 Use 'o' or 'O' to move the cursor to next object.
 Use 'd' or 'D' to move the cursor to next door or doorway.
 Use 'x' or 'X' to move the cursor to unexplored location.
 Use 'a' or 'A' to move the cursor to anything interesting.
 Use '*' to change fast-move mode to skipping same glyphs.
 Use '!' to toggle menu listing for possible targets.
 Use '"' to change the mode of limiting possible targets.
 Use '#' to toggle automatic description.
 Type a '.' or ',' or ';' or ':' when you are at the right place.
   ':' describe current spot, show 'more info', move to another spot.
   '.' describe current spot, move to another spot;
   ',' describe current spot, move to another spot;
   ';' describe current spot, stop looking at things;
 Type Space or Escape when you're done.

You can also enter the symbol of a [[dungeon feature]] to move the cursor onto it ([[stairway]], [[altar]], closed [[door]], etc). For example, pressing {{kbd|>}} would jump the cursor to the stairs down, even if the stairs are covered by items.

The keys to move to next/previous monster/object/door and so on cycle through the possible targets by distance, unless you've toggled on the menu listing, in which case a menu with the possible targets is show. The possible targets can further be limited to those in line of sight or in the same area.

===ASCII symbol legend===
Once you select a square, you will be given a brief description of the symbol there. For example:
 +     a spellbook or closed door (closed door)
... or ...
 d     a dog or other canine (tame dog called Fido)
If your selection has an encylopedia entry, you will be able to get additional information.  In this case you will see:
 '''More info? [yn] (n)'''
* Choosing '''y''' displays the encylopedia information for your selection
* Choosing '''n''' lets you select another object with the cursor
Unset the [[Options#help|help option]] to avoid this prompt. You can also get the symbol legend for a character if you choose '''no''' to cursor select, and then type a single character. In this case you will not be prompted for more information, because there could be different encyclopedia entries for the things that symbol represents.

Compare selecting a [[staircase]] with cursor select:
 <     a staircase up or a ladder up (staircase up)
 '''More info? [yn] (n)'''
... vs. typing '''<''' ...
 '''Specify what? (type the word) <'''
 <     a staircase up or a ladder up

===Consulting the encyclopedia===
Choosing '''yes''' when asked for ''more info'', or typing in a complete word or phrase when asked to ''specify what'', will display the encyclopedia entry for that subject. Usually this is a lore reference from a real-world source (which may not be 100% accurate in NetHack), a brief writeup by the [[devteam]], or even a funny quote.  If there is nothing in the encylopedia for the phrase you entered, you will be told:
 I don't have any information on those things.
The encyclopedia has information about a vast array of subjects.  It is possible to be very specific when requesting information.  Compare the following examples:
  '''Specify what? (type the word) fog'''
  I don't have any information on those things.

  '''Specify what? (type the word) cloud'''
  I wandered lonely as a cloud
  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
  When all at once I saw a crowd,
  A host, of golden daffodils;
  Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
  Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
         [ I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud, by William Wordsworth ]

  '''Specify what? (type the word) fog cloud'''
  The fog comes
  on little cat feet.
  
  It sits looking
  over harbor and city
  on silent haunches
  and then moves on.
       [ Fog, by Carl Sandburg ]

==Strategy==
This command can be quite helpful to new players still learning what some of the symbols represent. This is especially true when facing unfamiliar monsters.  Cursor select can be used to tell if detected creatures are [[peaceful]].  It can also be helpful in verifying that you have acquired detection abilities such as [[telepathy]]—this can be used to help [[identify]] an [[amulet of ESP]] or a [[ring of warning]], for instance.

&&%s&& %s Far look {143294 2021-10-20T22:54:42Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{Keyboard Commands}}
The '''far look''' [[command]] is a feature in ''[[NetHack]]'', used by pressing the [[semicolon]] key ({{kbd|;}}), and lets you look at a [[square]] other than the one [[you]] are standing on.

==Description==
When you press {{kbd|;}}, you will be prompted to "<tt>pick an object.</tt>" See [[Targeting]] for more in-depth description of how to target with the cursor.

Choosing a square with a symbol present gives information about what the symbol can represent and what it actually is, such as:
 +     a spellbook or closed door (closed door)
... versus ...
 +     a spellbook or closed door (tan spellbook)
... or perhaps ...
 d     a dog or other canine (tame dog called Fido)
... compared to ...
 d     a dog or other canine (jackal) [seen:normal vision, infravision]

Far look will only inform you about a square if a symbol is present.

Far look is used to identify what a particular [[ASCII]] symbol represents, and often gives useful information about specific objects. A far-looked [[monster]] is denoted as [[peaceful]] or [[tame]] if applicable, and is otherwise hostile (as shown in the example above) - it will also display any name you have [[call]]ed them, which is handy for sorting out similar [[pet]]s. In the case of monsters that are beyond the normal field of vision, but still detected, it will tell you what detection method is being used (e.g., [[telepathy]] or [[infravision]]).

Far-looking objects will only give remembered information on that object if the item has been moved since it was last in your line of sight, treating that item as [[Blindness#Object_appearances|unseen]] (e.g., displaying "a wand" instead of "a wand of lightning named empty"). Items in line of sight will give more detailed information when far-looked.

==Options==
There are several [[option]]s that change the behaviour of farlook:

* [[autodescribe]]
* whatis_filter
* whatis_menu
* whatis_moveskip

The [[what is]] {{kbd|/}} and [[travel]] {{kbd|_}} commands make use of the same cursor select mechanic as the far look command. Using 'what is' may be preferable if you do not want the cursor resetting to your position after selecting a symbol - you can also press press {{kbd|,}} instead of {{kbd|.}} or {{kbd|;}} to avoid displaying the prompt for the [[encyclopedia]] entry, or unset the [[Options#help|help option]].

The effect is not usually as strong as if the potion had been [[quaff]]ed instead. If you are standing in a [[square]] adjacent to where the potion shatters, you can still be affected by the vapors released. For this reason, you should be careful when throwing harmful potions at nearby opponents.

Vapors can also be released if a potion you are carrying gets shattered by something that can vaporize it (such as a [[fire]] or [[lightning]]). Potions on the ground can be shattered by nearby explosions or blasts from harmful [[wand]]s. Similarly, bashing open a locked [[container]] can shatter potion bottles inside, releasing vapors. A potion can also break if dropped while [[flying]] or [[levitating]].

[[Alchemy]] accidents will also release potion vapors.

Vapors can be inhaled ("''You smell a peculiar odor''"), or they can come in to contact with your eyes ("''Your eyes water''"). Thus, being [[breathless]] does not save you from vapors unless you also [[eyeless|have no eyes]]. 

Monsters are not affected by vapors, only by potions that directly hit them.

In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''apport''' is a statistic that represents how likely a [[pet]] is to 'fetch' items and bring them to [[you]].

==Description==
"Apport" is the name of a variable field in <tt>struct edog</tt> that governs the chances of a pet picking up an item and dropping it on a square next to you.{{refsrc|include/mextra.h|162|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} The higher the apport stat is, the more likely a pet is to bring you an item.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|446|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=chance of picking up an object depends on distance and apport}}{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|421|version=NetHack 3.6.6|chance of dropping a carried object}} New pets start with an apport equal to your current [[charisma]].{{refsrc|src/dog.c|42|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Apport can be increased by feeding your pet any [[comestible]] that qualifies as a [[treat]] shortly after it has dropped an item near you. While this is commonly done by throwing the treat to the pet, the only requirement for treats to increase apport is that it has been in your inventory previously.

Apport is decremented by 1 each time the pet drops an item, to a minimum of 1.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|423|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

The exact formula for apport gain (calculated when the pet receives a treat) is:{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|295|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}
 200 / ((distance from you to pet when the last item was dropped) + (# of turns since item was dropped))

Ideally, if a pet drops an item right next to you, and you immediately throw it a treat, the calculation would be:
 200 / (1 [[square]] + 1 [[turn]]) =  200/2  = +100 apport

==Strategy==
Apport is best raised and maintained by immediately rewarding a pet for dropping an item at your feet; this will raise initial apport high enough for the pet to start seeking you out, after which you should treat your pet from time to time after it drops something to keep apport high. [[Knight]]s (who start with a [[pony]] and many [[carrot]]s and [[apple]]s) and [[Healer]]s (who can turn [[rock]]s into [[meatball]]s via [[stone to flesh]]) are the roles most immediately prepared to handle this kind of training.

==Etymology==
The term "apport" is derived from the archaic English word "[[Wiktionary:apporter|apporter]]" and the much more common French ''apporter'' of the same spelling; their common root is the Latin ''apportō'' (“I carry in”). The former refers to an importer, while the latter is a verb that can mean "to bring (in)".

In many languages, "apport" is a widely used command in dog training, equivalent to "fetch".<ref>https://www4.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/languag1.htm</ref><ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/apport#Swedish</ref>

'''Tameness''' is a measure of how resistant your [[pet]] is to going untame. Tameness is a value from 1 to 20. For carnivorous pets, the scale means something like this:
* 1 = nearly wild: Your pet might go wild ([[peaceful]] or [[hostile]]) soon if you somehow become level-separated or abuse it before it eats.
* 5 = tame: Your pet can stand to be level-separated from you for a brief amount of time.
* 10 = domesticated: Your pet can handle being level-separated from you for quite some time.
* 15 = loyal: Your pet can stand to be level-separated for a long time, and will even put up with accidental abuse.
* 20 = fiercely loyal: Your pet can be level-separated for a very long time, and will even put up with occasional abuse.

You can #[[chat]] with [[domestic animal|cats, dogs, and horses]] to get a general indication of how tame they are, although other factors such as [[hunger]], [[confusion]], fright, or being caught in a [[trap]] can make this difficult. In general, [[dog]]s will whine, [[cat]]s will yowl, and [[horse]]s will neigh if they are not content (tameness below 5, or possibly just hungry). Get them some [[food]] as soon as possible to see if that helps. A [[stethoscope]] can help you sort out some of the state conditions and works on any species, but does not diagnose the level of tameness.

== Initial tameness ==
The tameness of new pets depends on their species, not on the method of taming. [[Domestic animal]]s and your [[Astral Plane]] guardian angel start with a tameness of 10; all others start with 5.{{refsrc|dog.c|16}}{{refsrc|dog.c|1403}}

Exceptions:
* Hatchlings of eggs [[Oviparous|laid by you]] have a tameness of 20.{{refsrc|timeout.c|449}}
** Dragon eggs and eggs outside your main [[inventory]] will only hatch with tameness 5.
* If a pet divides (such as [[pudding]]s and [[gremlin]]s), only the original retains its tameness and any further stats.{{refsrc|makemon.c|742}}{{refsrc|makemon.c|765}} The clone is a freshly tamed monster. It will have the same name, but appear at a nearby spot. (Attacking it can untame a pudding before it splits. Some clones caused by the player are hostile.)
* Pets that are [[amulet of life saving|life-saved]] or [[revive]]d from the dead keep their tameness from before, ''if'' they come back tame. There's always a chance they will be revived hostile.
** Past transgressions ([[#Abuse|abuse]]) are remembered. Abused pets might be wild or feral. If you killed the pet, it will be understandably mad about that.
* Pets from a former adventurer's [[bones]] file will be hostile. Re-tame them or kill them.

== Increasing tameness ==
* Tameness increases by +1 when a pet eats.
** [[Carnivore]]s and [[Omnivore]]s are easy to keep tame because they will eat [[corpse]]s.
** [[Metallivore]]s are easy to keep tame because they will eat metal [[junk]].
** [[Herbivore]]s can be kept tame by carefully managing your [[comestible]]s.
** [[Inediate|Monsters that do not eat]] are difficult to keep tame. Do not abuse them or leave them on other dungeon levels.
* Reading the [[blessed]] [[Book of the Dead]] will increase tameness of coaligned undead pets by +1 (and can tame nearby undead).

== Decreasing tameness ==
Pets will only become hostile if abandoned on a different dungeon level for a very long time, or if revived after being abused.{{fact}} In all other cases, they end up peaceful when their tameness reaches zero.

* Attacking your pet, displacing it onto a trap, or unsuccessfully [[untrap]]ping it from a [[bear trap]] reduces tameness by 1.
** If you [[aggravate monster]]s or are causing [[conflict]], tameness is cut in half instead.<ref>{{function|dog.c|abuse_dog}}</ref>
** Be very careful with [[arrow]]s and other projectiles when your pet is directly behind a monster you are attacking.
* A pet left on a different level for at least 75 turns loses 1 tameness, and an additional point every 150 turns thereafter.{{refsrc|dog.c|446}}
** A pet reduced to zero this way will either become hostile or peaceful.
*** Peaceful-only is a myth. The chance of a hostile outcome is (previous_tameness) / tameness_loss. To guarantee a peaceful ex-pet, you must visit its level within 149 turns after tameness reaches zero.{{refsrc|dog.c|450}}
** A pet that would have starved to death in this situation will always go hostile.
** Throwing food at a former pet will anger it, unless it is a [[domestic animal]].
* If you displace a trapped pet, there is a 1 in [tameness] chance that it will become hostile.{{refsrc|hack.c|1290}}
* A pet that becomes unleashed by a trap ([[level teleport]], [[trap door]], [[hole]], etc.) loses 1 point of tameness.
* A pet choked by a cursed [[leash]] may lose 1 point of tameness. This will never reduce tameness below 1.{{refsrc|apply.c|578}}
** The chance of this &minus;1 loss being waived is 1 in [tameness]. So the higher the current tameness, the more likely you lose 1 point.
** Cursed leashes are very bad for keeping pets tame, but a pet will never turn on you solely because of the cursed leash.
*** Be extra careful around traps if your pet is on a cursed leash, as pushing your pet into a trap can put it over the edge.
*** Also watch out for [[stun]] or [[confusion]] states; if you accidentally hit your pet, it could be the last straw.
*** Never wield [[Stormbringer]] if your leash is cursed. (Actually, just don't wield it around pets, period.) [[Cleaver]] merits caution as well.
* &minus;1 tameness every time you use #[[ride]] to try to mount a [[saddle]]d pet, unless you are a [[knight]]. Tameness also influences your chance of success.
** &minus;1 tameness for [[kick]]ing or [[whip]]ping your mount (although this can make it [[gallop|move faster]]).
** It can be dangerous to try to ride a pet with very low tameness. Feed it first if you can.
** A non-eating pet will, in this situation, become peaceful if its tameness reaches zero.

==Abuse==
Pets additionally have an abuse counter and keep track whether you killed it. [[Revive]]d, unstoned, or life-saved pets will come back non-tame if you killed it or abused it at least three times.<ref>{{function|dog.c|wary_dog}}</ref> There is a one-in-tameness chance it comes back non-tame anyway.

Both counters are reset to zero when (re)tamed,<ref>{{function|dog.c|tamedog}}, {{function|dog.c|initedog}}</ref> revived, unstoned, or life-saved.<ref>{{function|zap.c|Montraits}} keeps the abuse counter, but {{function|dog.c|wary_dog}} later resets them.</ref> A [[pudding]] freshly split off another pet is reset to zero abuse and five tameness.{{refsrc|makemon.c|765}}

The abuse counter is incremented each time you score an attack on pet or displace it into a damaging trap. This includes "attacking" with healing potions. Polymorph, teleport, and levelport traps are fine, as they don't damage the pet. Strangely, zapping a spell or wand at your pet is not considered abuse.

== Strategy ==
In most cases, as long as you stay on the same level as your pet, and keep it from going hungry, your pet will stay loyal to you. Consider #[[pray]]ing if both you and your pet are hungry; pets don't really have that option. If you fall down a hole or step on a level teleport and leave your pet behind, try to go back for it as soon as you can. If your pet gets lost in such a manner, it may be harder to figure out where the pet ended up. [[Telepathy]] or a [[magic whistle]] might help you quickly check the nearby floors. If you favor exotic pets, have a spare source of taming so you can recover from unfortunate separating circumstances. If you don't manage to find your old pet, you can always try to charm a new one. Laying eggs as a [[gargoyle]] or [[cockatrice]] can score you a very loyal pet, and laying eggs as a dragon gets you a pretty strong one.

A '''herbivore''' is a creature that (when [[tame]]d) prefers to eat vegetable matter such as [[fruit]], vegetables, [[fungus|fungi]], and other plants. [[Apple]]s and [[carrot]]s are considered [[treat]]s. They will seek out and eat safe [[vegan]] [[corpse]]s such as [[lichen]]s, [[mold]], [[shrieker]]s, [[blob]]s, and [[jelly|jellies]]. They will also eat [[melon]]s, [[orange]]s, [[pear]]s, [[wolfsbane]], [[garlic]], [[kelp frond]]s, and so on, but only when hungry. This applies if they happen to be on it or you throw it to them. If they are starving ("confused from hunger"), they will seek out and eat some people food like [[food ration]]s, [[pancake]]s, and [[lembas]]. They will never eat meat products, meaty corpses, [[egg]]s, or [[tin]]s. For the full list, see [[Diet#Pets|Diet § Pets]].

When a herbivorous pet is used as a [[steed]], it won't eat vegetables other than apples and carrots while you ride it, even if hungry. It will only do so when starving (which divide maximum hit points by 4). So if you don't have any apples and carrot and can't heal your pet, you might want to dismount it to feed it some fruits when it's hungry. For non-[[Knight]] players, this will keep [[tameness]] unchanged (+1 for feeding and &minus;1 for remounting it).

Herbivores can be difficult [[pet]]s to keep fed, especially for [[Monk]]s, who share a similar diet unless they decide to take the small [[alignment record|alignment penalty]] for non-vegetarian food. You might want to [[chat]] to your pet regularly so you know when you can throw it food.

Players polymorphed into herbivores are perfectly capable of eating meat.

Inediate [[pet]]s can sometimes be difficult to keep tame, as eating is a primary method of increasing a pet's [[tameness]].

An "inediate" player who completes the game without eating is said to have achieved the [[foodless]] conduct.

Generally, [[monster]]s that are [[undead]], [[demon]]ic, [[angel]]ic, or otherwise magical in nature are inediate; there are a handful of exceptions, such as [[ghoul]]s. Some creatures that eat in the real world, like bees and fungi, are classified as inediate in ''NetHack''.

&&%s&& %s Gallop {140594 2021-06-02T03:53:53Z {4001483 Cathartes} more precise description of the failure condition, based on reading the source code in kick_steed() A [[steed]] can be made to '''gallop''' by [[kick]]ing or [[apply]]ing a whip while [[riding]].  If successful, this will cause the mount's [[movement rate]] to randomly increase for certain types of movement.  If unsuccessful, the rider will be forcefully dismounted from the steed.  Tameness is reduced by 1 when kicking or whipping the mount, so use this function sparingly.  A rider with a high [[experience level]] on a pet with a high [[tameness]] has the greatest chance of success.  Specifically, kicking a steed will dismount the player if the sum of the player's experience level and the steed's tameness (''after'' kicking) is less than [[rnd]](20), or if the steed was made untame.  Thus, if experience level+tameness is at least 21 ''before'' kicking, the steed will always gallop if it remains tame after kicking.

Galloping will last for 30-49 turns.{{refsrc|steed.c|406}}  Movement that benefits from the speed boost is any command that causes multiple movements, such as {{kbd|shift|H}}, {{kbd|9}}{{kbd|H}}, {{kbd|_}}, etc. (In the sourcecode, movement that sets <tt>flags.mv</tt> will benefit from the gallop speed increase.{{refsrc|cmd.c|1930}}{{refsrc|cmd.c|1939}}{{refsrc|mon.c|505}})  Each turn of galloping with eligible movement, the steeds speed is increased temporarily by either four-thirds (~1.33) or five-thirds (~1.67), averaging 1.5 times its non-galloping speed.{{refsrc|mon.c|507}}

The rules for what commands are eligible for speed boosts lead to some counterintuitive strategies.  If you are 1 space away from a wall and want to move up against the wall, using {{kbd|shift|H}} or {{kbd|2}}{{kbd|H}} will give you the speed boost with no other consequences, while simply pressing {{kbd|H}} will not (if the [[number_pad]] [[option]] is on, you can use {{kbd|5}} and then a direction.).  Moving everywhere using {{kbd|_}} [[travel]] will give you the speed boosts, even if you're only moving 1 space each time.{{refsrc|cmd.c|1904}}

&&%s&& %s Schroedinger's Cat {144474 2022-02-13T23:32:12Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* Description */ [[revive]], not [[turn undead]] In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''Schroedinger's Cat''' is the name of a [[housecat]] that is generated in the possession of a [[quantum mechanic]]. 

==Description==
{{main|Quantum mechanic|Housecat}}
Quantum mechanics have a 5% chance of being generated with a special [[large box]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|680|nethack=3.6.0}} This box will contain a housecat that is either alive or dead; the state of the cat is not fixed until it is observed by opening the box. When the box is opened, there is a 50% chance the game will attempt to create a [[peaceful]] live housecat named "Schroedinger's Cat" as close as possible to the player. If the 50% chance fails (or housecats are genocided or the level has no square free for a monster), the box will contain a named housecat [[corpse]] instead.{{reffunc|pickup.c|observe_quantum_cat}}

Besides its name and unusual origin, Schroedinger's Cat is just a normal housecat; you may [[domestic animal|tame it with food]], kill it for [[experience]], or even change its name with the [[call]] command. If Schroedinger's Cat is generated as dead, you can [[revive]] it, though it will be hostile.

The state of the cat is not fixed until it is observed in any fashion, either by opening the box or by [[tip]]ping it. Before the box containing Schroedinger's Cat is opened, it is technically empty, but its weight is increased to account for the weight of the cat.{{refsrc|src/mkobj.c|1341|nethack=3.6.0|comment=weight of special boxes is adjusted to include cat}} In particular, neither [[telepathy]] nor [[monster detection]] will show a live cat in the box, nor will [[food detection]] show its corpse; however, a [[wand of probing]] will say that the box ''seems'' empty.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], probing will simply show the box as empty. This was [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-263|bug C343-263]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Schrödinger's cat}}
"Schrödinger's cat" refers to a famous thought experiment in quantum mechanics involving imagining locking a cat in a box with a mechanism that has a 50% chance of killing the cat, depending upon the final state of a quantum system - for example, whether an unstable nucleus has decayed within a certain time.

The orthodox [[wikipedia:Copenhagen interpretation|Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics asserts that the cat in the box is in a superposition of possible outcomes, in half of which the cat is dead, and half of which it is alive. Only when the box is opened and "observed" does the quantum wavefunction collapse, and the fate of the cat become determined. Schrödinger constructed the thought experiment in order to assert that this, and by extension the Copenhagen interpretation, was absurd; as of this writing, physicists are still divided on this matter. 

==Messages==
{{message|The housecat inside the box is still alive!|Schroedinger's Cat is alive - a housecat is generated in the square nearest to the large box.}}
{{message|You think something brushed your foot.|As above, but you cannot see the housecat.}}
{{message|The housecat inside the box is dead!|Schroedinger's Cat is dead - a [[housecat]] corpse is in the large box.}}
{{message|The large box seems empty.|You probed the large box.}}

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Imagine a sealed container, so perfectly constructed that no physical influence can pass either inwards or outwards across its walls.  Imagine that inside the container is a cat, and also a device that can be triggered by some quantum event.  If that event takes place, then the device smashes a phial containing cyanide and the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives on.  In Schroedinger's original version, the quantum event was the decay of a radioactive atom.  ...  To the outside observer, the cat is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only when the container is finally opened would the cat's state vector collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably protected) observer inside the container, the cat's state-vector would have collapsed much earlier, and the outside observer's linear combination has no relevance.

Weapons are listed above first by skill class, then by increasing damage.
Alternative Japanese names are listed in parentheses ().  The COST field
denotes the base price of each weapon.  WGT specifies the weight (100
zorkmids weighs 1); an asterisk (*) signifies that the weapon requires
two hands to wield.

Weapons comprise 10% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
0% in containers, 12% on the Rogue level, and 20% in hell.  PROB is the
relative probability of each subtype.  If an object is mergable, then
6d6 (6 to 36) quantity is generated.  Weapons have a roughly 10% chance
of being blessed, roughly 10% of being cursed, and roughly 10% chance of
a non-zero enchantment (exponentially distributed).  Poisonable weapons
(all arrows, crossbow bolts, darts, and shuriken) have a 1% chance of
being generated poisoned.  Pick axes, unicorn horns, grappling hooks,
gems, glass, rocks, two-weapon combat, riding, bare-handed combat, and
martial arts are also listed here for their weapon skills and damage,
even though they are not technically weapons.

The MATL column describes the material of the weapon.  This affects
whether the weapon can be damaged (eroded); see the section below to
find out how to repair and prevent damage.
