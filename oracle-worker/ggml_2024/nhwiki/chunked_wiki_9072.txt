== Trivia ==
Horses belong to a class of animals called 'ungulates' which are primarily characterized by having hooves&mdash;hence the {{brown|u}} that symbolizes them.

While polymorphed into a horse, you can't wear items. Trying to do so will produce the message "Don't even bother!". Similarly with wielding("Don't be ridiculous!").

A '''mastodon''' is a large, thick-skinned, [[herbivore]] that is not very common in the dungeon.

==Biology==

To be precise, mastodons are a group of species. Not a single species. While the mastodon does resemble the modern [[wikipedia:elephant|elephant]], the modern elephant is not a direct descendant of the mastodon.

==Strategy==

Although having a moderate speed as compared to [[horse|horses]], mastodons can be [[tame]]d for the purposes of [[riding]]. Since it has a very good attack, it will make a strong melee-fighting pet.

Consider zapping a tame mastodon (as with any [[motile]] pet) with a [[wand of speed monster]], particularly if you are riding it and/or don't have a [[magic whistle]].

Note that in [[SLASH'EM]] they are represented by {{brown|q}}, identical to the far less dangerous [[rothe]].

==Encyclopedia entry==

}}[[Centaur]] is a [[monster class]] in NetHack. Centaurs come in three varieties:
* plains centaur
* forest centaur
* mountain centaur

A centaur is a [[monster]] that is a particular cross between a [[human (monster attribute)|human]] and a [[horse]]; it has the body and legs of a horse, but where the horse's head would be, it instead has the upper body, arms, head, and face of a human. Centaurs can wield [[weapon]]s and use magic items, but unlike many other [[intelligent]] monsters, centaurs can also move fast and they can [[kick]] you.

==Generation==
Centaurs have a 50% chance to [[Monster starting inventory|be generated with]] a [[launcher]] and [[missile]]s; a forest centaur gets a [[bow]] and 3–14 [[arrow]]s, while the other varieties get a [[crossbow]] and 3–14 [[crossbow bolt|bolt]]s.

Some centaurs may start [[peaceful]].

==Strategy==
===Combat===
Centaurs are dangerous in [[melee]]; their rapid and repeated use of wielded weapons (or bare-handed combat) combined with kicking can quickly harm or kill your character. A centaur with ranged weapons may shoot you. Shoot back or send your [[pet]].

=== As a pet ===
Centaurs can use:
* [[Weapon]]s
* [[Shield]]s
* [[Helm]]s
* [[Gloves]]
* [[Amulets of life saving]]
* [[Unicorn horn]]s
* [[Potions of gain level]]

Centaurs make superb [[steed]]s; while not quite as fast as a [[unicorn]] or a [[warhorse]], a centaur is still very fast—a mountain centaur has a base speed of 20 and when zapped with a [[wand of speed monster]] is even faster than a player in speed boots. And unlike a unicorn or warhorse, a well-equipped centaur can take quite a beating, even in [[Gehennom]]. They can return quite a beating too: a centaur is the only steed that can wield a weapon, and given a powerful weapon (perhaps a throwaway artifact weapon from sacrificing) can easily match the damage dealt by a [[dragon]] or a [[jabberwock]].

Centaurs are very easy to keep fed, which is of particular importance where steeds are concerned. Every time you attempt to ride a steed, its [[tameness]] is decreased by one (except for [[Knight]]s). While [[ki-rin]] are sometimes regarded as the "best" steeds, they do not eat, and thus they are notoriously difficult for non-Knights to keep tame. Just take care if you kill a [[shapeshifter]]: unless you dismount first and dispose of the corpse, your centaur is very likely to get to the corpse first if you ride over it. 

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Pets will no longer eat corpses that make them polymorph, unless they are starving or on the verge of becoming untame.}}

Centaurs cannot fly, so as with all land-based steeds, take care around [[water]], and [[ice]] too for that matter—it is very easy to slip off the steed on water you've frozen and then displace your steed into the unfrozen water, drowning it. [[Polymorph trap]]s are not a problem for the centaur if the player has [[magic resistance]]: this will protect the steed too while you are riding it. The player's reflection will not transfer to the steed, but a centaur can wear a [[shield of reflection]].

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Riding while wearing an [[amulet of flying]] will cause the steed to fly as well—riding a mountain centaur with an amulet or shield of reflection paired with an artifact weapon can make them a somewhat viable competitor to the [[ki-rin]]. However, be sure to keep a [[wand of undead turning]] handy in case they die.}}

== EvilHack ==
{{main|EvilHack#New player races}}

[[EvilHack]] adds centaurs as a playable [[race]]. Player and monster centaurs can wear all armor, except boots.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

The two-way magic portal back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point at the top right. Pelias occupies the throne; there are four chieftains in the same room, and two more each in the hidden alcoves (the upper of which contains a chest, the lower the downstair). One giant eel is in the upper part of the river, and two in the lower; there are eleven ogres on the right bank of the river, in front of the crossing with the marked spiked pit.
The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls and floor.

The right half of the level (marked by green dots) is a forest, with some floor tiles replaced by [[tree]]s.  The tree density grows towards the right edge (from 5% to 20%), but there is always a path from the portal to the crossing. All trees are petrified and cannot be chopped down.

===Upper filler level===

This an unlit, completely open level, lacking even the customary undiggable [[solid rock]] at the borders. It contains a rock troll, two ogres, and a random O; eight random objects; and four random traps.

There are two ogres on the island, four ogres and two rock trolls in the large room of the main building, eight ogres and two rock trolls just behind the secret entrance to the caves, and another rock troll on the downstair; there are a further three ogres, a random O, two rock trolls and two random T placed randomly around the level. In addition to the four marked spiked pits, there are four other random traps on the level. The two hidden side rooms above and below the entrance hall of the main building contain seven and five random objects respectively; there are a further three random objects in the back cavern near the downstair.
The entire level has an undiggable floor. Teleportation is permitted.

===Lower filler level(s)===

These are cavern levels, with three rock trolls, seven ogres, a random O, and a random T; eleven random objects; and four random traps.

[[Thoth Amon]], with the Bell of Opening and the Heart of Ahriman, is at the marked cross-aligned altar. Randomly placed on the level are sixteen ogres, two random O, eight rock trolls, and a random T; fourteen random objects; and six random traps. The walls of the Lair are undiggable; teleportation is permitted.

Experienced players may notice that this level bears a significant resemblance to [[Mines' End|The Mimic of the Mines]].

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 Warily you scan your surroundings, all of your senses alert for signs
 of possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can <see|sense> the familiar shapes
 of the camp of the Duali Tribe.
 But why, you think, should Pelias be there?
 Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
 evil magic in the air.
 Without thought, you ready your weapon, and mutter under your breath:
     "By <deity>, there will be blood spilt today."

Next time:
 Once again, you near the camp of the Duali Tribe.  You know that Pelias
 will be waiting.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
 the camp of the Duali Tribe.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
 "Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
 "There has been little treasure to loot, since the horde arrived."
 "The horde is mighty in numbers, but they have little courage."
 "Pelias is a strange one, but he has helped defend us."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
 "Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
 "Times will be good again, now that the horde is vanquished."
 "You have brought our clan much honor in defeating Thoth Amon."
 "You will be a worthy successor to Pelias."

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 "Ah, <playername>.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
 need of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.
 "But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "<playername>, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"

This message is not currently used:

 "Again, you stand before me, <playername>.  Surely you have prepared yourself."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, <player>.  You will never attain
 the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
 closed this future to you.
 "I will protect these people as best I can, but soon Thoth Amon will overcome
 me and destroy all who once called you <brother|sister>.  Now begone!"

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "<playername>, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
 Thoth Amon.  Only a Raider with the help of <Crom|Set> could ever hope to
 defeat him."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "<playername>!  You have wandered from the path of the <balance|chaos>!
 If you attempt to overcome Thoth Amon in this state, he will surely
 enslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
 Go forth, and return when you feel ready."

When finally assigned the quest:

 "The world is in great need of your assistance, <playername>.
 "About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
 as Thoth Amon, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
 about him.
 "At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
 potent magical talisman, the Heart of Ahriman, from a Turanian caravan.
 "Thoth Amon and his Black Horde swept down upon the Duali Oasis and defeated 
 the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken 
 the Heart of Ahriman, and seeks to bend it to his will. I detected the 
 subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people. 
 Then I sent forth a summons for you.
 "If Thoth Amon can bend the Heart of Ahriman to his will, he will become
 almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
 men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
 and with <Crom|Set> behind you, you alone can defeat Thoth Amon.
 "You must go to the Duali Oasis.  From there, you can track down
 Thoth Amon, defeat him, and return the Heart of Ahriman to us.  Only
 then will the world be safe."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "Thoth Amon is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
 "Remember that Thoth Amon is a great sorcerer.  He lived in the time
 of Atlantis."
 "If you fail, <playername>, I will not be able to protect these people long."
 "To enter the Duali Oasis, you must be very stealthy.  The horde will be on
 guard."
 "Call upon <Crom|Set> in your time of need."
 "May <Crom|Set> protect you, and guide your steps."
 "If you can lay hands upon the Heart of Ahriman, carry it for good fortune."
 "I cannot stand against Thoth Amon's sorcery.  But <Crom|Set> will help you."
 "Do not fear Thoth Amon. I know you can defeat him."
 "You have a great road to travel, <playername>, but only after you defeat
 Thoth Amon."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:

 The scent of water comes to you in the desert breeze.  You know that
 you have located the Duali Oasis.

When returning:

 Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate the Duali Oasis.

When first entering the goal level:

 The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
 very air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
 make you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of Thoth Amon.

When returning:

 Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer Pelias sends to do his bidding.
 I have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.
 "Prepare to die, Barbarian."

Upon further meetings:

 "I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "You return yet again, Barbarian!  Are you prepared for death now?"

When you have the Heart of Ahriman, but Thoth Amon is still alive:

 "I shall have the Heart of Ahriman back, you pitiful excuse for a Barbarian.
 And your life as well."

====Discouragement====

Thoth Amon will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
 "You are a sorry excuse for a <currentrank>."
 "Run while you can, Barbarian.  My next spell will be your last."
 "I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
 "<Crom|Set> cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
 "Your <neutral|chaotic> nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
 "Come, Barbarian.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your tribe."
 "Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off Pelias, and your tribe."
 "Fight, Barbarian, or are you afraid of the mighty Thoth Amon?"
 "You have failed, Barbarian.  Now, my victory is complete."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Heart of Ahriman, you feel the power of it
 flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
 at once, even though you are holding it.

When killing the nemesis:

 Thoth Amon falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then his
 body fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
 slowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
 begun to fade.

When returning to your quest leader:

 When Pelias sees the Heart of Ahriman, he smiles, and says:
     Well done, <playername>.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
     What, now, should be done with the Heart of Ahriman?
     These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
     other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as Thoth Amon did.
     Take the Heart of Ahriman with you, <playername>.  It will guard you in
     your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
     quest far greater than you realize.
     Remember me, <playername>, and return when you have triumphed.  I
     will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
     time comes.

When subsequently throwing the Heart of Ahriman to Pelias:

 Pelias gazes reverently at the Heart of Ahriman, then back at you.
 "You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
 for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the
 magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Pelias after the quest:

 "Tell us, <playername>, have you fared well on your great quest?"

When talking to Pelias after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:

 "This is wondrous, <playername>.  I feared that you could not possibly
 succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
 of Yendor!
 "I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In

 "As you now possess the amulet, <playername>, I suspect that the Book

== Strategy ==
The large number of trolls can present a challenge to players who can't keep them from reviving. A carnivorous or omnivorous [[pet]] is the simplest solution, although it will take several turns to eat each corpse.

'''Mitra''' is the [[lawful]] [[god]] of the [[Barbarian]] pantheon.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Originating in India (Mitra), Mithra is a god of light who
was translated into the attendant of the god Ahura Mazda in
the light religion of Persia; from this he was adopted as
the Roman deity Mithras.  He is not generally regarded as a
sky god but a personification of the fertilizing power of
warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both
plants and animals.  His chief adversary is Ahriman, the
power of darkness.

Warily Conan scanned his surroundings, all of his senses alert
for signs of possible danger.  Off in the distance, he could

Suddenly, the hairs on his neck stand on end as he detects the

{{religion}}

'''Set''' is the [[chaotic]] [[god]] of the [[Barbarian]] pantheon.  Set's high priest is [[Thoth Amon]], the Barbarian [[quest nemesis]].

==Mythology==
The origin of Set as a NetHack deity is unclear.  Set(h) is the name of a god in ancient Egyptian mythology, but Set is also the name of a major deity in the ''Conan'' series by American author [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Howard Robert E. Howard].  The neutral Barbarian god [[Crom]] is also from the ''Conan'' series, so it would seem that the Hyborian god is meant; however, the [[NetHack 3.6.0]] [[encyclopedia]] entry for Set describes the Egyptian god.

In the ''Conan'' series, Set, the serpent-god of darkness, is depicted as a seven-headed snake, and is primarily worshipped by wicked cults.

Set is first mentioned in the first Conan short story, ''The Phoenix on the Sword'', published in 1932. He is extensively used in Marvel Comics' Conan series from the 1970s through 1990s as an infernally powerful antagonist.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The ancient Egyptian god of chaos (Set), the embodiment of hostility and even of outright evil.  He is also a god of war, deserts, storms, and foreign lands. ... In the Book of the Dead, Seth is called "Lord of the Northern Sky" and is held responsible for storms and cloudy weather. ... Seth was portrayed as a man with the head of undeterminable origin, although some see in it the head of an aardvark.  He had a curved snout, erect square-tipped ears and a long forked tail. He was sometimes entirely in animal form with the body similar to that of a greyhound.  Animals sacred to this god were the dog, the jackal, the gazelle, the donkey, the crocodile, the hippopotamus, and the pig.

Like other Greek gods, he is endowed with not-inconsiderable sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs.
He is a god of boundaries, guardian of graves and patron deity of shepherds.  He is usually depicted as a handsome young man wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the kerykeion.  He is reputedly the only being able to find his way to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again.

Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is
the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the
animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and
guardian deity of horse races.
His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear
with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and
shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of
earthquakes as well.  Physically, he is shown as a strong and
powerful ruler, every inch a king.

the Street of the Gods and was now back again, ready for
oblivion.  He is not to be confused with Issek the Armless,
Issek of the Burnt Legs, Flayed Issek, or any other of the

fact that the manner of his death -- racking -- was not
