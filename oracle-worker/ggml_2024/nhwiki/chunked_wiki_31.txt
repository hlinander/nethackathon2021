== Losing your armor ==

Since armor is neccessary for survival, and it takes lot of efforts to obtain a good armor, losing it can be very painful. There are several ways you can lose your armor.

=== Changing shape ===

If you change shape through any means into any form that is Large or bigger (Medium or bigger for non-[[humanoid]] forms), a [[winged gargoyle]] or [[marilith]] (wings and extra arms don't fit), your torso armor ([[body armor]], a [[shirt]] and/or a [[cloak]]) will burst apart, destroying the items.

As an exception, if you polymorph into a dragon while wearing dragon scale mail (or dragon scales) of the same color, it will not burst apart.  Instead, it will merge into your scales. When you return to your original form, you will get it back. If enchanced above +3, it may evaporate when you return to your original form. Your shirt and cloak will tear as usual. See [[Dragon scale mail#Polymorph|Dragon scale mail §&nbsp;Polymorph]] for more information.

If you polymorph into a [[whirly]] monster (all v's and [[air elemental]]), however, your torso armor will not tear, since all whirly monsters also [[Unsolid|lack a solid form]].

==== Polymorphing and prevention ====

While potions and wands of polymorph can be dealt with through the usual methods of testing (e.g. engraving and dipping, avoiding quaffing randomly, etc.), polymorph traps are an obstacle to any player since they may step on one unexpectedly. In addition to the usual means of checking and avoiding traps, polymorph traps can be dealt with in the following manner:
* [[Gray dragon scale mail]], [[cloak of magic resistance]], [[Magicbane]], and [[Magic_resistance#Obtaining|some quest artifacts]] provide magic resistance, which protects you from polymorph traps.
* Wearing an [[amulet of unchanging]] prevents you from changing your current form by polymorph or other means, and also protects you from being slimed.
* Wearing a [[ring of polymorph control]] while stepping on a polymorph trap will prompt you to enter what monster you want to polymorph into. Enter the name of a monster who you know will not compromise body armor; [[gargoyle]]s (not [[winged gargoyle]]) are a good choice. The [[Polymorph control#Good choices for self polymorph|usual polyself tips]] are also applicable.
* As mentioned above, stepping on a polymorph trap while wearing dragon scale mail or dragon scales will polymorph the player into a same-color dragon, though the scales may evaporate upon reverting to normal form if they were enchanted; while they can be restored to mail using a [[scroll of enchant armor]], this is usually less desirable overall since the player might not have a chance to remove their other body armor before hand.

==== Lycanthropy ====

Being bitten by a [[werecreature]] will give the player lycanthropy, which causes involuntary shapeshifting into that creature's form; if bitten by a werewolf, the transformation into a wolf will destroy body armor. This cannot be prevented with magic resistance.

The [[lycanthropy]] page goes into more detail for dealing with its adverse effects. Generally, players should pay attention while fighting a werewolf to see if it bites them, and take the appropriate measures available (e.g. prayer, [[wolfsbane]], [[holy water]], etc.)

[[Polymorph control]] and [[amulet of unchanging]] prevent the transformation as in the previous section.

=== Scrolls of destroy armor ===

Reading unidentified scrolls is generally a [[bad idea]], since you may read a [[scroll of destroy armor]] and possibly lose a vital piece of protection as a result. Price identification can partly mitigate this by at least helping a player recognize the scroll's price range and avoiding it. If a player is determined to test a random scroll for some reason, they can simply remove any armor except for common "throwaway" items such as an orcish helm before reading it. Shirt and body armor can be protected by a "throwaway" cloak, since the scroll does not destroy other torso armor if the player is wearing a cloak.

=== Scrolls of enchant armor ===

The [[scroll of enchant armor]] has the potential to [[Scroll of enchant armor#Vaporization|vaporize]] a piece of armor being worn if it is enchanted above +3; elven armor may safely be enchanted at +5 or lower, and this also applies to [[cornuthaum]]s if the player is a wizard.

=== Monster spells ===

Monsters in lower levels of the dungeon may cast the [[Destroy armor (monster spell)|destroy armor]] spell on the player, with the same effect as the scroll. This includes [[lich]]es and [[golden naga]]s, who may be the first such examples a player encounters. There are several ways to prevent this:
* Magic resistance (from [[gray dragon scale mail]], [[cloak of magic resistance]], and [[Magic_resistance#Obtaining|some quest artifacts]]) completely nullifies the spell effects.
* [[Cancellation|Cancelling]] the offender will prevent them from casting any spells.
* Liches are high on the list of [[genocide]] candidates, and thus are often removed as a threat as soon as possible.
* If a monster is confused, the spell has lower chances to succeed (see [[monster spell]] for more information).
* As with scrolls of destroy armor, wearing a "spare" cloak (such as a dwarvish cloak for non-dwarven characters) over your armor can protect it by giving the spell something else to target, though this is not as viable if the player cannot dispose of the monster quickly.

=== Disintegration ===

[[Black dragons]] can fire blasts of [[disintegration]], as can the [[Chromatic Dragon]], and a sufficiently angered [[god]] will attempt to smite a player with a [[wide-angle disintegration beam]] if the initial lightning bolt they use fails. Disintegration blasts from dragons will destroy worn shields, worn body armor including cloaks, and the player themselves (along with shirts and cloaks) in order of priority.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3593|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3450|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

[[Reflection]] and [[disintegration resistance]] can protect your shield, cloak, body armor and shirt from the former; worn pieces of armor that provides either extrinsically will be protected from both and, in the case of body armor or cloaks, protects [[shirts]] worn under them. Disintegration resistance can be acquired as an intrinsic by eating the corpse of a black dragon, and may also be granted with a ~17% by eating the corpse of the Chromatic Dragon for cavemen (though note that her corpse is poisonous). Black dragon scales or scale mail can provide extrinsic disintegration resistance.

For detailed advice on dealing with an angry god and how to avoid angering one in the first place, see the article section on [[Anger#smite|smiting]].

==Variants==

===UnNetHack===

[[UnNetHack]] adds [[UnNetHack#New objects|new pieces of armor]]:
* [[Striped shirt]] - starting armor for the [[Convict]] role, cursed. Shopkeepers will refuse to serve a player wearing this shirt, unless it is covered by other armor (as with the other [[shirt]]s).
* [[Tin foil hat]] - made of [[metal]], protects against a [[mind flayer]]'s psychic blast attack, but nullifies any form of [[telepathy]].
* [[Chromatic dragon scale mail]] - dropped by rare [[chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)|chromatic dragon]]s, confers the extrinsic resistances of every color of dragon scale mail, including [[reflection]] and [[Petrification|stone resistance]], but not [[magic resistance]].

The names, colors, and breath types of dragons other than chromatic dragons are randomized. Scales from "[[glowing dragon]]s" act as a [[light source]], in addition to whatever resistance they confer.

[[Racial equipment|Racial armor]] tracking is implemented. The number of pieces of equipment worn that are associated with your starting [[race]] is tracked as a [[conduct]]. Also, every worn piece of racial armor gives an extra point of [[AC]].

===SporkHack===
[[SporkHack]] adds [[Category:SporkHack items|several new items]], including:
* [[tin foil hat]]

===FIQHack===

Armor generally weighs more in [[FIQHack]] than in vanilla.  However, wearing a piece of armor decreases its weight by half.

[[Dragon scale mail]] weighs 300 (150 if worn) instead of vanilla's 40.

If your outermost armor is greased, you can squeeze through tight diagonal spaces with twice as much inventory as in vanilla.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another
boy and me.  He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his
mother had made him from her hair.  I, on the other hand, had
a brand new suit of chain mail.  Just before our joust, I asked
him what he'd do if he made the team.  (I was hoping to be more
popular with the ladies.)  He said he would be able to save the
town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20
brothers and sisters.

Well, a sense of compassion came over me.  I insisted we swap
armor.  He was forced to accept, as it would have been an
insult not to do so.

On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected
with our lances.

Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor
class was that day."

One of the most coveted weapons in the game, '''Grayswandir''' is a [[lawful]] [[silver saber]] that can do both [[double damage]] (to all targets, without exception) and [[silver damage]], and prevents [[hallucination]]. Because, like [[Fire and Frost Brand]], it is [[Intelligent artifacts|non-intelligent]], it may be wished for and used even by non-lawfuls who can survive its possible blasting damage (25% chance of 4d4) when it is transferred to or appears in their inventory or is wielded.

==Average damage calculation==

Grayswandir's [[double damage]] applies only to its base d8 damage and its damage due to enchantment, not to its silver damage or any other bonuses. 

The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.
{|class="wikitable"

|| <math>\left (\frac{1+8}{2}+7\right )\times 2+\frac{1+20}{2}=\bold{33.5}</math>
|}

==Generation==

Grayswandir can be randomly generated wherever a silver saber can be generated, but this is exceptionally rare. Only {{frac|40}} of all randomly generated silver sabers will be Grayswandir,{{refsrc|mkobj.c|403|comment=the {{frac|20}} chance is shared with [[Werebane]]}} and there aren't many randomly generated silver sabers. A more reliable way to get it, if lawful, is to offer [[sacrifice]]s to your god. Others can [[wish]] for it or occasionally find it in [[bones]] files.

==Strategy==

Grayswandir has an advantage over [[Fire Brand]], [[Frost Brand]], and [[Mjollnir]] in that it will not destroy items in the inventory of the monster or player being hit. It is also a single-handed weapon, allowing you to wear a shield, or #[[twoweapon]] with a plain silver saber for even more silver damage. Because of this, many players consider Grayswandir the best weapon in the game. It cuts through the undead and demons in [[Gehennom]], but it should be noted that most of the monsters on the [[Elemental Planes]] are not silver haters.

It should be noted that Grayswandir is indisputably the best weapon in the late game, when fully enchanted and at expert. However, artifact weapon selection matters less in the late game than in the early game, as in the late game, hit points, magic defenses, evasion strategies, and armor class are more valuable than weapon damage. For this reason, other weapons which are more readily available and do more damage when at basic skill and unenchanted (such as Mjollnir) should also be considered as early game powerhouses. In the early game, there are few silver haters, and the &times;2 bonus is unremarkable without scrolls of enchant weapon. If those are in short supply, other options should be considered if given the choice.

==Hallucination resistance==

Wielding Grayswandir protects you from [[hallucination]]. However, it does not actually prevent you from being afflicted with the status, but merely suppresses its effect. If you were attacked by hallucination while wielding Grayswandir, unwielding it will cause you to start hallucinating as normal.

If hallucination wears off while you are wielding Grayswandir, you will receive the message "Your vision seems to flatten for a moment but is normal now."

==Origin==

Grayswandir is a reference to the ''[[Wikipedia:Chronicles of Amber|Chronicles of Amber]]'' book series. Corwin, the protagonist, has a silver sword called Grayswandir. From Wikipedia:

:Grayswandir is Corwin's sword, also known as the Night Blade; its twin is Brand's Werewindle, the Day Sword. Both Grayswandir and Werewindle are inscribed with portions of the Pattern of Amber; this makes them particularly effective against creatures of Chaos.

==Variants==

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Grayswandir can be [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forged]] together with [[Dragonbane]] to create [[EvilHack#Forged Artifacts|The Gauntlets of Purity]], an artifact pair of silver [[gauntlets of power]].

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Why had I been wearing Grayswandir?  Would another weapon have affected a Logrus-ghost as strongly?  Had it really been my father, then, who had brought me here?  And had he felt I might need the extra edge his weapon could provide?  I wanted to think so, to believe that he had been more than a Pattern-ghost.

'''Fire Brand''' and '''Frost Brand''' are two very similar [[artifact]]s. They are both unaligned [[long sword]]s that give [[double damage]] and +''1d5'' to-hit against [[monster]]s not resistant to fire or cold respectively. When the bonus is applied, Frost Brand gives the message "The ice-cold blade freezes the <monster>!" and Fire Brand gives "The fiery blade burns the <monster>!"

Fire Brand confers [[fire resistance]] when wielded, and Frost Brand confers [[cold resistance]] when wielded. 

== Strategy ==

Frost Brand is vastly more popular than Fire Brand, because many monsters in [[Gehennom]] are fire-resistant. However, most of the [[Astral Plane]]'s monsters are cold-resistant and not fire-resistant. Both can destroy [[potion]]s carried by their target; Fire Brand can also destroy [[scroll]]s and [[spellbook]]s. Some players dislike using them for this reason, but they are likely to kill their targets before the monster can use its item or the item is destroyed.

Frost and Fire Brand do slightly more damage than [[Grayswandir]] against large monsters who are neither resistant nor silver-hating. For that reason, they make excellent weapons once you have the resources to enchant them, and Frost Brand is probably your best weapon choice for Gehennom if you have it (unless you also have Grayswandir).

==Average damage calculation==

The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s. The same calculations apply to Frost Brand with respect to cold-resistant monsters.

In [[xNetHack]], Fire Brand and Frost Brand are [[short sword]]s instead of long swords, reducing their damage.

Additionally, Fire Brand instantly kills flammable [[golem]]s and [[green slime]]s.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Fire and Frost brand are short swords instead of long swords, and are always made of steel. Additionally, they can be [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forged]] together to create [[EvilHack#Forged Artifacts|The Sword of Annihilation]], an artifact long sword.

}}

'''Sunsword''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[lawful]], and its [[base item]] is a [[long sword]].

==Generation==
Sunsword can be received as a [[sacrifice gift]] by lawful characters. [[Angel]]s and [[Aleax]]es have a 5% chance of their [[Monster starting inventory|normal starting]] [[erodeproof]] [[long sword]] being Sunsword; [[Archons]] generated normally have a 50% chance of generating with either Sunsword or [[Demonbane]], with a rustproof long sword replacing either [[artifact]] if it was already generated.

==Description==
Sunsword has +''1d5'' to hit and does [[double damage]] against [[undead]], and prevents [[blindness|blinding]] from lights. It also acts as a [[light]] source when wielded, with a radius centered around the wielder based on its [[beatitude]]: 3 if blessed, 2 if uncursed, and 1 if cursed. It will unlight when unwielded.{{refsrc|src/light.c|676|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} The light repels [[gremlin]]s and deals ''+1d8'' damage to them when lit.{{refsrc|src/weapon.c|328|nethack=3.6.2}}

==Strategy==
Sunsword's use as a light source is generally considered more important than its damage bonus, though it hits a far wider range of monsters than most [[Bane]]-style artifacts. Sunsword is still a viable option by virtue of its base item, and proves reasonable at worst in the absence of a better artifact. It can also be a good means of training the skill for classes that have it, or else can unrestrict it via [[sacrifice gift]].

Players attempting the genocideless conduct may find it useful against [[lich]]es. The double damage versus undead may be of particular interest to [[Priests]], who face many undead on their quest, as well as anyone passing through the [[Valley of the Dead]] and into [[Gehennom]].

===As a light source=== 
Blessed{{lightradius|r=3|}} Uncursed{{lightradius|r=2}} Cursed{{lightradius|r=1}}
{{yellow|x}} represents the squares lit by Sunsword.

==History==
In [[3.4.3]] and previous versions, as well as some variants based on them, the light range does not depend on [[BUC]], and always has a radius of 2. The additional effects on gremlins were added in [[3.6.2]].

==Messages==
{{message|Sunsword begins to shine [dimly/brightly/brilliantly]!|You wielded Sunsword, and it is now giving off light.}}
{{message|Sunsword stops shining.|You unwielded Sunsword.}}
{{message|Sunsword shines [brighter/less brightly].|The BUC status of Sunsword changed while being wielded.}}

==Variants==
===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Sunsword additionally deals double damage to demons, [[petrification|petrifies]] [[troll]]s and gremlins, and may also [[blind]] struck enemies. It now uses (and trains) the higher skill of [[short sword]]s and long swords, which makes it effective even for roles that cannot use long swords effectively.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], Sunsword blocks blindness, much like [[The Eyes of the Overworld]]. Its double damage is replaced by a +1d20 damage bonus.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Sunsword is a much better option for lawfuls: It is easier to obtain due to lawfuls receiving {{mcsl|A}} minions as sacrifice gifts, who are likely to be generated carrying it, and their chances to be gifted are not affected by previous gifts as with artifacts. On top of this, the minion can be easily and safely disarmed with a [[bullwhip]]. Furthermore, undead are far more dangerous in SLASH'EM with the additon of spellcasting [[Vampire mage (SLASH'EM)|vampire]] and [[ghoul mage]]s, fast and hard-hitting [[gug]]s, regenerating troll [[mummies]], and other new undead monsters that make Sunsword's comparatively limited range of double damage much more useful than in vanilla NetHack.

Note that if you [[twoweapon]] this sword, it will ''not'' provide light if wielded in your off-hand.

SLASH'EM also adds the [[Holy Spear of Light]], which functions similarly, but also has the ability to permanently illuminate an area around the player, damaging undead in the process.

===SpliceHack===
In SpliceHack, Sunsword is made of crystal. It is a random one-handed sword, which might be a long sword.

'''Magic resistance''' is an [[Property|extrinsic property]] which protects against many annoying magical attacks and effects. It is part of most [[ascension kit]]s, and is generally considered a high priority to obtain as soon as possible.

== Effect ==
Magic resistance protects against:
* Death magic from external sources:
** [[instadeath]] effect of [[Riders#Death|Death]]'s [[Touch_of_death|touch attacks]]
** zapped [[wand of death]] and {{spell of|finger of death}}
** the [[touch of death]] [[monster spell]]
* Polymorph magic from external sources:
** vapors from a [[potion of polymorph]]
** [[polymorph traps]]
* Damage from pure magic:
** [[magic missile]] attacks of [[Angel]]s, [[gray dragon]]s, [[Yeenoghu]], the [[Chromatic Dragon]], and the [[Oracle]]
** the magic explosion from [[breaking wands|breaking]] any wand, but not necessarily the wand specific special effect
** zapped or broken wands of {{of|wand|striking|or=1|magic missile}}
** zapped spells of {{spell of|force bolt}} or {{spell of|magic missile}}
** damage from exploding [[spellbook]]s
* [[Teleportation trap|Teleport]] and [[level teleport trap|level teleport]] traps
* [[Energy]] drain from [[anti-magic field]]s; they cause damage instead
* Being [[scare]]d by [[Magicbane]], and the chance of its other effects is reduced
* The [[Destroy armor (monster spell)|destroy armor]], [[drain strength]], and [[Confuse (monster spell)|confuse]] [[monster spell]]s
* The effect of the [[Paralyze (monster spell)|paralyze]] and [[Stun (monster spell)|stun]] [[monster spell]]s is reduced to one turn
* Damage from the [[psi bolt]] and [[open wounds]] [[monster spell]]s is halved
* Damage from [[artifact blast]]s is halved
* The number of items cursed by [[curse items]] from any source is halved

Magic resistance does '''not''' protect against:
* [[Magic trap]]s
* Death magic that you pointed at yourself:
** zapped [[wand of death]] or {{spell of|finger of death}} aimed at yourself
* [[Polymorph]] magic that you directed at yourself:
** zapped [[wand of polymorph|wand]] or [[spellbook of polymorph|spell]] of polymorph aimed at yourself
** broken [[wand of polymorph]]
** quaffed [[potion of polymorph]]
** eating a [[chameleon]] corpse

== Obtaining ==

'''Magic resistance''' is granted by wielding [[Magicbane]], wearing a [[cloak of magic resistance]], [[gray dragon scales]], or [[gray dragon scale mail]], polymorphing into a [[gray dragon|(baby) gray dragon]], or carrying, wearing or wielding certain [[Quest artifact]]s.

== Monsters ==
In addition to [[Magic resistance (monster)|monster-type magic resistance]], some monsters have player-style magic resistance: those with a [[magic missile]] attack or a random breath weapon, plus [[baby gray dragon]]s.{{reffunc|mondata.c|resists_magm}} In vanilla, this means [[Angel]]s, [[Yeenoghu]], [[gray dragon]]s, the [[Oracle]], and the [[Chromatic Dragon]]. Anyone coding new monsters should be aware of this somewhat counter-intuitive means of granting intrinsic magic resistance to monsters.

Monsters gain player-style resistance from a worn [[cloak of magic resistance]], gray dragon scales or scale mail, or from wielding a co-aligned artifact: neutral [[Magicbane]], lawful [[Sceptre of Might]]. Carrying quest artifacts also works (especially important in the case of your quest nemesis and the [[Wizard of Yendor]]), but tame monsters will not keep them unless worn or wielded.

This provides most of the same protections to monsters as it does to the player, e.g. death rays, magic missiles and involuntary polymorphs. It does not make them resist taming or [[conflict]], as monster-style magic resistance would, nor against [[level teleporter]] traps, as player magic resistance does.

== Strategy ==
Magic resistance and [[reflection]] are the number one properties to get, closely followed by [[magic cancellation]]. Generally, you should [[wish]] to get them or [[Dragon scale mail#Acquiring scales and scale mail|make gray dragon scale mail]] if you cannot get them otherwise, ideally before the [[Castle]].

Relying only on a quest artifact for magic resistance is dangerous in the endgame, because the [[Wizard of Yendor]] can [[Covetous|steal it from you]] and become magic resistant himself. He will then absorb any death rays or magic missiles unharmed, while you are left quite vulnerable to his [[touch of death]]. As of Nethack 3.6.1, the Wizard can steal any quest artifact, not just your own.

Player-style magic resistance is good in a pet, as death rays and polymorph traps lose their threat. If you want to make your pet magic resistant, gray dragon scale mail (or the cloak) are usually best. If you go the artifact weapon route, make sure your pet is carrying as few objects as possible and disarm it with a [[bullwhip]] beforehand to keep it from wielding any different artifact it may encounter. Unfortunately, the most useful pet, an [[Archon]], cannot be made magic resistant&mdash;pets will not wield quest artifacts (ruling out the Sceptre of Might) or cross-aligned artifacts (preventing Magicbane from working). Thus, only intelligent neutral pets can be made magic-resistant with an artifact weapon.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
New monsters with player-style magic resistance are [[Golem (SLASH'EM)|diamond and crystal golems]] and adult [[Shimmering dragon (SLASH'EM)|shimmering dragons]]. In addition, there are many more useful pets capable of wearing body armor, including [[astral deva]]s and [[Vampire mage (SLASH'EM)|vampire mages]].

Also, magic resistance is granted by carrying [[the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa]], [[the Stake of Van Helsing]], or [[the Crown of Saint Edward]]. The Crown will always be lawful, and the Stake is lawful if wished for or if obtained by a lawful Undead Slayer, so they can both be used to give a pet [[Solar]] magic resistance.

&&%s&& %s Sleep resistance {141496 2021-07-04T15:10:38Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''Sleep resistance''' is a [[property]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It prevents you from being put to [[sleep]] by [[wand of sleep|wands of sleep]], [[potion of sleeping|potions of sleeping]], sleeping gas [[trap]]s, [[orange dragon]]s' breath attacks, wearing an [[amulet of restful sleep]], or reading a dull [[spellbook]].

==Sources==
The property can be obtained intrinsically through the following methods:

* Playing a [[Monk]]
* Playing an [[Elf (starting race)|elf]] of any role and reaching level 4
* Being polymorphed into a naturally sleep-resistant monster
* Being [[crowned]]
* Eating a [[corpse]] or [[tin]] of any of the following monsters:

Obtaining sleep resistance is generally not difficult, as elves are quite common in the [[Dungeons of Doom]] and can be safely eaten by anyone except player elves (who already gain the intrinsic by level-up). 

==Messages==
The following messages are associated with sleep resistance:

{{message|You feel wide awake.|You gained sleep resistance by eating a corpse or tin.}}
{{message|You feel awake!|You gained sleep resistance by reaching level 4 as an elf.}}
{{message|You feel tired!|You lost sleep resistance through level drain.}}
{{message|You yawn.<br>You don't feel sleepy.|You were hit by a sleep-inducing attack or item, but you have sleep resistance.}}

'''Dragon scale mail''' (commonly abbreviated '''DSM''') is the strongest single piece of [[body armor]] available. Its base [[AC]] reduction is 9, it [[weight|weighs]] only 40, provides a useful [[extrinsic]], is inherently [[erosion|erodeproof]], and doesn't hinder [[spellcasting]]. It does not however provide any [[magic cancellation]], and should hence be complemented by a high [[MC]] cloak.

'''Dragon scales''' are [[body armor]] that might be dropped by a [[dragon]]. They have a base [[AC]] reduction of only 3, but are otherwise identical to the dragon scale mail of the same color. They can be [[#Making dragon scale mail from scales|converted]] into dragon scale mail.

The most coveted varieties are [[silver dragon scale mail]] (SDSM) for [[reflection]] and [[gray dragon scale mail]] (GDSM) for [[magic resistance]].

==Effects==

===Colors===
The following table shows the extrinsic abilities provided by each color of dragon scales or dragon scale mail:

{| class="prettytable" style="border:none; margin:0; padding:0;"
!Color !! Extrinsic
|-
|[[Blue dragon scale mail|Blue]]||[[shock resistance]]
|-
|[[Black dragon scale mail|Black]]||[[disintegration resistance]]
|-
|[[Gray dragon scale mail|Gray]]||[[magic resistance]]
|-
|[[Green dragon scale mail|Green]]||[[poison resistance]]

|-
|[[Silver dragon scale mail|Silver]]||[[reflection]]
|-
|[[White dragon scale mail|White]]||[[cold resistance]]
|-
|[[Yellow dragon scale mail|Yellow]]||[[acid resistance]]
|}

Black, gray, and silver dragon scale mail have a base price of 1200 zm, and their scales are 700 zm. Other varieties are 900 zm for the mail and 500 zm for the scales. Gray, silver, and yellow dragon scales are the only ones whose resistances cannot can be obtained as [[intrinsic]]s.

===Polymorph===
Uncontrolled [[polymorph]]ing while wearing dragon scales or dragon scale mail turns you into a dragon of the same color. This, and purposeful polymorph into a dragon of the same color, will revert your scale mail back to its scale form{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|500|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}, but leave its enchantment unchanged. If the dragon scales are enchanted above +3, it is possible that they will evaporate while attempting to return them to dragon scale mail. While polymorphed, the scales will show up as "(embedded in your skin)" and will not function as armor: the base AC and enchantment of the scales will not lower your polymorphed AC, and they cannot be targeted by a [[scroll of enchant armor]]. Your [[shirt]] and [[cloak]] will tear as normal. If you polymorph again while in dragon form, there is a chance that you will turn into a different large monster, destroying your armor in the process.

Dragon scale mail is considered to be [[magical item|magical]] for purposes of [[polypiling|object polymorph]], whereas dragon scales are not.

Since scales and mail are never generated randomly, they cannot be obtained by polypiling.

==Acquiring scales and scale mail==

There are two main ways to acquire dragon scale mail: either [[wish]] for it directly, or obtain dragon scales and then upgrade them to scale mail. When wishing, make sure of your spelling and wording, or you may end up with a [[scroll of mail]].

There are two other ways to obtain DSM. The first is to find it in a [[bones]] pile, which is obviously unreliable. The other option is to kill one of the [[player monster]]s on the [[Astral Plane]], who have a chance of wearing dragon scale mail. This method is almost completely useless, since any adventurer reaching the Astral Plane will probably have DSM already.

===Making dragon scale mail from scales===
Dragon scale mail can be easily made from dragon scales:
# [[wear]] only the dragon scales you wish to convert
# [[read]] a non-cursed [[scroll of enchant armor]]

If the scroll is blessed, the mail gains 1 point of enchantment and becomes blessed. Beware; if the scales are already above +3, reading a scroll of enchant armor, even in an attempt to upgrade them to mail, may vaporize them as with most other armor.

===Acquiring dragon scales===
Dragon scale mail is simple to acquire: kill dragons of the color you want until one drops scales, and make mail out of them as [[#Making Dragon Scale Mail|described above]].

The chance of a dragon dropping scales is 1/3, but only 1/20 if the dragon was [[revive]]d.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|255|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

Energy sources such as [[magic trap]]s and [[The Mitre of Holiness]] can make [[Spellbook of turn undead|Turn Undead]] a viable strategy for forcing one dragon to drop scales.

Here are some methods of generating dragons:
# [[Polymorph]] [[pet]]s on a [[polymorph trap]] until one becomes the desired dragon, then leave it behind for a while to go [[tameness|wild]] (or just kill it and make up for the [[Luck#Ways_to_change_your_Luck|luck loss]]).
# [[Reverse genocide]] dragons.
# Allow a monster of the appropriate [[Alignment#Monster_alignment|alignment]] to [[summon nasties]] until the desired dragon is created (note that this can never produce Blue, Gray, or White). Be prepared to deal with whatever else is summoned!
# Polymorph into a female dragon of the desired variety, lay some eggs (#[[sit]] command), let them hatch and slowly grow up into adult pet dragons. Killing them with a monster's passive attack or a trap avoids penalties.
# Seek out the dragons found in the [[Castle]], in [[Fort Ludios]], and in some [[quest]] levels.
# Confused [[loot]] [[throne]]s to create [[Special_room#Throne_rooms|Throne Room]] monsters ([[Farming#Throne_farming|farmable]] prior to [[3.6.0]]).

If you want to reverse-genocide dragons to kill, but aren't strong enough to beat them in normal combat, you can force them to engage you in a "cage match" where they can't fight back.

Dig a 3x3 square in the rock behind a [[closet]], or use a [[boulder]] to block the entrance. Stand on a [[scroll of scare monster]] ([[Elbereth]] will fade immediately if you attack, but a permanent engraving is an acceptable alternative if you can rely on [[pet]]s to kill the dragons for you). The scroll will prevent the dragons from attacking you in melee, but they also won't use their breath weapons while in melee range. Beware of digging monsters breaking your setup.

If you manage to get to the [[castle]] without dragon scale mail, the room with the [[wand of wishing]] in a [[chest]] includes a guaranteed scroll of scare monster on the floor. It is cursed, so attempting to pick it up will destroy it. There are two positions in the room where a dragon can breathe at you, which you can block off with boulders generated by a [[scroll of earth]] from [[Sokoban]]. The walls are undiggable, negating the threat of disruption.

The [[Sokoban]] scroll of scare monster can also be used, although you'll have to move it out of the closet by digging a [[hole]] below it and letting it fall through. Hopefully it lands somewhere a [[boulder fort]] can be arranged (in place of walls); if not, you can move the scroll into a more suitable position by [[kick]]ing it (it will be stopped by either a wall or a monster) or, if it gets stuck, digging a hole once more (except on the lowest level).

==Strategy==

===Gray or silver?===
{{main|GDSM versus SDSM}}
<!-- Please don't add too much info here; that's what the GDSM versus SDSM page is for. -->

Gray and silver are widely considered the two best types of dragon scale mail, but players disagree as to which is more useful in particular circumstances. Gray provides [[magic resistance]] which protects against monster spells and polytraps; silver provides [[reflection]] which protects against wands and breath attacks. Since both are extremely useful, it's best to find a source of magic resistance or reflection and then get the dragon scale mail that grants the other intrinsic.

===Other colors===
In general, one will always want GDSM or SDSM.  However, there are some corner cases where one might use another color:
*[[Wishless]] ascensions: Of course, one can obtain DSM without wishing via reverse genocide.  However, some unlucky characters may find neither the scroll nor enough magic markers to write one.  In this case, it is worth enchanting the first dragon scales found, simply for the AC benefit and weight reduction.
*[[Foodless]] ascensions: While players attempting a foodless ascension can get most resistances through [[crowning]], this may be undesirable (or even impossible for foodless [[atheist]]s). The extra extrinsic may thus be worthwhile, particularly if the player already has MR and reflection from other sources. One advantage of gaining extrinsics from DSM over rings is that you have to identify the rings first. The three most desirable colors are:
:* Red dragon scale mail, to protect against the [[fire trap]]s in [[Gehennom]], can be superseded by the [[ring of fire resistance|ring]].
:* Green dragon scale mail, to protect against spiked pits, poisoned missiles, and poison melee attacks, can be supplanted by an [[alchemy smock]], by the eponymous amulet or ring, and for some roles by leveling up.
:*[[Sleep resistance]], from orange dragon scale mail, protects against traps, wands, and thrown potions. It is granted to elves at level 4, but otherwise cannot be entirely superseded by a [[ring of free action]], making that DSM also useful.
*If you really hate acid attacks: Short of self-[[polymorph]] or the MC 1 [[alchemy smock]], yellow dragon scale mail is the only way to obtain acid resistance.  Acid attacks are rarely threatening, however.

==Variants==

===SLASH'EM===
Getting dragon scale mail is a bit different in SLASH'EM. Baby dragons take much longer to grow up, and it is not feasible anymore to polymorph pets into dragons for their death drop (due to polymorph working like it does for player characters). However, there are many dragons in the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Wyrm Caves|Wyrm Caves]], and there are the guaranteed gray dragon scales in the [[Lawful Quest]] and the gray dragon scale mail worn by [[Black market (SLASH'EM)#One-eyed Sam|One-eyed Sam]]. The last two may be somewhat difficult to liberate from their previous owners, and the law quest one is generated cursed -9.

Some of the [[gnoll]]s can be generated with dragon scale mail: gnoll warriors may be generated with orange dragon scale mail, chieftains may get blue dragon scale mail, and shamans may get either red or silver dragon scale mail.

SLASH'EM's used armor dealers can sometimes [[shopkeeper services|enchant armor for you]].  Using this service on dragon scales will turn them into dragon scale mail, providing a way for [[illiterate]] characters to obtain dragon scale mail without violating conduct.  However, the player is far from guaranteed to find a shopkeeper who offers the appropriate service: only 25% of armor dealers will offer it.

====New colors in SLASH'EM====
{| class="prettytable" style="border:none; margin:0; padding:0;"
!Color !! Extrinsic
|-
|[[Shimmering dragon scale mail|Shimmering]]||[[displacement]]
|-
|[[Deep dragon scale mail|Deep]]||[[level-drain resistance]]
|}

While still less useful than GDSM and SDSM, these two new dragon scale mails are still worth using for some players.  Drain resistance is a lot more important in SLASH'EM, given the abundance of [[wand of draining|wands of draining]] and the breath of [[deep dragon]]s in its later game; a player who has magic resistance and reflection from other sources may well consider deep dragon scale mail as an option.  Meanwhile, shimmering dragon scale mail provides a way for players to get displacement and [[MC]] 3 at the same time without sacrificing their cloak slot. Finally, due to the presence of [[shoggoth]]s and [[giant shoggoth]]s with their high speed and massive acid damage, yellow dragon scale mail is also a viable option.

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], all colors of DSM save gray and silver have some kind of secondary effect. Spork also adds an additional color, gold, which acts as a permanent light source.

{| class="prettytable" style="border:none; margin:0; padding:0;"
!Color !! Extrinsic !! [[SporkHack]] secondary extrinsic
|-
|[[Blue dragon scale mail|Blue]]||[[shock resistance]]||[[speed]]
|-
|[[Black dragon scale mail|Black]]||[[disintegration resistance]]||passive blinding attack
|-
|[[Gray dragon scale mail|Gray]]||[[magic resistance]]||none
|-
|[[Green dragon scale mail|Green]]||[[poison resistance]]||passive [[poison]] attack
|-
|[[Orange dragon scale mail|Orange]]||[[sleep resistance]]||passive slow attack
|-
|[[Red dragon scale mail|Red]]||[[fire resistance]]||+1d6 to all melee damage
|-
|[[Silver dragon scale mail|Silver]]||[[reflection]]||none
|-
|[[White dragon scale mail|White]]||[[cold resistance]]||freezes water and lava under foot
|-
|[[Yellow dragon scale mail|Yellow]]||[[acid resistance]]||stun and confusion resistance
|}

====New colors in SporkHack====
{| class="prettytable" style="border:none; margin:0; padding:0;"
!Color !! Extrinsic
|-
|[[Gold dragon scale mail|Gold]]||[[light source|radius 2 light]]
|}

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], '''shimmering dragon scales/mail''' is also added. All old DS/DSM have additional properties too.

{| class="prettytable" style="border:none; margin:0; padding:0;"
!Color !! Extrinsic !! [[dNetHack]] additional extrinsics
|-
|[[Blue dragon scale mail|Blue]]||[[shock resistance]]||[[very fast|very fast speed]]
|-
|[[Black dragon scale mail|Black]]||[[disintegration resistance]]||[[drain resistance]]
|-
|[[Gray dragon scale mail|Gray]]||[[magic resistance]]||[[half spell damage]]
|-
|[[Green dragon scale mail|Green]]||[[poison resistance]]||[[sickness resistance]]
|-
|[[Orange dragon scale mail|Orange]]||[[sleep resistance]]||[[free action]]
|-
|[[Red dragon scale mail|Red]]||[[fire resistance]]||protects from sliming
|-
|[[Silver dragon scale mail|Silver]]||[[reflection|improved reflection]]*||none
|-
|[[White dragon scale mail|White]]||[[cold resistance]]||[[magical breathing]], [[swimming]], and protects inventory from water damage.
|-
|[[Yellow dragon scale mail|Yellow]]||[[acid resistance]]||[[stoning resistance]]
|-
|[[Shimmering dragon scale mail|Shimmering]]||[[displacement]]||none
|}

In addition, dragon scale shields can now be made. They are made by reading a scroll of enchant armor while confused, and will harden worn dragon scales into a shield.  They grant the same extrinsics that the same color of mail does.  

Also, dNetHack silver dragon scale mail/shields is much more valuable.  Amulets and shields of reflection no longer reflect dragon breath, but SDSM/SDSS do.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], dragon scale mails have AC 5 (down from 9) and dragon scales have AC 1 (down from 3).

The powers of dragons and thus their scales and scale mails is randomized each game:

{|class="prettytable"
! Appearances !! Powers (randomized each game)
|-
| tatzelworm || "[[magic resistance|magic]]"
|-
| amphitere || "[[reflection|reflecting]]"
|-
| draken || "[[fire resistance|fire]]"
|-
| lindworm || "[[cold resistance|ice]]"
|-
| sarkany || "[[sleep resistance|sleep]]"
|-
| sirrush || "[[disintegration resistance|disintegration]]"
|-
| leviathan || "[[shock resistance|electric]]"
|-
| wyvern || "[[poison resistance|poison]]"
|-
| glowing* || "[[stoning|stone]]"**
|-
| guivre || "[[acid resistance|acid]]"
|-
| [[chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)|chromatic]] || all
|}

(*) Dragons described as "glowing" always emit light, and wearing their scales or scale mail grants [[light source|radius 2 light]], like SporkHack.

(**) The dragon with the "stone" power has lava breath, not stoning. However, wearing its scales or scale mail confers stoning resistance.

Before wishing for dragon armor, note the [[Wish#UnNetHack|new rules for wishing in UnNetHack]]. In particular, [[wand of wishing#UnNetHack|wands of wishing]] only have 0-2 charges (plus 1 [[wresting|wrest]]), and only wishes from wands can grant wishes for [[magical item]]s. Dragon scale mails, [[magic marker]]s, [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]] and [[scroll of enchant armor|scrolls of enchant armor]] all count as magical items. However, dragon scales are considered non-magical items and can thus be obtained from any wish source.

Any dragon armor can be wished for by appearance, so wishing for "'''guivre''' scale mail" (from a wand of wishing) or "'''guivre''' scales" will always work.

To wish for dragon armor by its power, the corresponding armor must be [[Identification#Auto-identification|formally identified]] first, e.g. by using a [[scroll of identify]] on dropped dragon scales (the matching scale mail will be identified with it). The name of the power (from the table above) can then be used in the wish, e.g. "'''reflecting''' dragon scale mail".

===FIQHack===

* Dragon scale mail in [[FIQHack]] weighs 300 when carried (150 when worn).
* White dragon scale mail protects your inventory from water damage.
* Shimmering dragon scale mail provides [[displacement]] and [[stun]] resistance.
* Blue dragon scale mail gives 100% resistance against slow monsters.

Colored DSM (all except silver/gray) have new benefits, in addition to the standard ones above:
* Red: [[infravision]], [[warning]], [[see invisible]]
* White: [[automatic searching]], swimming, magical breathing
* Orange: [[free action]]
* Black: [[drain resistance]]
* Blue: [[speed]]
* Green: [[sickness]] resistance
* Yellow: [[stoning]] resistance

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], dragon scales are [[cloak]]s instead of body armor. Dragon scale mail is removed; instead, a set of dragon scales can be fused into a suit of body armor by reading a scroll of enchant armor while wearing the scales over the armor. Scrolls of enchant armor will always target worn dragon scales instead of other worn items. Any body armor infused with dragon scales confers 3 extra AC and the scales' extrinsic. If the armor is already dragon-scaled, fusing another set of scales will replace the previous color.

If the scroll is blessed, the fused armor becomes blessed and has its [[erosion]] repaired (but it is not made erodeproof). If the scroll is cursed, the fused armor becomes cursed and loses a point of [[enchantment]].

If you read a scroll of enchant armor while wearing scales without body armor, you [[polymorph]] into the matching type of dragon. (If you have [[polymorph control]], you choose whether to transform.) If you read it while confused and wearing both scales and body armor, the scales fuse into the armor, and then you polymorph into a dragon.

{{encyclopedia|
Stephen had argued, and the expert armorer had grudgingly
admitted, that dragonscale shield or armor, provided it proved
feasible to make at all, ought to offer some real, practical
advantages over any metal breastplate or shield -- gram for

tougher and more protective than any human smiths could
make of steel.

{{otheruses||the material|gemstone}}
In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''gems''' are simple and typically [[weight|lightweight]] items found in the [[dungeon]]. They come in three varieties: valuable gems, '''worthless pieces of glass''' which look similar, and gray stones. Another type of item that uses the same glyph is the [[rock]], which is handled differently.

Valuable identified gems may be sold for relatively large amounts of [[money]] at most general [[store]]s, which makes them valuable as a compact form of money. However, shopkeepers will always buy unidentified gems as if they are worthless glass, and will always sell unidentified gems as if they are valuable, possibly subject to a further 33% surcharge for being unidentified. Valuable gems may also be [[throw]]n to a co-aligned [[unicorn]] to get a large [[Luck]] increase. Throwing any valuable or worthless gem to a unicorn will [[peaceful|pacify]] them, and will variably raise or lower luck in certain cases. See the [[unicorn]] page for details. Valuable gems also give [[score]], but as score does not normally matter, this is typically of low importance.

Glass and rocks are relatively worthless, though they can be used for [[throw]]ing if you should wish to conserve your other attacks. Additionally, they can occasionally be polymorphed into more valuable gems if included in a [[polypiling|polypile]], though it's not worth wasting a wand charge on them. Rocks can also be changed in to [[meatball]]s, useful for taming and for sale in shops.

Despite the name, a worthless piece of ''&lt;color&gt;'' glass will not shatter like other glass items if [[throw]]n against a [[wall]] or dropped while [[levitation|levitating]]. You can fire them from [[sling]]s as a lighter version of [[rock]]s; like [[rock]]s, they can be [[multishot]]. If they are used as ammo however, both worthless pieces of glass and precious gems may disappear (like [[arrow]]s).

==Tables of gems==

===By value===
Some gems' appearances can change. In these cases all the options are listed. The actual appearance is randomly chosen from the options at the beginning of each new game, and is consistent throughout that game (if one fluorite is white, all fluorites in that game will be white). The hardness of a gem can be tested by [[Engrave|#engraving]] with it; if the gem is hard, the game will prompt "What do you want to engrave?"; if it is soft, "What do you want to write in the dust?"
