The '''scramper''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]]. It is slightly more dangerous than the [[rothe]]. The scramper shares the [[xan]]'s leg scratching attack. The scramper corpse is poisonous.

Scrampers appear in packs. Scrampers, like rothes, can cause a quick [[YASD]] if they attack together. (A group of 3 or 4 scrampers might even kill a fully-healed [[player]] in one turn.) Handle scrampers like rothes, with the same tactics.

Retreat into a [[corridor]], to fight one against one. Let your [[pet (SLASH'EM)|pets]] help. Because scrampers are as slow as rothes, you can also do [[hit and run]], make [[ranged attack]]s, or just run away. Engraving [[Elbereth]] can scare scrampers away from you.

The '''mangler''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is similar in concept to a [[rothe]], but much stronger.

==Strategy==

Like rothes, these may appear in small groups and are somewhat slow.  They can do a surprisingly large amount of damage, however.  Their tendency to appear in groups can make it dangerous to fight them, as they can survive long enough for the other members of the pack to surround you, which can be deadly.  One should try to lure them off one by one, or used [[ranged weapon]]s.

The '''giant scorpion''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]]. As the name implies, it is a far stronger version of a [[scorpion]]; similar to a [[winged gargoyle]], however, scorpions can not [[grow up]] into giant scorpions, and laying an egg while polymorphed into a giant scorpion will only produce another giant scorpion.

==Strategy==
These monsters are a major threat: they possess good speed, many hit points, and can inflict a large and steady stream of damage.  One should be particularly careful if one lacks [[poison resistance]], but even with it they remain formidable foes. [[Elbereth]], powerful pets and/or [[attack wand]]s, and possibly [[escape item]]s are all advised. Be very careful not to mistake them for the regular scorpions with whom they share a glyph: they have three times as much health and hit approximately five times as hard.

The '''carrion crawler''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]]. It is notable for having 6 attacks, each of which can cause paralysis. 
==Strategy==
Not a great threat.  High [[magic cancellation]] renders their attacks mostly ineffective, and they do very little damage.  Try not to fight them when other monsters are around, just in case they manage to paralyze you.  Their paralysis does not last long enough to be terribly dangerous, however.

Their corpses can be eaten for a chance at [[poison resistance]], although they appear somewhat later in the game.

The '''spined devil''' is a [[demon]] added in [[SLASH'EM]]. It is fast, but relatively weak.

==Strategy==
Few players will find these a threat: they are relatively fast, but do incredibly poor damage for a monster that only appears in [[Gehennom]], with their two attacks only doing 10 points of physical base damage at most.

Early [[doppelganger (starting race)|doppelgangers]] may find this a useful polymorph form, however; they can start turning into spined devils with 60% success rate at experience level 3. While lacking any special sort of attacks, the form is fast and [[inediate]], more than sufficient for use in the early game.

The '''nabassu''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is a [[demon|demonic]] [[monster spell|spellcaster]] which can also [[drain life]] through its melee attacks.
==Strategy==
While their somewhat low base level generally prevents them from [[summon nasties|summoning nasties]], nabassus just love to [[curse items|curse your items]].  This, combined with their relatively fast speed and tendency to haste themselves, makes them a high-priority target.  If engaging them in melee, one should be sure to have [[drain resistance]] or good [[magic cancellation]] to protect against their life-draining attack.  Be aware that unlike many other spellcasters, their melee attacks will still do a respectable amount of damage, although it is by no means insurmountable.

'''Nightmare''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]]. She is the [[Lawful Quest]] nemesis, and will leave the [[Key of Law]] when killed and [[Nighthorn]] if killed in a way that would leave a corpse - Nightmare will never leave a corpse, instead simply producing Nighthorn and the message "''All that remains is her horn...''". Like all alignment quest nemeses, Nightmare is covetous and will teleport to your position once awakened. Nighthorn is not strictly a unicorn, and thus will not accept gems nor use her horn to heal herself. As Nighthorn grants reflection, Nightmare herself has [[reflection]] and all beams will reflect off of her horn.

Nightmare is also found in the dNetHack Chaos Quest, with slight changes.  She is now a black (chaotic) unicorn, and will be peaceful to chaotics.  If they want the slightly modified horn, they'll have to take the -5 penalty for killing a coaligned unicorn.  See the [[Nighthorn#dNethack|Nighthorn]] article for more.

{{encyclopedia|<poem>
These giant amoeboid creatures look like nothing more than
puddles of slime, but they both live and move, feeding on
metal or wood as well as the occasional dungeon explorer to
supplement their diet.

But we were not on a station platform.  We were on the track ahead
as the nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed
tightly onward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy
speed and driving before it a spiral, re-thickening cloud of the
pallid abyss vapor.  It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster
than any subway train -- a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic
bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes
forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over the
tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic
penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its
kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.

Both possess a [[Passive attack|passive]] [[poison]]ous spore attack. They are safe to eat, however, and have a good chance of providing [[poison resistance]].

Each time you attack one of these monsters in melee without killing it, there is a {{frac|2|3}} chance that a cloud of poisonous spores will be released. The spores are harmless if you are poison resistant, [[unbreathing]], or being [[Amulet of strangulation|strangled]]. Otherwise, one of three effects will occur: there is a {{frac|4|5}} chance of losing 6&ndash;15 hit points, a {{frac|6}} chance of losing 3&ndash;5 points of [[strength]], and a {{frac|30}} chance of the poison being [[instadeath|deadly]].

Although the source code gives both molds a second passive attack (an acid attack, similar to a [[green mold]]), due to a bug in the source code this attack is never actually used.<ref>See [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/uhitm.c#line3033]], the code breaks out of the loop when it hits a passive attack.</ref>

In SLASH'EM, molds now grow from old corpses. See [[Fungus#SLASH'EM|Fungus&nbsp;§ SLASH'EM]].

Disgusting molds are [[sessile]], meaning they will not move and can only cause damage through their [[passive attack]]s. Despite their [[difficulty]], they can be found growing on corpses as early as level one. Players encountering one should find a way to avoid or resist its passive attack.  Means of doing so include:

*Gaining intrinsic or extrinsic [[poison resistance]]. [[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppelgangers]] might try polymorphing into an undead or demonic monster.
*Using ranged attacks, such as [[spell]]s, [[wand]]s, or [[ranged weapon]]s.
*Letting a pet kill it; unfortunately, a pet needs to have base level 4 or higher to attack disgusting molds (and 5 or higher for black molds). This means that starting pets will usually have to [[grow up]] at least once to attack these. Exceptions are the [[Necromancer]]'s [[ghoul]], the [[Flame Mage]]'s [[hell hound pup]], and the [[Ice Mage]]'s [[winter wolf cub]], all of which start with a high enough level.

If you lack any of the above, simply avoid the mold until you do.  Since molds never move, they can pose a problem if they are blocking the only entrance to a room.  Thus, one should always pick up a [[digging tool]] as early as possible, especially since it is a good idea regardless.

Disgusting mold corpses are safe to eat and have a 33% chance of granting [[poison resistance]].

Black molds are flagged as only being generated in [[Gehennom]], but this is ignored when corpses grow moldy. It is otherwise very similar to the disgusting mold, and the advice for dealing with it is much the same.  Be sure to eat its corpse if you lack [[poison resistance]]; it is safe and has a 40% chance of conferring the intrinsic.

A '''chicken''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].  Feeding it [[vegan]] food may tame it.  Contrary to what one might expect, they cannot lay [[egg]]s, and no eggs will hatch as chickens.

==Strategy==
While not a threat in and of itself, chickens share a glyph with the [[instadeath]]-causing [[chickatrice]].  Players should very careful not to mistake a chickatrice for a chicken, therefore.  Both tend to appear in small groups.

Chickens are hardly worth taming: they have low carrying capacity, are weak in combat and cannot [[growing up|grow up]] into anything better.

The '''amulet of flying''' is a new piece of jewelry introduced in [[SLASH'EM]], [[UnNetHack]] and [[EvilHack]].  It grants the [[flying]] intrinsic, which is similar to levitation but far more useful.
In UnNetHack, this amulet is one of the rewards for solving [[Sokoban]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Amulets of flying have been added. They have the same effect as in UnNetHack.}}

==Effects==
Flight is a property possessed by some monsters, which is superficially similar to levitation but has generally more controlled effects, covered on the page about [[flying]].  Of its effects, the only one which is negative is being unable to reach items in pits.  This is of course easily solved by taking off the amulet on the rare occasions that a valuable item falls into one. Note however that you can descend into holes with the {{kbd|>}} command ("You jump through the trap door."). You don't need to remove it then.

==Strategy==
Flight is superior to levitation in almost all manners.  Basically, it allows the player to not need to worry about terrain much at all, since it allows one to usefully cross and interact with any sort of terrain.  In addition, the amulet cannot be destroyed by an electric eel or removed by an incubus, making flight over water considerably safer than levitation over water with a ring.  The only possible downside is not being able to use Newton's 3rd law for a quick escape in some situations.

This is a valuable item for any player to have on hand, as it removes the need for fountains when diluting potions, and is more convenient than [[water walking boots]].  The multitude of other positive effects means that for a careful player who already has [[drain resistance]], this amulet is well worth considering as an amulet in an ascension kit.  In particular, it removes the need to switch rings to [[levitation|levitate]], which is quite useful in [[SLASH'EM]], given that [[free action]] is somewhat more essential.  [[Drain resistance]] should be given priority, however, although a careful player may find it feasible to quickly switch amulets or wield an artifact that provides the intrinsic.  Some players may still prefer [[amulet of life saving|life saving]], but for those who don't, an amulet of flying may be just the thing.

A '''stick of dynamite''' is a new item introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is essentially a more powerful [[grenade]], but it is never randomly generated.

==Arming==
Arming works similarly to grenades, i.e. the time is dependent on BUC status.  The fuse is longer, though:
*Blessed: 15 turns
*Uncursed: ''d10''+9 turns
*Cursed: ''d15''+1 turns
When armed, it gives off a radius-2 light, similar to a lit [[potion of oil]].  Using a stick of dynamite as a light source is not recommended however.

==Explosion==
A stick of dynamite will explode in a fireball doing 6d6 damage, and will attempt to destroy walls and create pits in a 3x3 square centered on the stick of dynamite. This effect is somewhat similar to a broken [[wand of digging]].

==Strategy==
As these never appear randomly, most players will never see one.  The only way they can appear is via a wish, and they most certainly do not merit one.

'''Nighthorn''' is an [[artifact]] [[unicorn horn]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]], [[SlashTHEM]] and [[dNetHack]]. It is associated with [[Nightmare]] in both games.

==Generation==
In all appearances, Nighthorn cannot be randomly generated or wished for, and will only appear upon killing Nightmare - Nightmare [[corpseless|does not normally leave a corpse]], but will instead drop Nighthorn if killed in a way that would otherwise leave a corpse (i.e., without [[disintegration|disintegrating]] or [[digestion|digesting]] her). The dropped Nighthorn will always be generated [[cursed]] and at +0.

==SLASH'EM==
In SLASH'EM, Nighthorn is [[lawful]] and obtained at the end of the [[Lawful Quest]], where Nightmare resides. It functions the same as a standard unicorn horn, and provides [[reflection]] when wielded.

===Strategy===
Most characters will find little reason to [[apply]] Nighthorn over a regular blessed and enchanted unicorn horn for curing status afflictions. As a weapon, it is a viable option for the mid-game, though non-lawful characters may be dissuaded due to the chance of taking 8d6 [[artifact blast|blasting]] damage; it is still worth considering if they are not restricted in the unicorn horn [[skill]] and other sources of reflection prove scarce.

However, it does no more damage than a regular unicorn horn, making it a weaker weapon in the late game; it will also not resist curses, which is one of the biggest set-backs for any [[two-handed]] weapon, much less a healing item. A source of [[reflection]], such as a [[shield of reflection]], will often be preferable for most characters at the point they can clear the Lawful Quest.

==dNetHack==

In dNetHack, Nighthorn is a chaotic and intelligent unicorn horn, and is obtained the same way. However, Nightmare is a chaotic [[unicorn]] in dNetHack, and will thus be peaceful towards chaotic characters; a chaotic who wants the horn may need to take the &minus;5 penalty to [[Luck]] and alignment for killing a coaligned unicorn, unless they can get a pet to manage it.

dNetHack's Nighthorn always blasts its user when picked up, and will additionally always evade the grasp of lawfuls. Nighthorn acts as a [[luckstone]] when carried, and grants fire resistance while wielded. It grants +1d12 to-hit and does an additional 1d24 of fire damage against non-resistant monsters; hitting a monster also causes a fiery explosion centered on that target. Additionally, if you are chaotic, it acts very similarly to an "aligned" [[scroll of scare monster]], causing non-chaotic monsters to flee if you stand on its square while it is on the ground. Nighthorn can be #[[invoked]] for [[levitation]].

===Strategy===
As unicorn horns are one-handed in dNetHack, Nighthorn is a much more viable and valuable weapon, though it does poorly against [[demon]]s and other monsters with [[fire resistance]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
Nighthorn has no encyclopedia entry; however, the parser recognizes the "[[Horn#Encyclopedia entry|horn]]" in "nighthorn", and will return the encyclopedia entry for that item.

''The Eye of the Beholder'' is the reward for the [[Neutral Quest]] in [[SLASH'EM]], along with the Key of Neutrality.  It provides no effects when carried or wielded, but has some (rather nasty) effects when invoked.

You will be asked for confirmation when trying to [[eat]] the eye. If you eat it, you will take 150&ndash;199 damage, so this is a [[Bad idea]] ("This Eye of the Beholder is delicious!  You feel a burning inside!"). If you should survive eating the Eye, it provides 10 nutrition.

You can sacrifice the eye at any time ("You offer this evil thing to <your god>..."); this gets rid of it permanently.

==Generation==
As with the other two alignment quest artifacts, you must kill the [[Beholder (SLASH'EM)|Beholder]] in such a manner as to leave a corpse to obtain the Eye. [[Wish]]ing for the Eye will always fail. 

==Invoking==
Invoking the Eye has two possible effects. If your [[luck]] is less than &minus;9, then the Eye "turns on you!" and you [[instadeath|die instantly]].{{refsrc|artifact.c|1613|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} Otherwise, it "looks around with its icy gaze!" and all non-undead monsters in lit area in line of sight are reduced to {{frac|3}} of their remaining hitpoints.{{refsrc|artifact.c|1621|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} This will never kill any monsters directly. This affects tame, peaceful, and hostile monsters equally, but it will not reduce tameness or anger peacefuls. Invoking the Eye has the further effect of reducing your [[alignment record]] and [[Luck]] by 3 each.

==Strategy==
In general, this is the weakest of the alignment quest artifacts, given that it has no use other than its invocation, which is a somewhat mixed effect at best. You can as well just [[sacrifice]] it. Still, it could be useful for clearing out special rooms such as zoos and throne rooms, although you should make sure to [[spellbook of light|light up]] the room beforehand. 

==Origin==

From the famous literary quote: "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder". "Beholder" is a less frequent English word for "observer".

Also an obvious inspiration for the [[Beholder (SLASH'EM)|Beholder]] itself.

==History==
The Eye's "icy gaze" appeared in [[SLASH 6]], a precursor to [[SLASH'EM]], as the invocation effect of the [[The Hand of Vecna#History|Eye of Vecna]], a defunct [[artifact]] which was an alternate [[death drop]] for [[Vecna]].
