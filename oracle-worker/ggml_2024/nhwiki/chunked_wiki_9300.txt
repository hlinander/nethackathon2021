=== Monster changes ===

==== Zombies ====

* Probably the most significant monster change imported from EvilHack.
* Zombies now have two different attack types, one being a poisonous claw attack (effects and frequency are the same as a bite from a rabid rat), the other being a disease-inducing bite attack to the head. The latter is a very serious threat, as the ability to cure oneself from being [[terminally ill]] are almost non-existent in the early game. 
* If the player becomes ill from a zombie bite, they only have a few turns to cure themselves, or they will die and turn into a zombie. 
* This zombie can be encountered by other players if a bones file is generated. 
* There is a very small chance that the player will be able to continue playing if they are turned into a zombie;  however, they will be stuck in that form for the remainder of the game. 
* A zombie's bite attack also has a chance of causing [[amnesia]]. 
* Eating a zombie corpse will make the player ill and cause them to start turning into a zombie (tins of zombie meat 'cure' the meat and make it safe to eat). 
* Attacking zombies at range and wearing a piece of armor that protects your head are highly recommended. 
* Zombies can make other monsters terminally ill as well - the same methods used by the player to cure themselves of a terminal illness can be used/applied on monsters or pets also.

'''In Hack'EM there are a few additional ways to deal with zombies:'''
* Play as a Convict, Undead Slayer, or Necromancer. They all start with sickness resistance.
* Undead slayers deal extra damage versus undead. In addition, they are able to obliterate zombies so they don't leave corpses.
* Wear a tinfoil hat or a dunce cap protect you from the brains eating attack.
* Wearing a Ring of Psychic Resistance will also protect you from the amnesia attack, but not the sickness.
* Playing as an illithid will protect you from the brain eating attacks.

==== Dragons ==== 

* Significantly enhanced, they spawn with many more hit points (especially in the end game).
* Can engulf and digest creatures smaller than them.
* Can now bellow a frightful roar that causes Afraid status.
* Since they can roar, All adult dragons resist sonic damage.
* Only half of dragons are capable of roaring, and the engulf attack has been removed from half of the dragons.
* To offset their powerful abilities, dragons periodically slumber. Running from a dragon and hoping it decides to rest is a valid strategy (SpliceHack).
* A couple of things will now protect you from dragon roars:
** Being a knight (they are naturally trained to fight dragons)
** Wearing Dragonbane or Pridwen
** Being confused
** Having Psychic Resistance

* Yellow dragons get a passive acid attack instead of corrosion to mirror the YDS behavior.

==== Elementals ====

* The new elementals (from SpliceHack) can engulf creatures smaller than them. 
* Some elementals can be zapped and transformed depending on the ray type.
* Ex: Zapping a water elemental with a wand of cold turns it into an ice elemental.
* All elementals (except ice elementals) resist sonic damage.

==== Ghosts ====

* Ghosts and all incorporeal monsters can only be hit with blessed, silver, or bone objects.
* They can also turn invisible and reappear - scaring (and paralyzing) the player for a few turns.
* Ghosts now cannot be renamed (xnh).

** The EvilHack gnolls have been merged with the SLASH'EM gnolls. 
** Gnolls still use the G symbol and the base attributes of the SLASH'EM version.
** Gnolls use the EvilHack weight and size, and get poison resistance, infravisible, and berzerk.
* '''Baby gray dragons''' get MR20 (twice the other baby dragons).
* '''Gremlins''' always gremlin. Midnight is irrelevant. Applies to both polymorphed player and dungeon monsters. (fiq)
* '''Giant beetles''' and '''giant spiders''' had their weight increased.
* '''Gnome Kings''' have been raised to lvl 9, gnome warriors to 7.

* '''Ice Devils''' get an additional slow attack.

** Any monster, should it get a hold of the Amulet of Yendor, can and will sacrifice it on an endgame altar.

* Priests, soldiers, the watch, and player monsters can also be a variety of different races.

* Pets that explode will attack anything. This includes flame spheres and freezing spheres for flame and ice mages.

=== Monster Mechanic Changes ===

==== Berserking behavior ====

* From EvilHack
* Monsters with this property have the M3_BERSERK tag.
* When berserkers are below 1/3 of their health, they go into berserk mode.
* When berserking, monsters totally ignore Elbereth or Scare Monster. If they are usually skittish or trying to keep away, they will instead actively approach.
* A berserking monster also has a 1 in 3 chance of dealing their max possible damage when hitting you.
* They will also lash out at random monsters to get at you.
* This property has been added to many monsters: all rabid animals, all dwarves, most orcs, all bears, all badgers, all gnolls, most giants, and other monsters where it seems appropriate.

==== Traitorous/betrayal behavior ====

* From SLASH'EM
* Monsters with this property have the M3_TRAITOR tag.
* If tame, monsters with the traitor property have a small chance to betray you on each turn.
* In SLASH'EM this used to depend on the monster's HP being lower than yours, but that condition has been removed and the chance of betraying has been significantly increased.
* Also in SLASH'EM, the chance of a pet betraying was quite low. There was a 1 in 850 chance per turn of the betray check even occurring. The chance of this check has been increased to 1 in 250 each turn.
* All monsters that were traitorous in SLASH'EM/THEM have kept it, and it has been added to various new monsters as appropriate.
* Migos, gargoyles, any thieves, any illithids, any pirates, deep ones, most imps, all kobolds, all orcs, all gnolls, and other various conniving creatures.
* Also closely related is the "untameable" property, which as also been imported from SLASH'EM.
* Necromancers will never be betrayed by their undead pets.

'''How does the betrayed check work?'''

All these conditions must be true:

* The pet is not a minion
* The pet is less than 4 squares away from you.
* The pet is capable of treachery.
* The pet is not mindless.
* Hitting a 1 on a d3 roll.
* Hitting a d22 roll that is greater than the pets tameness (means that the lower the tameness, the higher chance of succeeding)
* Hitting a d(pet's abuse + 2) that isn't 1 (means that even if your pet has not suffered any abuse, there is a 50% chance of the roll succeeding.)

If all these conditions and rolls are met, your pet will become hostile and turn on you. The implications of this mechanic are to be more careful around polytraps - carefully monitor what your pet is polymorphing into, or abandon it if it could threaten you with betrayal.

==== Shield Skill ====

A new trainable skill from EvilHack - using shields. This section has been adapted from the EvilHack commits.

Shield skill gives the player a new avenue of defense (and even offense) to train up. Roles that can highly train shields will benefit from much higher AC and gain some nice offensive bonuses.

'''AC bonuses:'''

* Being unskilled/restricted in shield skill, there is no extra AC bonus for wearing one.
* To get these bonuses, you must be wearing a shield and have the required skill.
* BASIC skill: adds 1AC
* SKILLED skill: adds 3AC
* EXPERT skill: adds 5AC
* MASTER skill:  adds 8AC 

* If your role allows for it, you can train up your shield skill while wearing a shield.
* If you block an attack outright with your shield, that automatically trains shield skill.
* Otherwise, there's a 33% chance of training shield skill while wearing one and a regular miss event occurs.


'''Shield Bashing:'''

* If shield skill is basic or higher, and a shield is being worn, there's a chance the player will receive an extra 'shield bash' attack along with their regular attack
* The greater the shield skill, the greater the chance of the extra shield bash attack occurring.
* Small shields do 2-4 damage, Tower shields do 2-13 damage.
* All other shields do 3-8 damage (not counting material hatred, which is factored in). 
* Expert skill or higher gets an extra small damage bonus
* Expert/master skill in shields gives a chance to stun your target with a shield bash

'''Misc:'''
* If expert skill or higher in shields., your shield will be prevented from being taken away via dwarvish bearded axe attack.

'''The roles that can train in shields are:'''

* Knights and valkyries start at basic skill. 
* Out of all the primary caster roles, only priests can train shield skill, since they already start with one and are typically seen as tank spellcasters.

==== Flanking Behavior ====

* From SpliceHack
* Monsters with this property have the M2_FLANK tag

* Monsters with flanking are "tactical" and known as "outflankers", they will actively seek opportunities to flank the player.
* Monsters gain a large bonus to hit when flanking the player (located on opposite sides of the player's position).
* Flanking now scales with monster level (this used to be a flat +4 AC penalty):
** AC penalty = 4 + (mdiffulty - 4) / 2
* Flanking has been applied to many appropriate monsters in Hack'EM.

* Using a pet, you can also take advantage of flanking. Simply place yourself and your pet in such a way as to "sandwich" the  monster. You (and your pet) will each get a +4 to-hit bonus on the victim.

Flanking restrictions:
* You cannot flank if hallucinating, afraid, confused, punished, fumbling, wounded, or stunned. You must also be able to see the monster you want to flank.
* Monsters cannot flank if sleeping, fleeing, confused, trapped, being stoned, sick, diseased, or stunned.

==== Monster hit point generation ====

* is now determined by their size as well as what level they are.
* They also have the same armor class damage reduction that players enjoy.

==== Intelligent monsters ====

* Mostly from evil, but a fair amount of monster usage code has come from Splice, Un, and xnh
* Intelligent monsters/pets can use many more items against the player or for their own benefit, including:
** stashing objects into bags and taking them back out
** unlocking and looting locked containers
** activating any figurines it may have
** wearing most rings
** reading scrolls of remove curse to uncurse items in its inventory
** scrolls of charging to recharge wands in its possession
** utilizing powerful wands against the player
* If an intelligent monster is lucky enough to get a wish from a smoky potion - it WILL wish for something to use against the player.

==== Player monsters ====

* From EvilHack
* Player monsters are now technically their own class of monster and are separate from how the actual player is defined in src/monst.c, and were purposely left out of the new monsters table as it would unnecessarily inflate that list.
* Player monsters differ here from vanilla NetHack in that they can spawn outside of the Astral Plane, are yellow in color, and are kitted out in player-like gear starting at level 10, and then can be kitted out with ascension-level gear starting at level 20.
* Their hit dice and difficulty level roughly matches that of the actual player (this is based off of what experience level the actual player is when the player monster spawns). 
* Their abilities closely match their role as well (wizards and priests can cast spells, rogues can steal items from inventory, etc). 
* Player monsters from EvilHack covet the Amulet of Yendor and will attempt to steal it, and if they steal it while on the Astral Plane, will attempt to sacrifice it themselves. As you can imagine, if that happens, it is a game-ending event.

==== Shape-changing monsters ====

* (except for vampires and were-creatures) will revert back to their original form when their polymorphed form dies.
* They cannot change form again once this happens.

==== Other behavior that needs documentation ====

M3_ACCURATE
M3_SKITTISH
M3_DISPLACES
M4_VULNERABLE_FIRE
M4_VULNERABLE_COLD
M4_VULNERABLE_ELEC
M4_VULNERABLE_ACID

MR_SONIC
M2_JUMPER

=== Unique Monster Changes ===

* '''[[The Oracle]]''' sometimes gets a potion of hallucination. (xnh)

'''[[Medusa]]'''

* Medusa has been enhanced; she is no longer an easy kill. 
* Her hit points and level have been boosted.
* She spawns wielding an enchanted orcish bow with a quiver full of enchanted and poisoned orcish arrows. 
* The snakes on her head can attack (poisonous bite) and her own bite causes slow-stoning. 
* Her gaze is still of the instant petrification type. 
* Having reflection is no longer a guaranteed kill, she resists most of the time.
* When defeated, a pegasus will arise from her body (From SLASH'EM)

'''Demon lords/princes'''

* along with which lair they may appear in, has been completely randomized. 
* Your experience in Gehennom can be a very different experience per game.


'''[[Juiblex]]'''

'''The Wizard of Yendor'''

* can use any artifact weapons or armor that he steals against the player.
* Color changed to bright magenta.
* The frequency of Rodney's harassment of the player now slightly depends on luck.
* Lower Rodney's AC from -8 to -6 (from EvilHack)

'''The Riders'''

* Identity of the Riders hidden via farlook or 'More info about' prompt. (from evil, Un)
