{{encyclopedia|
"You shall have no other gods before Me.

You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.

[ SCP-1348, SCP Foundation ]

…not afraid of The Lord, for He is as we are, broken and scattered. As we restore the body of God, so we restore ourselves. To join with the Lord is good. As we give honor and worship to the Lord, so does He honor us. To serve the Lord is good. As we guard the Lord from harm, so does He…

[ Church of the Broken God Bible Fragments, SCP Foundation ]
}}

'''Binding Ritual'''

An eroded item (rusty, corroded, rotted, or burnt) item must be placed in the seal. The item is repaired as part of the ritual. Negative enchantment is also fixed, but a negatively enchanted item is not sufficient for the ritual to proceed, the item must also be eroded.

'''Skill'''

Astaroth grants skill in crossbows and shuriken.

*'''Astaroth's Shards''': Fires a barrage of shuriken along random ranks. The barrage consists of shuriken equal to your die size + your level/10 + 1. You take damage equal to your die size. The barrage may be concentrated by activating it while standing in a corridor or other narrow space.

== Enki, God of the First City ==
{{encyclopedia|
The main temple to Enki is called E-abzu, meaning "abzu temple" (also E-en-gur-a, meaning "house of the subterranean waters"), a ziggurat temple surrounded by Euphratean marshlands near the ancient Persian Gulf coastline at Eridu. He was the keeper of the divine powers called Me, the gifts of civilization. His image is a double-helix snake, or the Caduceus, very similar to the Rod of Asclepius used to symbolize medicine. He is often shown with the horned crown of divinity dressed in the skin of a carp.

Considered the master shaper of the world, god of wisdom and of all magic, Enki was characterized as the lord of the Abzu (Apsu in Akkadian), the freshwater sea or groundwater located within the earth. In the later Babylonian epic Enûma Eliš, Abzu, the "begetter of the gods", is inert and sleepy but finds his peace disturbed by the younger gods, so sets out to destroy them. His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu "casting him into a deep sleep", thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home "in the depths of the Abzu." Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his fertilising powers as lord of the waters and lord of semen.

== Eurynome, the Lonely Dancer ==
{{encyclopedia|
In the beginning, Eurynome,
The Goddess of All Things,
Rose naked from Chaos.

She found nothing upon
Which to rest her feet, and thus,
She divided the sea from the sky.

She danced lonely upon
The waves of the sea.

She danced towards the South, and
The Wind set in motion behind her
Seemed something new and strange
With which to begin a work of creation.

Wheeling about, she caught hold of
This North wind, rubbed it between
Her hands, and behold!
The great serpent Ophion. 

[...]

Eurynome and Ophion made their home upon
Mount Olympus where he vexed her by
Claiming to be the author of the Universe.

Forthwith, she bruised his head with her heel,
Kicked out his teeth, and banished him to the
Dark caves below the Earth

[...]

She took joy in her creation, but soon found
Herself alone desiering the face, voice,
Ear and warmth of another of her own.

Eurynome stood up and once again
Began to dance alone upon the waves. 

[ The Pelasgian Creation Myth by Dr. James Luchte,
  Adapted from Roberts Graves's The Greek Myths ]

== Jack, of the Lantern ==
{{encyclopedia|
 Once in the land of Eire, there lived a blacksmith by the name of Jack. Quick to the drink but short on paying for it, Jack had few friends and was known to curse a lovely day as often as a miserable one.

One night late, when all civil folk were home abed, Jack was at a pub near the crossroads outside his village. A stranger in a long coat and hat sat near. Hoping for sympathy, Jack moaned aloud that he would give his soul to the Devil if he had the money for one last drink. Quick as can be, the stranger beside him disappeared and close to Jack's hand lay the coins for his drink.

Now although Jack was a drinking man, he was also a clever man and he knew now that stranger was no mere man. Being the thinking man, Jack snatched the coins from the counter and pocketed them in his purse where he kept a small silver cross. Trapped by the silver cross, the stranger, who was actually the Devil in disguise, had to agree not to claim Jack's soul for another ten years in order to escape Jack's pocket.

Now time went by and as time does and Jack's ways never changed. Without family or friend, Jack contented himself walking about late after the pub had closed and one night, ten years hence, he came across the Devil himself on a dark country road.

The Devil reminded Jack of their bargain and Jack, still not eager to leave life, agreed to go if the Devil would feed his terrible hunger with an apple from a nearby tree. Hopping upon Jack's shoulder's, the Devil hoisted himself into the tree to get the apple. Quickly Jack took his small knife and carved a cross in the tree. Now as we all know, the Devil has no power in the air and was trapped in the tree by the cross on its trunk. This time Jack made the Devil promise never to come for him again. Having no choice, the Devil agreed.

Some years later, Jack did meet his natural end. Because of his miserly and drinking ways, he was denied entrance to Heaven. The Devil himself turned him away at the entrance to Hell because he had promised years before never to take his soul. As the night was dark and the wind was howling, Jack begged the Devil for light to find his way. The Devil threw him an ember from the very fires of hell and Jack kept it lit inside a bit of rotten turnip that he found.

Ever since then, Jack has wandered the night with his wee lantern. He was seen from time to time, and still is, a bobbing light in the darkness, on windy nights out on the moors or along lonely country roads. He became known as "Jack-of-the Lantern," and over time just "Jack-o-Lantern."

== Mother, who beheld beauty ==
{{encyclopedia|
I rolled my wheelchair over to the bookcase and pulled down the battered medical encyclopedia that I'd 
had for years. The book was maddeningly vague. It could have been anything, or nothing. I leaned back and closed my eyes. I could hear the old ship's clock ticking on the shelf across the room.

There was the high, thin drone of a jet on its way to Miami. There was the soft whisper of my own breath.

I was still looking at the book.

The realization crept on me, then sank home with a frightening rush. My eyes were closed, but I was still looking at the book. What I was seeing was smeary and monstrous, the distorted, fourth-dimensional counterpart of a book, yet unmistakable for all that.

And I was not the only one watching.

[ I am the doorway, by Stephen King ]

== Orthos, Sovereign of the Howling Dark ==

{{encyclopedia|
In the dark there is something that will always be a shade darker than the lightless black, as though it drew back the night like a curtain. That thing can be heard, even across the inconceivable gulf that separates the place of the vestiges and the known Multiverse. The faintest whisper suggests a howl as maddening as it is endless.

== Otiax, the Key to the Gate ==
{{encyclopedia|
Rhian stood within a circle of protection made from powdered diamonds. The hairs on her goose-bump speckled skin stood on end, the energy of wards and bufferings making her clenched teeth hum. Seed magic, beyond the arcane ability of almost all sorcerers and wizards. She could survive dragons, giants, waves of entropy, or even the stress of warping space-time.

Yet she was afraid, as were all of the conjurers in their own diamond circles that surrounded a larger circle which circumscribed her own along with a red-black blood-painted circle of binding. She could see it on their faces, even those demented alienists who were in truth prisoners barred from leaving the School's grounds. They seemed to be confounded that anyone might claim rulership over the Far Realms, yet rather than disdain their faces showed a newly minted fear of the plane they'd given themselves over to.

[...]

Two binders of Otiax shifted uncomfortably, throwing glances at the locked iron doors that led out of this vast summoning chamber. The Key to the Gate, a vestige believed to have some connection to the Far Realm, would perhaps provide some revelations of its own to this event. It seemed dangerous and Thaakir had proclaimed their presence the very epitome of mages' obsession with knowledge leading to their downfall. But it had been Rhian who had calmed him. She sensed, in a way that no one else could, that the vestiges would not let her come to harm. Their need for her, palpable across realities, ensured their lack of betrayal.
