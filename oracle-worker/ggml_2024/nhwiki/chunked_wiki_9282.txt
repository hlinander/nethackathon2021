'''Ancients of the burning wastes''' are a possible inhabitant of an ancient-nupperibo-[[hellish seal]]. They are notable for their very dangerous 2-square-reach melee attack, difficult-to-resist breath attack, constant re-location, noticeable physical damage, and ability to relocate the character.

==2-square reach attack: mummy rot==

When used against other monsters, this attack deals heavy damage.

When used against the player character, the character begins rotting to dust. While the first hit merely begins the process, subsequent hits reduce Constitution or Charisma by 1 to 6 points. If both scores are 3 or less after an instance of this damage, the character dies.

==Spellcasting==

The ancient only uses two spells.

===Spacewarp: blades===

This spell deals normal spellcasting damage (5d5 or 5 - 25, for the typical ancient of the burning wastes) to the target. This damage can be resisted both by half physical damage and half magical damage.

===Spacewarp: throw===

The target is thrown 8 squares in a random direction.
==Consuming breath==

An ancient of the burning wastes inhales moisture and exhales sweltering heat.

===Inhalation: moisture===

"Bloody mist rises from your skin."

The inhalation affects one valid target within 4 squares of the ancient at random. A valid target is one that is either not "anhydrous" or that has blood.

The attack deals 1d5 damage per 3 levels of the ancient (so 5d5 for the typical ancient). If the target has blood and doesn't resist level drain, the attack also drains one level.

===Exhalation: sweltering heat===

"Heat shimmers surround the ancient of the burning wastes!"

All valid targets within 8 squares of the ancient are damaged. Valid targets are those that lack fire resistance or that are non-living. A target that is both non-living and lacks fire resistance takes double damage. The attack deals 1d5 damage per 3 levels of the ancient (so 5d5 for the typical ancient).

Finally, if the player character is within 8 squares of the ancient, the ancient relocates within reach of the character.

==Strategy==

Due to its constant relocation, it is difficult to confront an ancient of the burning wastes with melee attacks. Strong ranged attacks may be used, though many spells and wands are blocked by the ancient's reflection. If the player finds it difficult to confront the ancient, they would be well-advised to use an [[escape item]] to retreat and obtain [[sustain ability]] to avoid being killed by mummy rot.

==Origin==

dNetHack '''ancients''' are very loosely based on D&D [https://rilmani.org/timaresh/Baatorian Ancient Baatorians]. Only two examples of ancient baatorians were actually encountered during the period in which they were introduced: a nupperibo with constitution-draining tentacles (stated to be a [[Nupperibo#Metamorphosed_nupperibo|metamorphosing, larval baatorian]]) and a shapeless thing that inhales light/reflectivity and life and exhales darkness. There were also said to be [[Nupperibo#Ancient_nupperibo|spined creatures frozen deep under the ice in Cania]]. A later source claimed that [https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zargon Zargon] was another ancient baatorian, but Zargon originated over a decade before the later idea of ancient baatorians (and over two decades before the source tying them together) and is obviously unrelated.

'''Ancients of thought''' are a possible inhabitant of an ancient-nupperibo-[[hellish seal]]. They are notable for their painful stings, their ability to pick up and throw boulders, and their extremely dangerous breath attacks.

==Melee attack: jellyfish sting==

Monsters struck by this attack lose movement points, and may be stun-locked if hit frequently enough.

The player character instead begins [[Temporary_madness#screaming|screaming]]. This alerts all monsters on the level of your true position, and prevents talking, spellcasting, and scroll-reading ([[syllable]]s of power can still be used).

==Consuming breath==

An ancient of thought inhales thoughts and exhales terrible cries.

===Inhalation: thoughts===

"Your mind goes numb."

The inhalation affects one non-mindless target within 4 squares of the ancient at random. The player character is never considered to be mindless, even if polymorphed into a mindless form.

The attack deals 1-5 (1d5) intelligence damage. This damage may cause the character to die of [[brainlessness]]. Higher-level ancients gain 1 face on the die per 3 levels (e.g., 1d6 damage at 18th level).

[[Half spell damage]] and [[Syllable#Vaul.2C_the_syllable_of_spirit|vaul]] reduce this damage. Dunce caps protect against this damage, but non-artifact dunce caps are disenchanted and eventually destroyed at -5 enchantment.

===Exhalation: terrible cry===

"The ancient of thought screams into your mind!"

The exhalation affects one living, non-mindless target within 8 squares of the ancient. The player character will be targeted if in range, otherwise the target is chosen randomly.

Targets with less than 100 current HP are killed outright, targets with more than 100 current HP are instead heavily damaged. If the character is targeted, they may begin [[Temporary_madness#panicking|panicking]].

All non-mindless targets on the level other than the primary target are affected similarly to a [[mind blast]] attack, with a telepathy-dependent chance taking moderate damage. This effect will occur even if there was no primary target chosen (which could occur if there were no valid targets in range).

==Strategy==

The breath attack is extremely dangerous. If the character is vulnerable to one or both components of the attack, it is wise to use an [[escape item]] and come back with [[sustain ability]] and/or a [[dunce cap]]. A dunce cap also prevents the exhalation from occurring, so it should be preferred for most characters.

The '''orb of maintenance''' is a [[magical item|magical]] [[tool]] that appears in [[NetHack brass]]. It appears as a "[[glass orb]]" when unidentified.

==Effect==
Applying an orb of enchantment with charges allows you to repair erosion on a selected object. The effect is dependent on [[beatitude]] - an uncursed orb reduces erosion, a blessed orb completely repairs the item, and a cursed orb increases erosion.

==Strategy==
All non-[[crystal ball]] glass orbs have a base price of 750 [[zm]], making it trivial to distinguish them from crystal balls via [[price identification]] - beyond this, all glass orbs weigh 75 [[aum]], meaning that the three non-crystal ball orbs can only be distinguished through formal [[identification]] or use-testing. The latter is risky since you may possibly trigger an [[orb of destruction]].

An '''eldritch ki-rin''', {{black|A}} is a monster that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is a "fallen" variant of the [[ki-rin]].

==Generation==
Unlike normal ki-rin, eldritch ki-rin primarily generate in Gehennom, as well as the floors below [[Medusa's Island]].

==Strategy==
As a steed, the eldritch ki-rin is effectively an alternative to the standard ki-rin for chaotic [[Knights]], who cannot tame ki-rin; likewise, eldritch ki-rin cannot be tamed by lawful Knights.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The ki-rin is a strange-looking flying creature.  It has scales, a mane like a lion, a tail, hooves, and a horn.  It is brightly colored, and can usually be found flying in the sky looking for good deeds to reward.

An eldritch ki-rin is one that started its celestial life as a normal lawful ki-rin, and at some point lost its way and started following a path of darkness.  In nearly all aspects, they are identical to their lawful brethren. The differences are that their alignment is strongly chaotic, and their appearance is extremely dark.

It is compiled by looking at all of a player's [[ascension]]s and assigning 1 point for the first ascension of a [[role]], 1/2 a point for the second ascension, 1/3 for the third, and so on. Z-score encourages playing the complete set of roles rather than repeatedly ascending the same role. For example:

:::{| class="wikitable" style=width:15em

The repository is available at https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack-Rewrite.

Major changes:
* No more [[techniques]], they were too buggy. Role-specific skills will be implemented to fulfill a similar conceptual niche.
* Boring and uneventful things, such as [[cooking]], moonstones, and many monsters, are also gone.
* For further details, see the [https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack-Rewrite/blob/Spl-R-1.0.0/README.md README] and the [https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack-Rewrite/blob/Spl-R-1.0.0/doc/changelog.md changelog].
* YANIs can be posted to [https://hardfought.org/etherpad/p/SpliceHack etherpad], with no guarantees or warranties implied.
* Many SpliceHack wiki pages may need to be replaced, overhauled, or deleted when the Rewrite is ready. Again, referring to the changelog and readme are your best sources, or of course diving the details of the commits on Github.

== Rules Changes ==

The following table details the largest general differences between SpliceHack-Rewrite and Vanila NetHack. Reading them is ''heavily'' encouraged for new players. Details are kept intentionally vague on this page, in order to avoid spoilers.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Category
! Rules Changes
! Gameplay Outcomes
|-
| Cursed Items
| 
* Cursed weapons no longer weld themselves to the wielder's hands. Rather, a cursed weapon will occasionally produce strange effects when swung, such as spontaneously breaking, or hitting the wielder in the face.
* After killing enough monsters with a weapon, the weapon will automatically identify itself.
| Testing weapons you find on the ground is much less risky, encouraging experimentation, but curses on weapons in the late game are much more dangerous and impactful.
|-
| Altars
| 
* Converting a cross-aligned altar will always result in a hostile minion being summoned.
| Converting altars is much more risky.
|-
| Endgame
|
* There are seven elemental planes in the endgame, rather than four.
| The endgame is longer, and more scrolls of gold detection may be necessary.
|-
| Food
|
* After praying away starvataion multiple times, the prayer timeout permanently increases. This increase grows larger with each successive hunger prayer.
* While the player is experience level one, they hunger much more slowly.
* Food item and corpse generation are extremely rare in most new branches.
* Food item generation in Gehennom is greatly reduced.
| Starving to death in the early game is less likely, but time pressure later in the game is more intense. Additionally, exploring a branch may cost the player precious time.
|-
| Combat
|
* Monsters gain a large bonus to their to-hit roll when an ally is located on the opposite side of the player.
* Any non-tame monster that kills another monster will instantly grow up, regardless of level limitations.
| Positioning in combat is critical.

The '''Mouser's Scalpel''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. It is [[neutral]] for wishing purposes, and its [[base item]] is a [[rapier]].

==Description==
The Mouser's Scalpel grants +5 [[to-hit]] and +1 damage, and has a unique mechanic that allows it to deliver extra "attacks" on a hit which will do '''+1d8 + 1 + <enchantment>''' (regardless of whether the target is small or large). The extra hits have an initial 20% to proc one of these extra blows, and then a {{frac|5|11}} chance of subsequently inflicting additional hits of damage until it fails to proc.<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/develop/src/artifact.c#L1503 SlashTHEM src/artifact.c, line 1503]</ref>

==Strategy==
The chance for extra blows to stack means that in theory, the wielder may be lucky enough to continually strike a foe indefinitely until they are killed.

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

Given unique nature of the added hits, we first need to find the expected number of hits per swing of the weapon. Given that the initial proc has an 80% chance of no hits, a 20% chance of the first hit, and the probability '''''p''''' of subsequent hits after that, we can write the equation as:

{|class="wikitable"
!Expected number of hits
|-
| <math>0*80%+(1+\frac{1}{1-p})*20%=(1+\frac{11}{6})*20%=\bold{0.57}</math> 
|}

With this we can then calculate the expected amount of damage from the proc as:

{|class="wikitable"
!Expected damage from extra hits
|-
| <math>(\frac{1+8}{2}+1+enchant)*57%=\bold{3.12+enchant*57%}</math> 
|}

{|class="wikitable"
!Weapon
!Small monsters
!Large monsters
|-
| +0 Mouser's Scalpel
| <math>\frac{1+6}{2}+1+3.12=\bold{7.62}</math>
| <math>\frac{1+8}{2}+1+3.12=\bold{8.62}</math>
|-
| +7 Mouser's Scalpel
| <math>\frac{1+6}{2}+1+3.12+ 7*57% +7=\bold{18.61}</math> 
| <math>\frac{1+8}{2}+1+3.12+ 7*57% +7=\bold{19.61}</math>
|-
| +9 Mouser's Scalpel
| <math>\frac{1+6}{2}+1+3.12+ 9*57% +9=\bold{21.75}</math> 
| <math>\frac{1+8}{2}+1+3.12+ 9*57% +9=\bold{22.75}</math>
|}

==History==
The Mouser's Scalpel first appeared in [[SLASH 6]] as one of the many "Newhon" artifacts;<ref name="newhon">[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/commit/ef462f27264bbb56251d37cd0e2be6c0cb051d12 SlashTHEM commit ef462f2: Revive the Newhon Artifacts from SLASH 6]</ref><!--see if we can't figure out some more details about this--> it was then known simply as '''Scalpel''' (not to be confused with a [[Healer]]'s [[scalpel]]), and became a [[deferred]] item within the data of [[SLASH'EM]], which carried over its code.{{refsrc|artifact.c|1244|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} <ref name="readme">[https://github.com/k21971/SlashEM/blob/8d5529799ad7ef36ed1eeca00f67a1d65c8e9c53/readme.s6#L41 SLASH'EM readme.s, line 41]</ref>The artifact was renamed and reintroduced to the game in SlashTHEM, adapted from BarclayII's SlashEM-Up project.<ref name="newhon"/>

==Origin==
The Mouser's Scalpel comes from the ''[[wikipedia:Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser|Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]]'' stories by [[Fritz Leiber]], where it is the titular Gray Mouser's trademark weapon. His prowess in swordsmanship is reflected in its ability to strike multiple blows.

&&%s&& %s Nymph (monster class) {147682 2022-08-19T23:09:38Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} sp The '''nymph''' is a [[monster class]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' represented by a lowercase n ({{white|n}}). The class contains three [[nymph]] species:

* {{monsym|water nymph}} water nymph
* {{monsym|wood nymph}} wood nymph
* {{monsym|mountain nymph}} mountain nymph

==Common traits==
All nymphs are almost exactly the same in terms of stats and generation, with the exception of the water nymph's ability to [[swim]]. The monster class is defined by the macro <code>S_NYMPH</code> in <code>include/monsym.h</code>.

Nymphs will not directly attack you and have poor AC, but are nevertheless very dangerous - they can charm you into removing your [[armor]], stealing it and/or other items before attempting to [[teleport]] away. They are also capable of using said items - putting on armor and [[amulet]]s, zapping [[wand]]s and quaffing [[potion]]s.

Nymphs will teleport at random while moving, making them hard to track down - eating a nymph's corpse has a chance of giving you [[teleportitis]].

==History==
The nymph is one of the monsters included in [[Hack 1.0]], being introduced in ''Hack for PDP-11'' (a [[variant]] of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]]) - from [[Hack 1.0]] to [[NetHack 2.3e]], nymphs used the {{white|N}} glyph. The nymph was replaced with the three distinct subtypes starting in [[NetHack 3.0.0]], and they were moved to the {{white|n}} glyph.

==Variants==
Many variants add new monsters to the nymph class and expand on their common traits, taking cues from the ancient Greek folklore they originated in - [[Aphrodite]] and the [[nymph level]] are also common additions to variants, first appearing in [[SLASH'EM]].

===SLASH'EM===
SLASH'EM adds some new monsters to the nymph monster class:

* {{monsymlink|pixie}}
* {{monsymlink|brownie}}
* {{monsymlink|quickling}}
* {{monsymlink|Aphrodite}}

===UnNetHack===
[[UnNetHack]] includes Aphrodite and the nymph level as well, but does not add any other new monsters to the class.

===SlashTHEM===
[[SlashTHEM]] retains most of the newly added nymphs from SLASH'EM, and adds a couple of new monsters:

* {{brown|n}} [[satyr]]
* {{magenta|n}} [[nymph queen]]

SlashTHEM also includes a "plain" [[Nymph (SlashTHEM)|nymph]] to represent the [[Nymph (starting race)|playable nymph race]].

===EvilHack===
[[EvilHack]] contains Aphrodite and the nymph level, and also adds the [[ice nymph]], which primarily appears in the [[Ice Queen's Realm]].

===dNetHack===
[[dNetHack]] renames and changed the three nymphs from vanilla, and adds several other members to the monster class:

* {{brightblue|n}} [[quickling]]
* {{green|n}} [[dryad]]
* {{blue|n}} [[naiad]]
* {{brown|n}} [[oread]]
* {{magenta|n}} [[swamp nymph]]
* {{brightcyan|n}} [[yuki-onna]]
* {{white|n}} [[deminymph]]
* {{red|n}} [[neverwas]]
* {{yellow|n}} [[thriae]]
* {{brown|n}} [[selkie]]
* {{blue|n}} [[oceanid]]
* {{brightmagenta|n}} [[intoner]]
* Unique monsters

The '''orc''', {{monsym|orc}}, is a [[monster]] that formerly appeared in ''[[NetHack]]''. It serves as the "base" monster for the [[corpse]] left by killing an [[orc zombie]] or [[orc mummy]].

==Generation==
Orcs are [[Monster creation|not randomly generated]], with the exception of a game that has [[Orcish Town]] present - various named orcs can appear among the [[orc (monster attribute)|orcish monsters]] carrying looted items.{{refsrc|src/mkmaze.c|740|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} They [[Monster starting inventory|will also generate with]] [[scimitar]]s or [[orcish dagger]]s along with [[orcish helm]]s.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|397|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mkmaze.c|797|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Orcs can also be created by zapping a [[wand of undead turning]] at a orc corpse that is not left by a mummy or zombie, or selecting orcs when reading a [[cursed]] [[scroll of genocide]]. Orcs can [[grow up]] to become [[orc-captain]]s.

==Strategy==
"Plain" orcs are not too substantially different from [[hobgoblins]] and [[hill orcs]], and can be defeated with much of the same tactics. Pursuing any orcs you encounter during a game with Orcish Town is generally a good idea in order to nab the [[candle]]s and [[gloves]] they may be carrying.

==History==
The orc is one of the many monsters present in the earliest variants of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]] as well as [[Andries Brouwer]]'s [[Hack 1.0]], and continued to appear as late as [[NetHack 2.3e]]. In its appearances, orcs often generated in hordes similar to [[hill orcs]] in modern ''NetHack''.

In [[NetHack 3.0.0]], the various types of orcs were introduced, alongside or zombies and mummies - the base orc remains in the game's data primarily for the purpose of generating the corpses used by their undead.{{refsrc|src/monst.c|624|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Named orcs appearing as looters in a game with Orcish Town became possible in [[NetHack 3.6.2]] with changes made to the generation method used for creating the looting monsters.{{refsrc|src/mkmaze.c|804|version=NetHack 3.6.2}}

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Orc}}
The orcs in ''NetHack'' are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which in turn are based on their portrayal in the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], seventeen plain orcs are placed randomly around the outside of [[Grund's Stronghold]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Orcs, bipeds with a humanoid appearance, are related to the
goblins, but much bigger and more dangerous.  The average orc
is only moderately intelligent, has broad, muscled shoulders,
a short neck, a sloping forehead and a thick, dark fur.
Their lower eye-teeth are pointing forward, like a boar's.
Female orcs are more lightly built and bare-chested.  Not
needing any clothing, they do like to dress in variegated
apparels.  Suspicious by nature, orcs live in tribes or
hordes.  They tend to live underground as well as above
ground (but they dislike sunlight).  Orcs can use all weapons,
tools and armors that are used by men.  Since they don't have
the talent to fashion these themselves, they are constantly
hunting for them.  There is nothing a horde of orcs cannot
use.

The '''grid xorn''', {{magenta|X}}, is a monster that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. It is a [[xorn]] counterpart to the [[grid bug]].

==Generation==
Grid xorns, like grid bugs, are among the earliest monsters you can encounter in the main dungeon.

==Strategy==
Grid xorns are essentially grid bug-xorn hybrids - they can [[Phasing|walk through walls]], [[metallivore|eat metal]], [[Monsters with hits creatures as a %2Bx weapon (SLASH'EM)|hit as a +1 weapon]] and are also [[Thick-skinned|resistant to being]] [[kick]]ed. Despite all this, grid xorns are no stronger than grid bugs and still restricted to four-directional movement - they can be easily dispatched by all but the unluckiest characters.

==Description==
When worn, it grants a +2 bonus to [[AC]] in addition to its base AC and enchantment, and additionally provides [[hallucination resistance]]. Musa-Shiya can be #[[invoked]] to provide [[enlightenment]].

==Origin==
Musa-Shiya is named for an iconic brand of Hawaiian shirt created by tailor Koichiro "Musa-Shiya" Miyamoto<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/include/artilist.h#L322 SlashTHEM artilist.h, line 322]</ref> - the name came from his father Chotaro, who emigrated to Hawai'i from Musashi Province, Japan, and started a store named after his home province.

&&%s&& %s Skills (SpliceHack) {146089 2022-06-01T19:46:41Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Freezing fists */ == Animal friendship ==

This is specific to [[Ranger]]s.

    Animal friendship makes animals spawn peaceful. This effect is influenced by
    skill level.

== Backstab ==

This is specific to [[Rogue]]s and [[Tourist]]s.

    Backstab increases the damage the user deals when attacking from behind,
    or, if the user is not a rogue, gives them the ability to backstab. Maximum
    backstab damage is multiplied by one plus the skill level.

== Blood magic ==

This is specific to [[Wizard]]s.

    Blood magic allows you to draw on your own life force to cast spells. If you
    would normally not have enough energy to cast a spell, you can cast it using
    your own hit points as a power source. Magic cast in such a way is more powerful
    than standard magic.

== Blood rage ==

This is specific to [[Barbarian]]s.

    Blood rage provides a bonus to melee weapon damage as long as you have less than
    one half of your health remaining. This bonus doubles if you have less than one
    quarter your health remaining. Enhancing this skill will increase the damage bonus.

    damage penalty of the same amount.

    for breaking one's code of honor.

== Disarm ==

    Disarm allows the user to use your weapon to attempt to disarm opponents.
    Use the #disarm command to disarm.

== Dragon tamer ==

This is specific to [[Dragon rider]]s.

    Allows the user to tame dragons by chatting with them. Additional ranks in
    dragon tamer increases the chances of success.

== Flaming fists ==

This is specific to [[Monk]]s.

    Flaming fists allows the user to set enemies on fire using their unarmed
    strikes. This increases damage dealt by 1d6 and may destroy potions in the
    defender's inventory.
    The chance of this effect activating on a given attack is skill_level / 20.

== Freezing fists ==

This is specific to [[Monk]]s and [[Valkyrie]]s.

    Freezing fists allows the user to  deal cold damage to enemies using their 
    unarmed strikes. This increases damage dealt by 1d6 and may destroy potions
    in the defender's inventory.
    The chance of this effect activating on a given attack is skill_level / 25.

== Panache ==

This is specific to [[Archaeologist]]s.

    Panache provides a passive bonus to the user's luck.

== Power attack ==

    Power attack increases the damage dealt by the user by a flat amount at the
    cost of a to-hit penalty of the same amount.

== Rat tamer ==

This is specific to [[Convict]]s.

    Allows the user to tame rats by chatting to them. Additional ranks in rat tamer
    increases the chances of success.

== Shocking fists ==

This is specific to [[Monk]]s.

    unarmed strikes. This increases damage dealt by 1d20 and may destroy wands
    in the defender's inventory.
    The chance of this effect activating on a given attack is skill_level / 100.

== Stunning fist ==

    attacks, provided the user already had the ability to do so.

== Sunder ==

    Sunder allows the user to attempt to destroy the weapons or equipment of an
    enemy character. To use this ability, use the #sunder extended command.
    Use the #sunder command to sunder.

== Tumble ==

    Tumble allows the user to switch places with an opponent, and is useful for
    getting out of dangerous situations. Note that tumbling costs at least one
    turn, however.
    Use the #tumble command to tumble.

== Wild magic ==

This is specific to [[Cartomancer]]s, [[Tourist]]s and [[Wizard]]s.

    Wild magic is a random and potentially dangerous skill. Any time you cast a spell,
    there is a chance that you will cast a completely random spell instead, even if
    that spell is not one normally on your list of known spells. When a spell is cast
    randomly, its level is increased.
    Additional levels in wild magic increase the chance of wild magic occurring.

This template calculates and displays the average of ''n<sub>1</sub>''d''y<sub>1</sub>''+''n<sub>2</sub>''d''y<sub>2</sub>''+''n<sub>3</sub>''d''y<sub>3</sub>''+''bonus''.  The exact [[d notation]] is shown in the hover text unless the <code>hover</code> parameter is <code>false</code>.  All parameters are optional and default to 0.  The <code>bonus</code> parameter may take a simple mathematical expression, which may be useful for explicitly showing multiple bonuses in the hover text.

Usage:

<nowiki>{{davg|n1|y1|n2|y2|n3|y3|bonus=|hover=}}</nowiki>

Examples:

1d4 is an average of {{davg|1|4|hover=false}}.

[[Vorpal Blade]] does {{davg|1|12|bonus=1}} average damage against large monsters, or {{davg|1|12|bonus=1+7}} when enchanted to +7.

A +7 [[Tsurugi of Muramasa]] does {{davg|1|8|2|6|1|8|bonus=7}} average damage against large monsters.
