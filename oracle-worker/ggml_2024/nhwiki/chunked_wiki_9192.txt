If Lamashtu is awake, you probably won't be able to kill her, and will have to strand her somewhere else. You can often get her adjacent to her, branchport away, then step back and cursed gain level or levelport away from her to strand her there. Make sure she's not adjacent when you're trying to ditch her. Be careful of stranding her in Sokoban. It's probably a pretty good place to fight her due to the small size, but you won't be able to teleport away from her in a pinch. Levelporting and cursed gain level (then waiting for your branchport artifact to recharge) will still work fine there.

If you still intend on trying to kill her.
* Don't bother too much about armor&mdash;you'll just lose it. Instead, go for maximum [[protection]] and try to make sure you still have all possible resistances without armor. Also pay attention to your sources of free action and speed. If you don't have sources of both of those aside from your armor, you might as well give up now. 
* Curse your weapon and any rings &mdash;that will stop them from falling off in the filth. 
* If your source of damage isn't a melee weapon, you should seriously reconsider. It may seem like spells or projectiles are good since you don't have to face Lamashtu's melee attacks, but you'll likely spend a lot of the fight stunned or confused due to her spells, or possibly the attacks of her summons. If the RNG really doesn't like you, she'll even summon an uvuudaum just to make sure you really stay confused. Confusion will block your spells, and limits multishot from most launchers to 1, so there goes your damage.
* Try to get as high of a max health pool as possible. 500+ is recommended. 
* A stack of potions of full healing, individually named, is a good idea&minus;this minimizes the chance of losing them all to dilution from filth and exposure from acid; full healing will clear illness, hallucination, and confusion. Your unicorn horn is likely to get cursed very quickly.
* You can't teleport on Lamashtu's level itself, so a good strategy is to aggro her and branchport to somewhere like the Mines to actually fight her. Levelporting one level up and descending to fight Lamashtu on her own upstairs also works, but you won't be able to teleport back if you get thrown off the stairs somehow (abduction attacks will do that to you).
* You'll need multiple escape items handy. Cursed teleportation, cursed gain level, and the Silver Key are all good options, but note that all of them will drag an adjacent Lamashtu along for the ride, and all of them are susceptible to being either blanked, stolen, or both. Bring a backup or two. Note that you don't need too many, since it's much more likely you'll die or get stunlocked than you'll have the chance to use them regardless. 
* A stethoscope to track damage on Lamashtu can be helpful, but not really required. 
* A source of time stop can be invaluable. The Garnet Rod or wages of sloth are both helpful.
* On-hand potions of sleeping or restore ability, or a couple effigies, might be good ideas as well. Lamashtu along with a lot of her summons can torpedo your sanity and cause you to spend a lot of the fight panicking, or possibly incapacitated due to your preexisting madnesses. 
* Lamashtu is a clerical spellcaster. Misotheistic pyramids block clerical spellcasting temporarily. Make of that what you will.
* A space may contain both a scroll of scare monster and a ward, so having both on your square can be a good idea. But be wary - priestly spellcasters can cast the [[fire pillar|flame strike]] monster spell, which destroys flammable items at your feet, like scrolls of scare monster.
* Finally, remember that Lamashtu's level has multiple drawbridges right outside her inner keep. If you're feeling particularly brave, there's always luring her into standing there and zapping striking. A source of time stop to get situated may help for this.

'''Legion devils''' are the soldiery of Hell in [[dNetHack]], found in large numbers in [[Gehennom]], particularly in the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches#Hell|lairs of the Lords of the Nine]]. Though they are certainly not harmless, most characters can cut down anything short of a captain without really noticing it's there. Legion devils are guaranteed a wand, with captains being guaranteed two, with equal probability for any type. Prior to dNetHack 3.8.0, this could include a [[wand of wishing]], making said wands far more common than usual.

The '''aoa''' is an [[amorphous]] [[monster]] in [[dNetHack]]. A smaller and weaker version, the '''aoa droplet''', also exists. 

Both the full-sized aoa and droplet have a [[Disenchanter|disenchanting]] touch and [[passive attack]]. However, adequately prepared adventurers may find them useful because their corpses are considered [[vegan]] and can be eaten for a possible increase in [[Power|spellcasting power]].

The aoa is a highly reflective sphere of pure magic. Eating an aoa corpse or a tin of aoa ''may'' increase the character's current energy by 10, or set their current energy to their maximum energy minus 40, whichever is greater. The character then gains a further 6d10 energy. If the character would gain more energy than their maximum, their maximum energy is increased by 10. If the character has {{frac|2|3}} or less of their energy remaining, these effects are guaranteed; otherwise there is a 33% chance that nothing occurs.

'''Naiads''' are a type of [[nymph]] in [[dNetHack]].

Naiads have the same appearance as a [[water nymph]] in regular [[NetHack]], but are slightly stronger than vanilla nymphs (and the dNetHack [[dryad]], which is roughly equivalent to a vanilla nymph). They also have a tendency to "collapse into a puddle of water" when badly wounded by an attack, dying immediately, but [[wet]]ting and potentially [[rust]]ing any weapon used to make the attack.

A '''swamp nymph''' is a type of [[undead]] [[monster]] that appears in [[dNetHack]]. It is the most powerful type of [[nymph (monster class)|nymph]] that most players will encounter randomly - stronger monsters in the class only appear to specific roles. Swamp nymphs are part-[[Plant (dNetHack)|plant]], and like many nymphs they are [[Fey (dNetHack)|fey creatures]].

Swamp nymphs [[Monster spell|cast spells]] in addition to stealing items, and sometimes retaliate by "collapsing into a noxious fluid" when badly wounded in melee. This kills the the swamp nymph immediately, but will inflict [[disease]] on the attacker.

==Generation==
Swamp nymphs are only randomly generated in [[Gehennom]], though they may appear in the courts of a [[Special room (dNetHack)#Throne room (throne occupied)|throne room]] ruled by a [[vampire lord]] or [[drow matron]].

At least one swamp nymph is guaranteed to appear in the lair of [[Zuggtmoy]], and two swamp nymphs named Surrarr and Nueate appear within rooms on each side of [[Mammon]]'s throne room in Minauros. Tn one variation each of the lairs of [[Malcanthet]] and [[Graz'zt]], the random nymphs that can generate upon their creation are always swamp nymphs due to generation rules.

==Strategy==
Swamp nymphs are the most difficult regular enemy in their monster class by far, especially if one manages to steal your source of [[magic resistance]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
As a forest pathogen, a fungus can be very destructive. 
Its high destructiveness comes from the fact that, unlike

The '''heaven piercer''', {{red|p}}, is a type of [[piercer]] that appears in [[dNetHack]].

Eating a heaven piercer corpse will temporarily grant [[fire resistance]].

==Generation==
Heaven piercers only generate in [[Gehennom]].

==Strategy==
Heaven piercers are much stronger and faster than glass piercers, and have [[cold resistance]] unlike most other monsters in Gehennom. Their bite attack can also stun the player. However, they are still somewhat slow and not likely to be much of a challenge by the time you encounter them.

'''Mirkwood elders''' are ancient, blood-sucking spiders. Their vampiric bite attack drains a level on 1 out of every 3 successful attacks, regardless of [[magic cancellation]].

Mirkwood elders also spread webbing with their attacks, potentially preventing you from retreating.

Mirkwood spiders and Mirkwood elders share the same entry:

{{encyclopedia|
Old fat spider spinning in a tree!
Old fat spider can’t see me!
 Attercop! Attercop!
   Won't you stop,
Stop your spinning and look for me!

Old Tomnoddy, all big body,
Old Tomnoddy can’t spy me!
 Attercop! Attercop!
  Down you drop!
You'll never catch me up your tree!

Lazy Lob and crazy Cob
are weaving webs to wind me.
I am far more sweet than other meat,
but still they cannot find me!

Here am I, naughty little fly;
you are fat and lazy.
You cannot trap me, though you try,
in your cobwebs crazy.

'''Metroids''' are a group of monsters in [[dNetHack]]. They belong to the [[trapper or lurker above]] [[monster class]], which has been renamed the ''trapper, lurker, or metroid'' class. 

All forms of metroid except the baby metroid have [[life drain]] attacks of varying potency, in addition to other [[Physical damage|physical]] and elemental ([[acid]]ic, [[shock]]ing) attacks. 

[[Wand of death|Death rays]] will not kill metroids (except baby metroids). Instead, the energy will stimulate the metroid to bud or divide, creating one or more new metroids or baby metroids, depending on the development stage of the parent metroid.

'''Baby metroids''' are the weakest form of metroid, and are not normally generated.  Metroid [[eggs]] hatch into baby metroids.  If a metroid egg hatches in your inventory, the resulting baby metroid will always be tame.

Baby metroids are too young to divide, and will therefore die if zapped with a [[wand of death]].  They also do not have a life-draining bite.
