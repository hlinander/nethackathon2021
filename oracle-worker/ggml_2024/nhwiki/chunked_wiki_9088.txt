==The Chambers of Deception==
The portal leads out into a set of seven 3x3 chambers, with a hidden set of doors leading to a pair of corridors. Each chamber has a different "challenge" theme - while some may contain potentially valuable items (such as [[Dragon (SLASH'EM)|dragon]] [[corpses]]), many of them also contain monsters and other objects designed to merely resemble useful items. The portal will always place you in the Chamber of Sloth; the other chambers are randomly arranged within the layout shown above.

===The Chamber of Sloth===
On the square with the portal (marked 'x') is an engraving reading "Beware of Dreams come true!" The room contains a hostile [[imp]], and four spaces next to the portal (marked with '^' symbols) each have a 60% chance of containing a [[sleeping gas trap]]. There are also sleeping gas traps scattered throughout the rest of the floor, making it likely that you will always have to cross them to enter or leave some of the other chambers.

[[Sleep resistance]] is an ideal method to handle these traps: player [[Vampire (starting race)|Vampire]]s start with the resistance, as do all [[Monk]]s, and player [[Elf (starting race)|elves]] gain it at [[experience level]] 4. In [[SlashTHEM]], player [[Ghoul (starting race)|Ghoul]]s also start with sleep resistance, as well as [[Bard]]s and [[Geek]]s.<!--May be Hackers instead - Geek and Hacker got pretty rough make overs in the code, so pending a confirmation of that...-->

[[Polymorph control|Controlled]] [[polymorph]] into a sleep-resistant or [[breathless]] creature can also suffice - [[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppelgangers]] can polymorph at will and should have reliable access to some applicable monster forms by the time they find the Lawful Quest; they gain polymorph control at experience level 9 in SLASH'EM, and at 25 in SlashTHEM. You can also obtain intrinsic sleep resistance from [[#The Chamber of Dragon Meat|The Chamber of Dragon Meat]], though see that section for why this may prove difficult.

If you have non-sleep resistant pets you cannot guide through with a [[magic whistle]], or you have no resistance and do not want to rely on hoping you have enough [[hit point]]s and AC, you can destroy the doors in order to move diagonally around the traps - note that [[kick]]ing them down, or else using a [[force bolt]] or [[wand of striking]], will almost certainly wake the [[sleep]]ing monsters in the other chambers. You can also remove the traps by digging a [[pit]] on their squares and filling them with [[boulder]]s, or else use [[levitation]] to bypass them.

===The Chamber of Greed===
This room contains one to three [[large pile of killer coins|large piles of killer coins]], and may also include up to three [[pile of killer coins|piles of killer coins]] and up to three [[huge pile of killer coins|huge piles of killer coins]], as well as up to three [[Worthless glass|worthless pieces of white glass]]. New players may not have encountered killer coins before; be warned that they can dish out significant amounts of damage, although a sufficiently armed and armored player should be able to defeat them easily. [[Elbereth]] will work in a pinch.

===The Chamber of Gluttony===
This room contains one to five [[killer food ration]]s and a [[giant louse]] [[egg]]; it may also include a [[killer tripe ration]] (80% chance), up to three [[bad egg]]s, a 40% chance [[giant flea]] egg, 20% chance of a [[cursed]] [[mushroom]], 50% chance of a [[tin]] of [[asphynx]] meat, and a 50% chance of a tin of [[green slime]] meat. Like the killer coins, the killer food rations and killer tripe rations can quickly cut down an unprepared dungeoneer. The giant flea and giant louse can make good sacrifice fodder if they hatch hostile, as they will randomly multiply. 

===The Chamber of Junk===
This chamber is filled with anywhere from two to nine random {{white|@}} monsters: at least two and up to five of them may generate as hostile and awake, up to three are generated peaceful; one may be generated asleep, and will be  hostile or peaceful as normal depending on your race. Beware if any of the hostile {{white|@}} are [[Werecreature (SLASH'EM)|werecreatures]] or even a [[gypsy]] - the latter is quite dangerous even if you are high level, as they can cast [[summon nasties]], [[touch of death]] and [[curse items]], and can also steal [[intrinsic]]s like [[gremlin]]s.

The room may contain any of the following "treasure", with a 40% probability of each unless otherwise noted:

*two cursed [[potion of sickness|potions of sickness]]
*a cursed [[potion of sleeping]]
*a cursed [[potion of confusion]]
*a cursed [[potion of hallucination]]
*a cursed [[potion of blindness]]
*two cursed [[potion of polymorph|potions of polymorph]]
*a cursed [[potion of acid]]
*a cursed [[potion of paralysis]]
*a cursed [[wand of draining]]
*a cursed [[wand of opening]] with 0 charges (60% chance)
*a cursed [[wand of nothing]] with 0 charges (80% chance)
*a cursed [[wand of secret door detection]] with 0 charges (60% chance)
*a cursed -2 pair of [[fumble boots]]
*a cursed -4 pair of [[gauntlets of fumbling]]
*a cursed -1 [[poisonous cloak]]
*a cursed +0 [[robe of weakness]]
*a cursed -2 [[fly swatter]] named Bugshmasher (sic)
*a cursed -4 [[worm tooth]] named Storm Brand
*a cursed -3 [[short sword]] named Chaosbane
*a cursed [[amulet of strangulation]] named life saving
*a cursed [[ring of sleeping]] named slow digestion
*a cursed [[ring of hunger]] named free action
*a blessed -9 [[ring of increase accuracy]] named polymorph control
*a cursed [[oil lamp]]

While these items are dangerous for a completely unwary player to randomly use, many of these items also have useful application outside of their "gotcha" qualities - some of the other items can be [[charge]]d and uncursed, or in some cases even [[cancelled]], in order to be made useful. Many players that make it to the Lawful Quest should not only catch on to the ruse, but also have at least a few of the listed items identified.

===The Chamber of Dragon Meat===
<!--Feels more like a "Chamber of Waste" thematically, and the .des file hints as much-->
This chamber contains one dragon corpse of every type available in SLASH'EM except [[silver dragon|silver]], along with a [[tinning kit]], six to eight [[maggot]]s and a 50% chance of a [[carrion crawler]]; the corpses generated are unchanged in SlashTHEM. While this looks like a great opportunity to get any missing [[intrinsic]]s, there is naturally a catch as well - just one corpse alone will render you [[satiated]], and the others will likely rot away before you can get to them unless you are interrupted eating that first one; the tinning kit provided is also cursed and has 0 charges.

The best way to get the most out of the corpses is to either bring your own tinning kit, or else be able to uncurse and charge the one provided. If you are only concerned about specific intrinsics or else cannot tin all the corpses, being [[breathless]] or casting spells may allow you to become unsatiated and possibly eat several.

===The Snake Pit===
This chamber contains a [[spiked pit]], two to four random S, and one or two random s. There may also be a [[king cobra]] and up to two [[pit viper]]s, with a 90% probability of each.

===The False Temple===
This chamber contains a coaligned [[altar]] and peaceful [[aligned priest]]. However, the room is '''''not''''' a [[temple]]: the priest is not tending to the altar and will instead wander randomly about the level. [[Chat]]ting will make the priest hostile, and killing them is considered [[murder]] for non-chaotic characters.

The altar itself can be used normally, and is one of two guaranteed altars that is coaligned or can be made coaligned safely; the other can be found in the [[Temple of Moloch]]. This is important for SLASH'EM players who do not want to risk angering the [[Minetown]] priest by converting that altar, as they are the only guaranteed source for buying [[protection]] since the variant also makes the priest in the [[Valley of the Dead]] hostile.

===The Boulder Path===
A secret set of doors in the chamber on the upper right leads to a corridor with a boulder at the '`' mark and [[rolling boulder trap]]s at each of the '^' marks. Each of the two spaces marked 'G' in the corridor has a 60% chance of a hostile [[ghost]]. The one-tile room at the end of the corridor contains a cursed [[runesword]] and an uncursed [[wand of striking]] with two charges - there is a ~5% chance that it will be [[Stormbringer]], and since runeswords are not randomly generated, this is the only way to find Stormbringer outside [[bones]].

==The Maze==
One of the chambers has a hidden corridor that leads into the maze to the right. The maze is randomly generated and the walls are made of [[solid rock]], which has the same appearance as a darkened area, so you will not "remember" the shape of the maze automatically unless you permanently light up the corridors (using the {{spell of|light}} spell, a [[wand of light]], [[scroll of light|scrolls of light]], or the [[Holy Spear of Light]]). Each of the spaces marked 'w' in the maze has a 60% chance of having a [[rot worm]] generated on it, and each of the two spaces in the upper left and lower right has a 50% chance of a [[shade]].

The swamp in the center contains a [[statue trap]] of an [[arch-lich]] (!) and a cursed -9 set of [[Gray dragon|gray]] [[dragon scale]]s in the same space. The arch-lich is created with wands of [[wand of fireball|fireball]], [[wand of create horde|create horde]], [[wand of speed monster|speed monster]] and [[wand of make invisible|make invisible]] (the latter three all have one charge each), a [[cockatrice corpse]], and a cursed -1 pair of [[leather gloves]]. Note that the arch-lich cannot actually use the cockatrice corpse, since it lacks a weapon attack. The swamp also contains between four and six [[electric eel]]s at the spaces marked with ';'. The exit from the maze to the cloud bank is at the lower left.

You will want to have a [[unicorn horn]] or [[Immunity to sickness|sickness resistance]] in order to deal with the rot worms. Most characters would do best to avoid the electric eels and arch-lich in the middle of the maze, unless you desperately need the dragon scales for armor and have a means of [[cancellation]] (to remove the -9 penalty). Remember that electric eels not only have a [[Drowning attack|drowning attack]] that can kill you instantly (in addition to the usual defenses, in SLASH'EM this can be prevented with [[Ring of free action|free action]]), they can also break apart rings and wands if they hit you.

They are various ways of dealing with the trap without having to fight the [[arch-lich]]:

*Zap the statue with a [[wand of teleportation]], and then find the loot with a blessed [[potion of object detection]]. This can be done from outside the swamp, and is probably the easiest and safest method.
*Pull the arch-lich statue towards you with a [[fishing pole]].
*[[Scroll of genocide|Genocide]] arch-liches (or L if you have a blessed scroll).
*Throw a statue of a weaker monster onto the square before stepping on it.
*Have a super-strong pet such as an [[Archon]], [[Planetar]], or [[Solar]] fight the arch-lich.
*Lure a monster to pick up the dragon scale mail. It will not set off the trap. A cursed [[figurine]] (for example an [[orc]]) and [[Elbereth]] can be handy here. Most pets can't do this, as they will try to pick up the arch-lich statue before anything else in the stack, and few monsters smaller than [[giant]]s will be able to lift it. Pets will also be reluctant to step over the cursed dragon scales and will not pick them up until the scales have been uncursed.

Bad ideas:

*Even at expert, the [[grappling hook]] has a chance of pulling you to the statue, instead of pulling the statue.
*A wand of polymorph will not trigger the trap, but it will polymorph the dragon scales, possibly destroying them in the process.
*Using a [[wand of striking]] or the spell of [[force bolt]] will trigger the trap instead of crumbling the statue.

==The Cloud Bank==
The maze leads out south of the chambers and into a bank of [[cloud]]s with a river of [[lava]] running through and an isolated "island" room in the middle - the exit from the cloud bank to Nightmare's forest is at the lower left. Within the clouds are one or two [[elemental]]s of each type, including one or two [[stalker]]s, as well as up to four other random E; on level creation, they will be generated at the locations marked above. A [[gremlin]] named Clown is generated at the position marked 'g'. There is an 80% chance of a [[ring of fire resistance]] being generated at the end of the lava river's branches - but only one of the possible spots it can appear in is outside of the lava (marked yellow, while the spots 

The locked chamber in the middle of the cloud bank houses the "Spice Girls" - a group of up to three [[mind flayer]]s named Ginger, Victoria, and Emma - at the positions marked 'h'; only Ginger is guaranteed, and the other two have a 80% chances of existing. The chamber may also contain up to two master mind flayers named Mel B. and Mel C. at the positions marked 'M'; each has a 60% chance of being generated. If either monster species is genocided, the missing monsters will be replaced by random ones with the same names. A fountain and a chest sit at the center, with the chest containing a [[wand of cold]] with 16 charges - the chest may also contain an [[amulet of flying]] (70% chance) and a [[wand of digging]] (80% chance). 

For a moderately tough player, it may be worth going after the Spice Girls' treasure, especially if you plan to cross the lava river and/or hunt down the ring of fire resistance. Speed, powerful ranged attacks and a greased helm are among your best tools to have - remember that in SLASH'EM and SlashTHEM, a [[ring of free action]] or another source of the property will protect you from brain-sucking attacks. If you already have a means to cross (e.g., [[flying]], [[levitation]], [[fireproof]] [[water walking boots]], etc.), then you may opt to skip them unless you desire [[telepathy]] and/or a chance to boost [[intelligence]].

==Nightmare's Forest==
[[Nightmare]], the main monster of the quest, is located on the throne in the forest on the far left, along with four to eight [[pixie]]s, two to four [[quickling]]s, a [[unicorn]] of each color (the only place where you will meet a hostile unicorn of your own color), a [[wood nymph]], and a [[brownie]]. Killing Nightmare will generate the [[Key of Law]] and the artifact unicorn horn [[Nighthorn]] (unless you petrify or disintegrate Nightmare, then only the Key of Law will be dropped). The Lawful Quest also contains eight to sixteen [[black light]]s, four to eight [[shadow]]s, eight to twelve [[sleeping gas trap|sleep gas traps]], two to four [[anti-magic trap]]s, and the engravings "You can feel eyes on your back." and "I can see you..."; all at random positions.

The 'n's will be generated sleeping, and the player is advised not to disturb them as they may steal important items and become hard to kill. You will probably want to have [[telepathy]] or [[see invisible|some way of seeing invisible creatures]] to get through this section. It is also best to avoid killing your co-aligned unicorn to avoid the alignment penalty.  Throwing an un-ID'd [[gem]] at it will always pacify it. 

Nightmare does a surprising amount of damage, but respects [[Elbereth]] and can otherwise be dealt with as any fast monster. 

Remember that [[Nighthorn]] and the [[Key of Law]] will both [[Artifact blast|blast]] non-lawfuls, and Nighthorn will be generated cursed, so it is advised not to wield it until you have [[Curse removal|uncursed]] it.

==Spooky messages==

The Lawful Quest is the only level in the game to have the 'spooky' flag, and hence the following messages are printed randomly while you're on the level:

 You hear screaming in the distance!
 You hear a faint whisper: "Please leave your measurements for your custom-made coffin."
 You hear a door creak ominously.
 You hear hard breathing just a few steps behind you!
 You hear dragging footsteps coming closer!
 You hear anguished moaning and groaning coming out of the walls!
 You hear mad giggling directly behind you!
 You smell rotting corpses.
 You smell chloroform!
 You feel ice cold fingers stroking your neck.
 You feel a ghostly touch caressing your face.
 You feel somebody dancing on your grave.
 You feel something breathing down your neck.
 You feel as if the walls were closing in on you.
 You just stepped on something squishy.

These messages only appear when you're hallucinating:
 You hear a strong voice pronouncing: "There can only be one!"
 You hear a voice booming all around you: "Warning: self-destruction sequence activated!"
 You smell your mother-in-law's cooking!
 You smell horse dung.
 You hear someone shouting: "Who ordered the burger?"
 You can faintly hear the Twilight Zone theme.
 You hear an outraged customer complaining: "I'll be back!"
 You hear someone praising your valor!
 You hear someone singing: "Jingle bells, jingle bells..."

==Variants==
===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], be prepared with scare monster scrolls for the mind flayer room, because you can't engrave on the floor of the cloud bank any more. 

With all of the new monsters that have been added, corpses that grant [[intrinsic]]s like [[telepathy]] and the various [[resistance]]s are harder to find, so the guaranteed mind flayers and dragon corpses in this area are even more valuable than in [[SLASH'EM]]. Sleep and disintegration resistance are also more important to have, because of new monsters that use these attacks. More care will be needed to keep all of the corpses you need. It may be a good idea to look for a charged tinning kit, a source of charging for the guaranteed spent tinning kit, or even an [[icebox]], before you embark on this quest. Avoid trying to eat the corpses whole, because of the risk of [[choking]], and the chance that the others will rot away before you can get to them.

If you are desperate about the cursed dragon scale mails, here it's a bit easier to obtain them.

The '''#untrap''' [[extended command]] will attempt to disable an adjacent [[trap]] if it can be disabled. This has a special interaction with [[pit]]s, [[bear trap]]s and [[spider web]]s, as it will instead attempt to help out any [[monster]] trapped in one, which may result in said monsters becoming [[peaceful]]. It is a good idea to untrap your [[pet]] should it fall victim to a [[beartrap]] or other trap. [[Lawful]] characters occasionally get a +1 alignment bonus for helping monsters out of a trap ("You feel that you did the right thing.") Attempting to help a [[footrice]] this way without wearing gloves will cause you to be [[petrified]]. When attempting to #untrap a [[squeaky board]], the player will be asked for an [[item]] to [[apply]], for which the intended response is a [[potion of oil]] or a [[can of grease]] with charges.  Successfully untrapping a [[land mine]] or bear trap will recover a trap object that can later be applied by the player.  Untrapping an [[arrow trap]] or [[dart trap]] will recover the appropriate type of projectiles. Many traps cannot be disarmed directly with this command; instead, it often suffices to dig a pit to replace it (if there is not already one there) and fill the pit.

== Restrictions ==

You cannot untrap anything if you cannot reach the floor. You cannot untrap any trap if you are trapped in this or another trap, or if there is a monster on the square which is not trapped, or if the trap is hidden by a boulder, etc.

== Types ==

You can untrap containers, and following types of traps:

* Spider web or bear trap. If there is a monster in it, you try to save it from the trap, otherwise you try to remove the trap. In case of success with bear trap, you receive [[bear trap]] as a tool.
* Pit or spiked pit. If there is a monster in it, you try to untrap it, otherwise nothing happens. ("You are already on the edge of the pit", or "Try filling the pit first.")
* Landmine. In case of success, you receive [[landmine]] as a tool.
* Squeaky board. You are asked for an object to untrap it with. The object must be either noncursed, nonlit [[potion of oil]], or noncursed [[can of grease]] with charges. In case of success, one potion of oil, or one charge of the can, is spent, the potion of oil becomes known (if you used it), and the trap is removed. "You repair the squeaky board."
* Dart trap or arrow trap. In case of success, 50-rnl(50) darts or arrows are recovered.

Other kinds of traps cannot be untrapped. ("You cannot disable this/that trap.") However, there are alternative methods to remove most of them.

== Probability and effects of failure ==

The base chance of disarming most traps is 1 in 3.{{reffunc|trap.c|untrap_prob}} The full algorithm is:
* Set ''difficulty'' to 3.
* If it is a [[spider web]], and not yours, increase to 30.
* Add 1 if you are confused, hallucinating, or both.
* Add 1 if you are blind.
* Add 2 if you are stunned.
* Double the ''difficulty'' if you are fumbling.
* Subtract 1 for each of the following (if ''difficulty'' drops to 1, there are no further subtractions):
** It is your own trap.
** You are a high-level rogue (1 is subtracted with probability [[XL]]/60).
** You are a rogue carrying your quest artifact, [[The Master Key of Thievery]].
** You are a ranger.

With probability of 1 in ''difficulty'', you succeed.
Otherwise, if [[rnl]](5) = 0, you only get a message "This/That/Your (trap) is difficult to disarm/remove".{{refsrc|src/trap.c|3972|nethack=3.6.1}}

If [[rnl]](5) > 0, however, bad things happen:
* If you tried to untrap a monster from bear trap, the monster is abused, loses hit points, and may die.
* If you tried to untrap a monster from spider web, the web stretches to your square, and you become trapped in it.
* If the trap is under you, it hits you.
* If the trap is not under you, and there is no monster in it, you move into the trap.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Rangers always disarm bear traps if ''difficulty'' is at most 3. ({{commit|e4cb3f083251cce903a6a6a80c607aba9f67db4f}})}}

== Other information ==

Attempting to #untrap a door will cause you to search the door for traps, after which you will be asked if you want to attempt to disarm it.

The command can also be used to detect or remove a [[container trap]].

If the [[number_pad]]-option is on, you can press {{kbd|u}} to untrap.

&&%s&& %s Bare hands {126736 2019-08-05T00:27:16Z {4001313 Ardub23} Punctuation fix (note that "samurai's" is already correct, since "samurai" is also the plural) The '''bare hands''' [[skill]] is used when attacking while wielding nothing. Every class has this skill, except [[Monk]]s and [[Samurai]], who instead possess the superior [[martial arts]] skill. The strategy information may not apply to monks, who can be powerful fighters even in the absence of a weapon.

Bare hands do 1d2 base damage to both [[small]] and [[large]] monsters. Both [[basic]] and [[skilled]] yield +1 to damage on 50% of all hits,<ref>Bare-hands or martial arts skill only grant their damage bonus if the d2 or d4 base damage is at least 2. See {{sourcecode|uhitm.c|546}} and {{sourcecode|uhitm.c|603}}</ref> [[expert]] and [[master]] gives a 50% chance each hit of a +2 bonus to [[damage]]. Monks' and samurai's [[martial arts]] skill does 1d4 damage, with much greater bonuses for skills on 75% of all hits.

In 3.4.3, there was no [[to-hit]] bonus for this skill at all,<ref>The bonus would be added by {{function|weapon.c|weapon_hit_bonus}}, but this is never called because {{sourcecode|uhitm.c|283}} or {{sourcecode|uhitm.c|1957}} checks if you're wielding something.</ref> but there is a bonus in 3.6.0.

Attacking with bare hands causes [[silver damage]] if you are wearing a silver ring and no gloves, similar to wielding any silver object.  Attacking with bare hands if you have at least basic skill has a small chance of causing a [[staggering blow]] under some conditions, which stuns the opponent and moves it backwards.

==Strategy==
While a desperate player may need to attack with bare hands from time to time, the need is so rare and the benefit so marginal that this skill should never be enhanced by most characters. Carrying some form of [[ranged attack]] will greatly reduce your need to resort to bare hands.

Bare-handed damage is so poor that only a martial artist should bother going for the silver damage from a worn ring.

Bare-handed attacks do not break the [[never hit with a wielded weapon]] [[conduct]], but neither do attacks from wielded non-weapon items.

==Average damage==
Since the damage bonus is only applied to 50% of hits, the average damage is not 1.5 + ''bonus'', but 1.5 + 0.5*''bonus''. This makes the +2 bonus for Expert/Master skill even more pitiful, especially considering the 4 skill slots and 360 hits required.

In [[SLASH'EM]], the [[Drow]] can put enemies to sleep by attacking with bare hands.

&&%s&& %s Djinn {18493 2007-01-24T00:42:11Z {560 Mogri} [[Djinn]] moved to [[Djinni]]: ...but NetHack calls it "djinni" anyway. Whoops. #REDIRECT [[Djinni]]}
&&%s&& %s Wood {149395 2022-12-15T19:01:51Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* EvilHack */ hmm '''Wood''' is a kind of [[material]] for items that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

Wooden objects are subject to [[erosion|burn]]ing and [[rotting]]; for wooden weapons, they can be burnt by dropping them in [[lava]] or using them to strike a [[monster]] with a [[fire]]-based [[passive attack]] {{frac|2|3}} of the time. [[Elven item|Elven weapons]] and several pieces of elven armor are among the many items made of wood.

Wood golems are constructs made of wood, and are vulnerable to rotting - being hit by a rotting attack will cause them to [[instadeath|fall to pieces]], and a player in wood golem form will be reverted to their normal form, even if they have [[unchanging]]. Polypiling enough items made of wood will create a [[wood golem]].

[[Gelatinous cube]]s will engulf and eat any wooden items they come across; polymorphing into a gelatinous cube will also allow you to eat wooden items. 

==List of wooden items==
The following items are made of wood:

* Elven items
** [[Elven dagger]]s
*** [[Sting]], an [[artifact]] elven dagger
** [[Elven short sword]]s
** [[Elven broadsword]]s
*** [[Orcrist]], an artifact elven broadsword
** [[Elven bow]]s
** [[Elven arrow]]s
** [[Elven spear]]s
** [[Elven shield]]s
* [[Club]]s
* [[Quarterstaves]]
** [[The Staff of Aesculapius]], an artifact quarterstaff
* [[Bow]]s, including [[orcish bow]]s and [[yumi]]
** The [[Longbow of Diana]], an artifact bow
* [[Crossbow]]s
* [[Boomerang]]s
* [[Small shield]]s
* [[Flute]]s and [[harp]]s
* [[Chest]]s and [[large box]]es
* [[Wand]]s with the [[randomized appearance]] of oak, balsa, ebony, maple, pine, or forked
* [[Ring]]s with the "wooden" randomized appearance

==Strategy==
Wooden weapons (particularly elven ones) are favored by some players for their immunity to rusting, though they will need to take care when using such weapons against monsters with fiery passive attacks, such as [[fire elemental]]s.

[[Polyself]] into a gelatinous cube allows you to eat wooden items, which in practice can be very occasionally useful for [[eating jewelry|eating wooden rings]] to gain otherwise unobtainable [[intrinsic]]s.

==Origin==
The use of wood in elven weapons and shields suggest that they may be made of (or at least inspired by) [[D&D]]'s [http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ironwood ironwood].

==Variants==
Some variants add new items made of wood, and variants that implement an [[object materials]] system also make it possible for certain items with hard base materials to be made of wood.

===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] adds the following wooden items:

* [[Baseball bat]]
** [[Bat from Hell]], an artifact baseball bat
* [[Dark elven bow]]
** [[Plague]], an artifact dark elven bow
* [[Dark elven arrow]]
* [[Dark elven short sword]]
* [[Skullcrusher]], an artifact club
* [[Quick Blade]], an artifact elven short sword
* [[Torch]]
* [[Wooden stake]]
** [[The Stake of Van Helsing]], an artifact wooden stake
* [[Defunct features (SLASH'EM)|Defunct objects]]:
** [[The Staff of Withering]], an artifact quarterstaff
** [[The Tentacle Staff]], an artifact quarterstaff

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], wooden weapons are of somewhat increased importance due to the inclusion of [[staves]]: a type of magical [[ward]] that is carved into wooden items, and can be learned from some [[spellbook]]s and wooden weapons. Staves are used by carving them into a wooden weapon with any weapon that uses the [[knife]] or [[dagger]] [[skill]]s, then dropping that wooden weapon at your feet; some staves grant special effects when the weapon they are carved on is wielded. If you choose to re-carve a weapon that already has a stave, you will chip off the existing stave before carving the new one, damaging the carved weapon and adding a turn to the time required to carve the stave. Dwarves start the game with knowledge of all wards, and are always given a [[knife]] for carving and a [[club]] to carve into.

dNetHack also adds the following wooden items:

* [[Atlatl]]
* Elven items:
** [[Elven mace]]
** [[Elven sickle]]
** [[Elven lance]]
* [[Macuahuitl]]
* [[The Rogue Gear-Spirits]], an artifact crossbow
* [[Shadowlander's torch]]

[[Elven helm]]s and [[elven boots]] are now made of wood instead of leather.

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], the [[Big Stick]], which is the new [[Caveman]] [[quest artifact]], is made of wood.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], many objects with a hard base material can be made of wood. As a material, wood has a −1 damage penalty for bladed weapons, and wooden armor offers one less AC point compared to their iron equivalents; however, wooden equipment is much cheaper and more than twice as light as their iron counterparts. Wooden [[helm]]s are sufficiently rigid enough to offer metal-like protection against falling objects.

xNetHack also uses the Big Stick from Fourk as the Caveman quest artifact, with the Sceptre of Might serving as the [[Priest]] quest artifact instead.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], wood functions similarly to xNetHack, with wooden slashing weapons taking a -1 penalty to damage and wooden armor offering 1 less AC compared to iron armor.

EvilHack adds the following items with a base material of wood:

* [[Atlatl]]
** [[Xiuhcoatl]], an artifact atlatl
* [[Elven long sword]]
* [[Staff of divination]]
* [[Staff of healing]]
* [[Staff of escape]]

80% of items with a default base material of wood will retain that material when generated - the rest of them have different materials based on the following distribution:

* 8% stone
* 4% iron
* 2% each bone, steel or mithril
* 1% each silver or copper

70% of regular bows and 5% of [[horn]]s will be made of wood, as are 5% of items with an [[iron]] or [[steel]] base material that are not of dwarvish or orcish make. Non-cloth elven armor and weapons have an 80% chance to be wooden if their base material is wood, and a 20% chance otherwise.

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, SlashTHEM adds the following wooden items:

* [[Mallet]]
** [[Tenderizer]], an artifact mallet
* [[Sharpened pencil]]
* [[The Staff of Withering]], an artifact quarterstaff that was deferred in SLASH'EM

&&%s&& %s Dragon hide {149324 2022-12-12T16:45:09Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} token history section, Evil '''Dragon hide''' (or '''dragonhide'''){{refsrc|src/decl.c|268|nethack=3.6.6}}  is a [[material]] for items that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. 

Dragon hide is the material that composes all [[dragon scale]]s and dragon scale mail, and is inherently [[fixed]].{{refsrc|src/objects.c|375|nethack=3.6.6}} While it is considered an animal product and breaks [[vegan]] conduct if eaten, it is not a sufficiently [[organic]] material that can be eaten by a [[gelatinous cube]].{{refsrc|src/eat.c|2411|nethack=3.6.6}}

Oddly, [[polypiling]] enough dragon hide objects may result in the creation of a [[straw golem]].

==History==
Dragon hide items were introduced to ''NetHack'' in [[NetHack 3.0.0]] with the addition of dragon scale mail; dragon scales first appeared in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

==Variants==
Some variants add new dragon scales and scale mail, which are made of dragon hide. Others implement an [[object materials]] system that also make it possible for certain items, usually [[leather]] or [[cloth]]-based ones, to be made of dragonhide; though dragonhide-material items are distinct from dragon-scaled armor (i.e. you will not polymorph into a dragon if wearing dragonhide versions of normal armor), the material is the same for both. Dragonhide is inherently [[fixed]] or [[erosion]]-proofed and cannot be deteriorated through normal means; as a material it is typically highly rare and expensive, and offers the most [[AC]] of non-metallic armor materials.

===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], cloth or leather items can be made of dragonhide, but do not occur randomly; they can still be [[wish]]ed for or found in [[bones]] files.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], dragonhide is also used as a "catch-all" in the code of [[objnam.c]] for special cases involving other items made of a special leather or similar material.<ref>[https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dNAO/blob/compat-3.21.4/src/objnam.c#L1441 dNetHack 3.21.4 objnam.c, line 1441 - special cases for dragonhide objects]</ref> [[Leo Nemaeus hide]] is an example of a "dragonhide" item that is flavored as being a cloak made of skin from a [[wikipedia:Nemean lion|Nemean lion]] via this special case.

Cloth or leather items can very rarely generate with a dragonhide material - there is a 1% chance that a random leather item will be made of dragonhide, and a 0.1% chance for cloth items to randomly generate as dragonhide; hard objects can be made of dragonhide as well, which is described as dragonbone (or dragon-bone). Dragonhide and dragonbone armor grants the higher bonuses to AC and defense rating among materials (usually a 60% increase compared to the base material of the object), while dragonhide and dragonbone weapons gain bonuses to piercing damage.

Many [[dNetHack artifacts]] are made out of dragonhide, dragonbone or similar material:

* [[Dragonlance]] is an [[artifact weapon]] [[lance]] made of dragon-bone.
* [[Xiuhcoatl]] is an [[artifact]] that has an [[atlatl]] and [[bullwhip]] form; the bullwhip is made of serpenthide.
* [[The Lifehunt Scythe]] is an artifact [[scythe]] made of dragon-bone.
* The [[Beastmaster's Duster]] is an artifact dragonhide [[Leather jacket|jacket]].
* [[The Platinum Dragon Plate]] is an artifact [[silver dragon scale mail]], and is made of the default dragon hide.
* [[The Chromatic Dragon Scales]] are an artifact set of [[black dragon scales]], and are made of the default dragon hide; they can also be made into dragon scale mail or a [[dragon scale shield]] like other scales.
* Of note is that [[The Steel Scales of Kurtulmak]], a set of artifact [[gray dragon scales]], are made of [[iron]] rather than dragon hide.

In addition to random generation, various monsters can generate with dragon-made objects:

* [[Neanderthals]] in the [[Caveman quest]] can be generated with dragon scale mail and scale shields, alongside other dragon-made items such as dragonbone clubs or aklyses.
* [[Eladrin]] that are summoned by [[Dracae Eladrin]] and are ''not'' [[Uiscerre Eladrin]] will generate with dragonbone [[long sword]]s.
* One of the [[lillend]] created in the lair of [[Lamashtu]] generates with a dragonbone scythe.
* Gray [[intoner]]s generate with dragonbone long swords.
* [[Occultist]]s generate with an inventory full of dragonbone items.
* [[Mammon]] will generate with dragonhide and dragonbone armor.

[[Hell vaults]] containing a [[Jrt Netjer]] may have dragonhide armor among its spoils.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], dragonhide is as rare and expensive as in other variants, and various cloth and leather items can rarely generate as made of dragonhide.

Like in many other variants, dragonhide objects usually cannot be deteriorated, with the exception of the revamped [[Destroy armor (monster spell)|destroy armor]] [[monster spell]]. The destroy armor spell can remove a piece of armor's fixed status, including the inherent fixed property of dragonhide armor, and inflict up to three levels of erosion (or one with [[magic resistance]]). Artifacts are immune to erosion in this manner.

The following artifacts are made of dragonhide:

* [[Dragonbane]] is an artifact pair of dragonhide [[Leather gloves|gloves]].
* The [[Bag of the Hesperides]] is an artifact dragonhide [[bag of holding]].

&&%s&& %s Silver {149326 2022-12-12T17:11:32Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} Un, Dyna, reorg '''Silver''' is a [[material]] for items that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

Silver is a type of [[metal]] that cannot [[erosion|corrode or rust]], and hinders [[spellcasting]] when worn as armor. Striking certain types of monsters with silver weapons will deal '''silver damage''' against them; any item made of silver is eligible for dealing damage to [[shade]]s.

Silver-hating monsters, including [[pet]]s, will not pick up silver [[weapon]]s or [[armor]]. However, they will pick up other silver [[item]]s, e.g. silver [[wand of speed monster|wands of speed monster]].

==List of silver items==
The following items are made of silver:

* [[silver saber]]s (including [[Grayswandir]] and [[Werebane]])
* [[silver arrow]]s
* [[silver dagger]]s
* [[silver spear]]s
* [[wand]]s with the [[randomized appearance]] "silver wand"
* [[ring]]s with the randomized appearance "silver ring"
* [[shield of reflection|shields of reflection]]
* [[The Bell of Opening]] (a silver [[bell]])

[[Silver dragon scales]] and [[silver dragon scale mail]] are made of [[dragon hide]], not actual silver. [[Spellbook]]s with the randomized appearance "silver spellbook" are made of [[paper]].

Silver should not be confused with [[mithril]], a different material.

==Silver damage==
Creatures vulnerable to silver are called '''silver-hating''' monsters. The following creatures are silver-hating:<ref>{{function|mondata.c|hates_silver}}</ref>

* all {{white|V}} [[vampire]]s
* {{monsymlink|shade}}s
* all [[demon|major demons]] (i.e. all {{white|&}} except [[rider]]s, [[mail daemon]]s, [[djinn]], and [[sandestin]]s)
* all {{white|i}} [[demon|minor demons]], except [[tengu]]
* all [[lycanthrope]]s

Note that with the exception of [[lycanthrope]]s, all of these are also classified as undead or demonic, and will also take an additional 1d4 from blessed weapons.

When one of these creatures is struck by a silver item, it will suffer an extra ''d20'' damage.{{refsrc|uhitm.c|558}}{{refsrc|uhitm.c|877}} This includes wielded non-weapons, or a silver ring worn while using [[bare hands|hand to hand combat]] or [[martial arts]] without gloves.

[[Silver arrow]]s deal silver damage only if shot from a [[bow]]. Wielding them, [[twoweapon]]ing two stacks, or throwing them without a [[bow]] does not deal silver damage.

Silver [[weapon]]s are one of the few things that can harm [[shade]]s. In some circumstances a makeshift silver weapon can be very valuable in [[Orcus Town]]. [[Mirror]]s do one point of damage to [[shade]]s but are not truly classified as silver. Also, the mirror will break after a single hit, so you're not likely to be able to kill the shade with it.

Unlike other damage bonuses, silver damage is not doubled by [[Grayswandir]] or [[Werebane]].

===You===
[[You]] are vulnerable to silver if you are [[polyself|polymorphed]] into one of the monsters listed above or affected by [[lycanthropy]].{{refsrc|youprop.h|368|nethack=3.6.1}} In addition to receiving extra damage from silver weapons, this makes you unable to [[wear]] or [[wield]] silver items, and interacting with them will deal 1d10 damage, similarly to an [[artifact blast]].{{refsrc|artifact.c|1904|nethack=3.6.1}}

==Strategy==
Because of the d20 damage bonus (averaging 10.5 damage), it may be a good idea to fight silver-haters even with a silver non-weapon, though then you cannot [[twoweapon]] when doing this. However, enchanted non-silver weapons are likely to be better, especially if twoweaponing - at minimum, they may prove sufficient enough that switching to [[wield]] a non-weapon is not worth the bother, except against [[shade]]s. Remember to unwield your non-weapon once you are done fighting your silver-hating target, e.g. to avoid hitting a [[disenchanter]] and draining the charges of that silver wand. If you plan to fight barehanded with a silver ring, take extra care not to accidentally strike a [[cockatrice]].

If dealing with lycanthropy frequently, whether from being bitten by werecreatures in the early game or deliberately giving yourself lycanthropy as a form of drain resistance, you will need to keep track of which items are made of silver, particularly [[wand]]s and [[rings]] - you can check your [[discoveries]] by pressing {{kbd|\}} or {{kbd|`}}.

==Variants==
Several variants implement an [[object materials]] system that allows metallic items to be made of silver. These variants also remove silver-specific weapons, since their mundane counterparts will have a silver-compatible material set; silver sabers are replaced with normal sabers.

===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] introduces several new silver items:

*[[silver long sword]]s
*[[silver mace]]s
*[[silver short sword]]s
*[[Firearm|silver bullets]]

===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], various [[wood]] and [[iron]] objects can be made of silver, including armor and weapons of elvish and dwarvish make.

===UnNetHack===
[[UnNetHack]] adds the chrome wand as a randomized appearance composesd of silver.

The limitation on wishes for magical items to the [[wand of wishing]] makes silver items more valuable as wishes - the shield of reflection is non-magical in UnNetHack, so it can be obtained from an early wish e.g. via a [[magic lamp]] to protect yourself against wands.

===DynaHack===
[[DynaHack]] adds the silver short sword from SLASH'EM.

They possess some distinct characteristics based on the quest they serve as guardian for (e.g. [[chieftain]]s have poison resistance like [[barbarian]]s).

==Description==
The quest guardians are:

When #[[chat]]ted to, quest guardians will give various quest-appropriate responses, which are listed on the appropriate role's Quest page. [[Pet]]s will not attack quest guardians unless [[confused]] or under [[conflict]]. Killing a quest guardian reduces your current [[alignment record]] to {{frac|8}}, in addition to [[murder]] penalties.{{refsrc|mon.c|1886}}

==History==
The quest guardians first appear alongside the Quest branch in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

==Messages==
{{message|That was probably a bad idea...|You killed a quest guardian and incurred a MAX/8 alignment record penalty, where MAX is your maximum alignment.}}
{{message|Whoopsie-daisy!|As above, while hallucinating.}}

==Variants==
Some variants make it so that quest guardians actively attack any and all hostile monsters that appear within the quest.

===SLASH'EM===

'''The Crown of Saint Edward''' is the [[yeoman]] quest artifact in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is a lawful [[helm of telepathy]] which also provides [[magic resistance]] and [[half spell damage]] when carried.

==Strategy==
===For yeomen===
As is true for other roles whose quest artifacts provide magic resistance, yeomen will not want to rely on the Crown as their only source of magic resistance.  Losing your only source of magic resistance to a (now magic resistant) [[Wizard of Yendor]] can be a game-ending mistake.  Most yeomen will probably want to wear the Crown, however, since the extrinsic telepathy is useful and yeomen are unlikely to be spellcasters.

===For others===
In SLASH'EM, the Crown is one of five lawful quest artifacts which provide magic resistance, the other four being [[the Orb of Detection]], [[The Magic Mirror of Merlin]] , [[the Sceptre of Might]], and [[the Stake of Van Helsing]].  A lawful player who wants to gain magic resistance from a quest artifact would certainly not wish for the Orb: the Crown provides all the same intrinsics at one third the weight (although to gain extrinsic telepathy, you must equip it in your helmet slot).  The Crown's chief benefit is that it provides half spell damage, which is useful for resisting the [[psi bolt]]s and [[curse items|item curses]] that the many new spellcasters in SLASH'EM will throw at you. The Mirror is the lightest (although not by much) and does provide slotless extrinsic telepathy, but this is definitely not as good as half spell damage.  The Sceptre is still a worthy choice with its slotless and hungerless conflict, but it has been downgraded from doing double damage against cross-aligned monsters to only doing an extra 5 damage against them.  The Stake is a fine weapon (it does a flat extra 12 damage against all monsters), but provides no extrinsics other than magic resistance.  One must thus choose which is most important: conflict (the Sceptre), a good weapon (the Stake), or half spell damage (the Crown). The Mirror would probably only be worth wishing for if you already had the Crown, just had to have extrinsic telepathy, and wanted to wear a [[helm of brilliance]] around (for spellcasting) or if you are making occasional use of a [[helm of opposite alignment]] or [[polymorph]]ed into a form that cannot wear helms (the Crown will blast you every time you put it on). 

==Origin==

The crown of Saint Edward is the actual name of the crown of the monarch of Great Britain.

{{monsym|Cthulhu}} '''Cthulhu''' (pronounced by most people as "Ka-thu-lu") is not a monster found in vanilla NetHack. In various variants, he normally appears in Moloch's Sanctum.

Cthulhu's combat power is unreal; he is more than capable of dealing 100+ damage to a character with full ascension kit equipped through melee attacks alone. In addition, he casts spells, confuses with his gaze, can eat your brain in the same manner as [[mind flayer]]s, and disintegrates into a giant [[poison cloud]] when defeated, only to rise up again in mere turns.

==[[Lethe patch]]==
In the Lethe patch, he replaces the [[high priest of Moloch]] as the guardian of the [[Amulet of Yendor]].

Cthulhu is considered a demon for game purposes; however he is not [[covetous]], and so will never teleport to meet the player. Also, unlike most monsters of similar power, he does not [[fly]] or [[levitate]]. He can follow players to other levels, however. Unlike most other {{monclasssym|&}}, he does not respect [[Elbereth]]. When killed, he does not actually die. Instead, he turns into a [[stinking cloud]], which will reform into him in only a few turns.

Although normally only seen in the Lethe patch, Cthulhu is in fact fully implemented in SLASH'EM. It is therefore quite possible to create him in wizard mode. One cannot see him in a normal game, but it is possible to wish for a statue of him. Casting [[stone to flesh]] on said statue will create a doppelganger imitating his form, with all his attacks. Killing this doppelganger before it shifts into another form (a very difficult feat, although perhaps possible with [[firearm]]s) does not do anything special, however.

A player of the Lethe patch is well-advised to kill him once, preferably from range, quickly retrieve the Amulet, and run very quickly or preferably use a cursed [[potion of gain level]]. He is vulnerable to all elemental attacks, as well as [[magic missile]]s, so spellcasters should be able to muster up the force to kill him. Fighter-types would be advised to train with a ranged weapon beforehand, or possibly to simply use firearms. The only saving grace of Cthulhu's menace is that, unlike other demon lords, he cannot teleport or fly. This should give you time to escape if necessary, and with careful planning may allow you to trap him where he cannot attack you in melee, allowing you to mow him down with ranged attacks with impunity. [[Moloch's Sanctum]] itself contains no water or lava, but if you lure him up one level you can trap him on the [[vibrating square]] easily, though you will be hit in melee a few times.

While he is not tameable in his normal form, polymorphing into a [[genetic engineer]] will allow you to turn him into something that can be tamed.  This will eventually revert to being Cthulhu; as a pet, he is actually quite useful, doing unreal amounts of damage, not being covetous, and being fast.  Also, taming him provides the only way to get rid of him permanently: he will not be able to revive if displaced into lava.

Here, Cthulhu replaces the [[high priest of Moloch]] as the guardian of the [[Amulet of Yendor]]. He is potentially even more dangerous than in SLASH'EM as he is [[covetous]] and able to teleport to the player's location; however, as he is not considered a demon in UnNetHack, [[wand of death|wands of death]] or {{spell of|finger of death}} will work to kill Cthulhu. He also has an attack that makes the player lose memory of "25% of levels and 25% of objects" according to the sourcecode, as [[mind flayer]]s do in vanilla NetHack.

Applying a [[stethoscope]] to Cthulhu causes you to become [[confused]] for d20 (more) turns. 

{{clear}}

==SlashTHEM==
In [[SlashTHEM]], he is a sidekick to the high priest of Moloch. He is the guardian of the Amulet of Yendor, while the high priest will have a fake one.

==dNetHack==
See [[Great Cthulhu]].

==Origin==
Cthulhu comes from the works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]]. The encyclopedia entries are excerpts from Lovecraft works. Cthulhu is an important monster, giving its name to the "Cthulhu mythos" universe.

According to Lovecraft, "Cthulhu" was meant to be pronounced "Khlûl′-hloo". At the same time, however, he claimed that there is no "correct" pronunciation, since the name comes from an alien origin and includes sounds that humans aren't capable of producing. Most people just pronounce it "Ka-thu-lu". 

He appears gigantic, hundreds of meters tall, humanoid, an octopus-like head with an undefined number of tentacles, a pair of rudimentary membranous wings and a scale covered body. His ability to disintegrate into a cloud when defeated, and then reform himself, comes from Lovecraft's story "The Call of Cthulhu".

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"The Thing cannot be described -- there is no language for such
abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch
contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.  A
mountain walked or stumbled.  God!... the Thing of the idols,
the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awakened to claim
his own.  The stars were right again... great Cthulhu was
loose again, and ravening for delight."
{{right-align|[ The Call of Cthulhu, by H.P. Lovecraft ]}}

The exact origins of Cthulhu are lost to time, but it is
known that in aeons long past a race of space faring
beings came to this world and Cthulhu was amongst their
number as the high priest who interceded between them
and the dark gods they worshipped.  Whether Cthulhu is
a long lived individual or a title of office, is not
known, but a creature bearing this name lives on,
trapped in eternal slumber in the ruins of his great
city.

== Availability ==

The last version of NetHack Plus is available at Ali Harlow's web site in two parts:

* [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/source/nhplus01.zip Part 1]
* [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/source/nhplus02.zip Part 2]

Earlier versions are not known to survive.  This version is ported to [[MS-DOS]] only, although other ports might be possible to make.

This last released version of NetHack Plus is based mainly on [[NetHack 3.1.3]]; however, many of the dungeon description files are closer to those in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

== Significant changes ==

NetHack Plus adds new roles, objects, and monsters to [[NetHack 3.1.3]], and adds the [[black market]] to the dungeon.

== The adventurer ==

The player may choose from these roles, in addition to those in [[NetHack 3.1.3]]:

{| class="prettytable"
|-
!Role!!Alignment||Initial pet
|-
|[[Doppelganger]]||Neutral||[[little dog]] or [[kitten]]
|-
|[[Flame Mage]]||Neutral||[[baby red dragon]]
|-
|[[Ice Mage]]||Neutral||[[baby white dragon]]
|-
|[[Lycanthrope]]||Chaotic||[[wolf]]
|-
|[[Monk]]||Neutral||little dog or kitten
|-
|[[Undead Slayer]]||Lawful||little dog or kitten
|-
|}

[[Barbarian]]s are changed from neutral to chaotic, and [[Elf|Elves]] from chaotic to lawful.

All classes permit male and female adventurers, except the [[Valkyrie]] which must be female.

The adventurer has [[experience]], [[hit points]], [[magical energy]],
[[armor class]], [[alignment]], and the six major [[attribute]]s.  He may
advance to [[experience level]] 30.

== Dungeon features ==

The dungeon is similar to that of [[NetHack 3.1.3]], differing in that it adds the [[black market]] anywhere from 1 to 3 levels above the [[Castle]].  The black market is accessed by a [[magic portal]].

The requirements to win the game are the same as in NetHack 3.1.3. 

[[Special room]]s are the same as in NetHack 3.1.3.  There is one additional type of [[shop]], a [[pet shop]].

Special [[dungeon feature]]s are the same as in NetHack 3.1.3, except that the [[water weird fountain]] is added if WWEIRD is defined at compile time.

NetHack Plus defines no traps that are not present in NetHack 3.1.3.

== Bestiary ==
