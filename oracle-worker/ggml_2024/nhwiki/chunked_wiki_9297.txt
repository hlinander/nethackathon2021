|-

|'''[[spellbook of acid blast]]'''
|ATTACK
|6
| 
* Inherited from EvilHack, originally from GruntHack.
* A serious damage-causing spell, will transition from a ray to an area of effect spell much like the spells fireball and cone of cold, damage output is on the same scale to creatures that do not resist acid. Can corrode objects in the target's inventory.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of command undead]]'''
|NECROMANCY
|4
| 
* Was an ATTACK spell in SLASH'EM, now a NECROMANCY spell.
* This spell is equivalent to charm monster, except that it only affects undead.
* Was a level 5 spell in SLASH'EM, now level 4.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of enlighten]]'''
|DIVINATION
|4
| 
* Using this is equivalent to the wand of enlightenment.
* Was a BODY spell in SLASH'EM, now DIVINATION.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of fire bolt]]'''
|MATTER
|1
| 
* Fire Bolt is only available to the Flame Mage and will not generate randomly.
* The spellbook itself is immune to fire.
* A fire attack (similar to force bolt) that doesn't reflect and can hit multiple targets. Destroys doors, trees, grass, webs, fountains and can insta-kill straw and paper golems.
* Damage scales with level:

** Level 1 = 1d10 fire damage
** Level 4 = 1d10 + 1d8 fire damage
** Level 8 = 1d10 + 2d8 fire damage
** Level 12 = 1d10 + 3d8 fire damage
** Matter at Skilled adds +1d4 fire damage
** Matter at Expert adds +1d4 fire damage
|-

|'''[[spellbook of flame sphere]]'''
|MATTER
|1
| 
* Inherited from EvilHack, originally from SLASH'EM.
* This spell creates a number of tame [[flaming spheres]] dependent on the skill of the caster.
* The spellbook itself is immune to fire.
* Was a level 2 spell in EvilHack.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of freeze sphere]]'''
|MATTER
|1
| 
* Inherited from EvilHack, originally from SLASH'EM.
* This spell creates a number of tame [[freezing spheres]] dependent on the skill of the caster.
* Was a level 2 spell in EvilHack.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of lightning]]'''
|ATTACK
|4
| 
* Inherited from EvilHack, originally from SLASH'EM.
* This spell shoots a powerful lightning bolt as a ray from the caster. Effects are basically the same as a wand of lightning, damage output uses the same scale as the spells fireball and cone of cold.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of passwall]]'''
|ESCAPE
|5
| 
* Grants temporary intrinsic phasing, allowing you to pass through solid walls and other objects for anywhere between 50 and 149 turns before they become solid again.

|-

|'''[[spellbook of poison blast]]'''
|ATTACK
|4
| 
* Inherited from EvilHack (where it's a level 5 spell), but this spell originally came from SLASH'EM (level 4).
* Produces a cloud of noxious gas in a ray pattern, same effects much like a green dragons breath attack.
* Reduced to level 2.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of psionic wave]]'''
|ATTACK
|1
| 
* Not generated randomly.
* This "spell" acts as the illithid race's psychic attack. When playing as the illithid race you will automatically start with this spell, but you will NOT start with the spellbook. 
* This psionic attack can confuse and kill, and is tied to spell power use (but is not considered a spell for the purposes of Amulet of Yendor interactions). If your race is changed (e.g. by getting crowned as an infidel), this ability is lost.
* This spell will not time out as a normal spell would.
* Does 2d6 psychic damage.
* At XL 26, this increases to 4d6 psychic damage.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of reflection]]'''
|MATTER
|5
| 
* Creates a temporary reflective bubble around the caster.
* While active this acts exactly the same as an amulet of reflection (or the like)
|-
|'''[[spellbook of repair armor]]'''
|MATTER
|3
| 
* Repairs one level of damage to any worn piece of armor. 
* Will not make armor items fixed. 
* Works as a foil to the new monster spell 'destroy armor'
|-

|'''[[spellbook of sonicboom]]'''
|MATTER
|4
| 
* From SpliceHack.
* Similar to a cone of cold, but inflicts sonic damage.
|-

|'''[[spellbook of summon undead]]'''
|NECROMANCY
|5
| 
* Was an ATTACK spell in SLASH'EM, now a NECROMANCY spell.
* 72 in 73 chance of creating one undead monster and a 1 in 73 chance of creating five undead. 
* Necromancers will automatically attempt to dominate the resulting monster(s). Monster(s) may resist, based on their MR.
|-

|}

=== Spellcasting Changes ===

* Spell memory for books now matches SLASH'EM (10000 turns). The reinforce memory technique can be used to extend your spell memory when it gets low.
* Removed the BODY spell school in SLASH'EM, moved to the ESCAPE spells
* Removed PROTECTION spell school in SlashEM, moved to the CLERIC spells
* Removed CLERIC spell school and created a NECROMANCY spell school to support the new spin on the Necromancer role. The spells from the CLERIC school have been distributed among the other schools as appropriate.
* Increased available max spells by 10 (Added 0-9 for spell list letters)
* Spellbook weights are now based on their level.
* Spellcasting while wearing body armor will negatively affect your spell success rate.
  - The exception to this is [[crystal plate mail]], which does not adversely affect spellcasting in any way.
* Casting any spell successfully adds +500 turns to your memory of it (from SLASH'EM)

=== Monster Mage spells ===

* What's new: can now rust any unprotected worn armor.

'''Vulnerability''' (new)
