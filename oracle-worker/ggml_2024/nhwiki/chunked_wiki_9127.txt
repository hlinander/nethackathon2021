==Strategy==
Upgrading objects, either by potions of gain level or the tinker techinque, is the "poor hacker's polypiling"{{refsrc|potion.c|2167|version=SLASH'EM_0.0.7E7F2}}. It can be used to get some good items without many of the risks of polypiling. Most of the transformations are also reversible, although polypiling in SLASH'EM is by default reversible, since objects revert after some time. Also note that most of the [[magical items]] transform into other magical items, and mundane items change into other mundane items. Thus, with a few exceptions, it is not a viable way to make more magical items for [[polypiling]]. However, many useful items can be obtained, including helms of brilliance, healthstones, tinning kits, and magic markers.

===Cost and safety===
One potion is used up per item (or stack of items) transformed, if using a potion of gain level. If using the tinker technique, much more time passes, using up nutrition and spawning enemies. Thus, gnomes can save on potions, but must find a safe place to tinker, so they are neither interrupted or killed. [[Boulder fort]]s work well, but may be hard to come by early in the game. Shops work very well in the early game, with the door locked. If you lack a way of (un)locking the door, you can also pick up an unpaid item and let the shopkeeper block the door. Be sure not to stand in a straight line from the door, so monsters can't shoot you, and beware tunneling monsters.

Upgrading a container doesn't destroy its contents, as polymorphing does.  However, if you upgrade a container to a bag of holding, it will explode if it contains an item that would cause an explosion{{refsrc|potion.c|2596|version=SLASH'EM_0.0.7E7F2}}.

===Enchanted armor and weapons===
One good use of upgrading is to get highly-enchanted armor or weapons. A +5 [[orcish helm]] may be upgraded into a +5 [[helm of brilliance]]. Also, since many transformations are reversible, the player may change a highly enchanted piece of armor from one type to another. For example, a wizard has less use of a +3 helm of telepathy than a +3 helm of brilliance. Similarly, a player could upgrade a +2 orcish dagger into a +2 great dagger, for two-weaponing with (or skill-training for) [[Magicbane]]. Additionally, Elven armor can be enchanted, fairly reliably, to +7 and then upgraded. For example, a +7 elven cloak can become something more useful like a cloak of magic resistance.

===Polyfodder===
Objects may also be upgraded for use in polypiling. Most magical items transform into other magical items, and most mundane items transform into other mundane items. Thus, upgrading objects for polyfodder will often be a waste of potions or time spent tinkering. The exceptions are mundane items which transform into magical items:
* flint stones
* dwarvish helms
* orcish helms
* dented pots
* dwarvish cloaks
* orcish cloaks
* leather gloves
* robes
* tin whistles
* wooden harps
* wooden flutes
* tooled horns
* sacks

[[SLASH'EM]] offers a new playable [[race]], Vampire. Vampires are always [[chaotic]] and can play as a [[barbarian]], [[ice mage]], [[necromancer]], [[rogue]], or [[wizard]]. Vampires offer a very different play experience from the other races. According to the guidebook:
{{guidebook|Vampires strike fear into the heart of many. Their super-human strength, notorious dexterity and resilience make them difficult to defeat while their almost hypnotic charm makes them dangerous opponents. Even their own Gods treat vampires with some distaste.}}

==Starting properties==
Vampires start with the following attributes:
*[[Regeneration]]
*[[Unbreathing]] (immunity to gas, spore, [[choking]], and [[drowning]] attacks)
*[[Flying]] (not to be confused with [[levitation]])
*[[Level-drain resistance]]

Note that all of these intrinsics are actually properties of the base [[vampire]] monster form. As a result all of these intrinsics will be temporarily lost if you [[polymorph]] into another form.

Vampires can use the following [[technique]]s:
*[[Draw blood]] (level 1)
*[[Dazzle]] (level 1)

Vampires also have an extra attack – a [[bite]] – which can [[drain life]] if it hits. Since this second attack is available from the beginning, vampires start out as very good fighters.

Vampires generally have superb stats, particularly their physical stats. The following table outlines their maximum (unaided) attribute levels.

For all of these advantages, vampires are set back by their difficulty in obtaining [[nutrition]]. They cannot eat food in the way that non-vampire adventurers can: the vampire's only source of sustenance is blood from fresh corpses, potions of blood, and of vampire blood. On the upside, they can eat a corpse and still sacrifice it (e. g. for [[altar]] farming). Also, like Doppelgangers, vampires are restricted in the two-weapon skill.

Vampires also start with a small penalty to [[luck]] and [[alignment record|alignment]], -1 and -5 respectively.{{refsrc|u_init.c|1390|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} This means that vampires should not wish or pray before turn 600, and will need to kill a few monsters to gain positive alignment.

==Strategy==
===Nutrition===
The early game as a vampire is primarily about [[nutrition]] management. The vampire can only drink fresh blood for nourishment. There are five ways to gain nutrition as a vampire: draining the blood of freshly killed corpses (you have 3 turns before the blood coagulates and becomes useless), draining blood with the biting attack ("You feed on the lifeblood"), drinking potions of blood or vampire blood, #praying to fend off starvation, and polymorphing into a form that can eat. This means that for most of the early and midgame, the comestibles you find in the dungeon ([[food ration]]s, [[tin]]s, etc.) will be useless to you. Since nutrition drawn from sucking blood is much less than that gained by eating a corpse, avoiding starvation is the primary challenge for a vampire until you can get your hands on a [[ring of slow digestion]], or get far enough into the game that 1) monsters take enough hits to kill that you can get several feedings from each, and 2) you can survive combat with such monsters.

Another significant challenge for vampires is gaining intrinsics. Vampires only have a 20% chance of gaining [[intrinsic]]s from draining corpses;{{refsrc|eat.c|481|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} all corpses drained are subject to the 20% chance before any additional restrictions on gaining the intrinsic apply.{{refsrc|eat.c|481|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} For example, a vampire draining a newt corpse has a 20% chance of possibly gaining power,{{refsrc|eat.c|481|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} but then must also pass the 33% chance a newt corpse has of conveying extra power.{{refsrc|eat.c|913|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} It is possible to gain [[strength]] by draining [[giant]] corpses, but one must pass both the 20% test for being a Vampire as well as meeting the 25% chance SLASH'EM imposes on increasing strength.{{refsrc|eat.c|1130|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} Combined with the vampire's inability to eat tins, the vampire's maximum strength of 19 will prove difficult to achieve without enhancement. More importantly, this makes critical and normally easily-obtained intrinsics such as [[fire resistance]], [[cold resistance]], [[sleep resistance]], and [[telepathy]] much more difficult to acquire, and you will have to modify your playing style accordingly.

On the upside, you are exempt from the penalties of [[cannibalism]], like [[caveman|cavemen]]. You will face no penalties for eating cats, dogs, and humans, whether in your normal form or polymorphed. (Vampires are way beyond that level of evil). Additionally there is an alignment bonus ("You feel evil and fiendish!") for draining the corpse of another vampire if you are still chaotic. In practice this is only possible with the corpse of a [[vampire bat]].

Non-vampire players polymorphed into a [[vampire]] have the same restrictions on eating as a player vampire, but cannot commit cannibalism (unless they are normally a caveman or orc) - draining the corpse of a cat will still result in the normal penalties.

If your character would start with food rations, you will start with [[potion of vampire blood|potions of vampire blood]] instead. These are obviously much more difficult to replenish and also have the disadvantages of being heavy and susceptible to boiling. Later in the game you will find these potions as well as [[potion of blood|potions of blood]] and [[potion of vampire blood|vampire blood]] on enemy vampires.
You can also turn [[fruit juice]] into [[diluted]] vampire blood using [[alchemy]]; you will need to spend one vampire blood potion as a reagent, so it's only worthwhile if you have a large stack of juice.

If you choose to play as a vampire, you will need a sensible nutrition-management strategy, which will likely include moving quickly, fighting weaponless, creating monsters, prayer, and if you can get your hands on it, a [[medical kit]].

====Moving quickly====
In the early game, the key to survival for the vampire is to keep moving deeper and deeper into the dungeon where you can find fresh victims to sate your hunger. Consequently, projects such as altar camping, retrieving stashes, farming, and returning to the Minetown temple for protection are much more risky, since going through too many empty levels brings with it the risk of starvation.

====Fighting weaponless====
Vampires can draw sustenance from their bite attack against certain monsters. Note that since your [[to-hit]] ratios will improve as your level increases, and since you will be fighting monsters that take longer to kill, you will find yourself adding nutrition the more you fight. In order to mitigate this, vampires should plan to fight weak monsters hand-to-hand or with a weak weapon they are unskilled in (such as a [[knife]]) in order to get in as many bites as possible and thus maximize the nutrition they gain from every monster encounter. A vampire player should think of every monster she encounters as an essential source of food, and avoid killing large numbers of weak monsters at once via conflict, spells, wands, etc. Vampires should also avoid wearing rings unnecessarily.

Take advantage of the vampire's intrinsic regeneration to drain corpses '''before you finish a battle'''. [[Sleep]] magic is also extremely useful. [[Carnivore]] [[pet]]s will be useful only for a very brief segment of the early game – they will eat corpses that you need to drain.

====Creating monsters====
A [[wand of create monster]] or [[wand of create horde|create horde]] should be saved as a food source for a vampire, especially once you have a decent artifact weapon. In a pinch, a couple of zaps will whip up a meal that can keep you from starving long enough to find that next [[throne room]] or [[leprechaun hall]]. A vampire spell caster who learns the spell [[create monster]] will be in a much better position to survive.

====Prayer====
Prayer is essential to survival for most vampires, because at one point or another you are likely to start fainting without any safe nutrition nearby. Save prayer for this eventuality rather than wasting it on healing from combat ... much better to retreat and take advantage of your regeneration to heal. When you're in a pinch, however, the message "Your stomach feels content" is very calming. Unless you start with a [[ring of slow digestion]], an [[atheist]] vampire is an extremely challenging conduct. Also, beware the vampire's starting alignment and luck penalty.

====Medical kit ====
If you happen upon a [[medical kit]] (leather bag), you can perform the [[draw blood]] technique. This allows you to create a potion of vampire blood at the cost of an [[experience level]] and one phial from the kit. (Put the kit down and [[loot]] it to count your phials.) The level that is drained is not taken off in the same way that a monster's [[Drain life (monster attack)|drain]] attack is: you will be set to the '''beginning''' of the counter of the previous level's [[experience points]].  This means you will need to regain the lost level by fighting or with a [[potion of full healing]]. Keep in mind two things with this technique: first, in the early game, levels generally come more quickly and are thus easier to replenish. Second, in the SLASH'EM late game, the difference between levels is always the same (50,000 XP). This technique can be a lifesaver if you are about to die and happen to have a medical kit (don't use it till you are in danger, as potions are heavy). A side benefit of this technique is keeping your level low, which due to the insanely tough monsters that appear at higher XP levels in SLASH'EM can be a lifesaver in the late early and early midgame.

If you receive an early wish, a medical kit is a popular choice for a vampire. Not only does it typically solve the nutrition problem, it also allows for the player to intentionally lower his level to easily run the [[protection racket]] without having to accumulate wealth and travel to mine town while level 1. It also is useful for generating said wealth as it is typically very expensive, depending on its contents.

A [[ring of slow digestion]] will help you out enormously, eliminating the need for strategy altogether. In fact, the combination of one of these rings with the 'life blood' draining passive attack (to gain nutrition), one could go the entire game without eating, and thus fill the requirements for the [[foodless]], [[vegetarian]], and [[vegan]] conducts. Beware of getting too satiated with the ring: you won't choke to death as you are [[unbreathing]], but you will often become paralyzed while feeding on the life blood of a foe, allowing several hits while you recover. If you are up against a hard-hitter like a mumak or a leocrotta, this can be fatal. Alleviate this by carrying around a hunger-causing ring ([[ring of conflict|conflict]], [[ring of regeneration|regeneration]], or even [[ring of hunger|hunger]]) to switch to when you get satiated to bring your nutrition level back to normal.

===Blood vs. lifeblood===
There is a difference between "blood" and "lifeblood". "Blood" is what certain monsters have in their corpses, available for draining after they are killed. Draining blood will give you approximately 20% of the nutrition of eating the entire corpse. Additionally, blood can be [[poison]]ous, [[acid]]ic, or hallucinogenic as the corpse would be. "Lifeblood", on the other hand, is the nutrition that is drained through the bite attack during combat and provides 2d6*6 nutrition (42 on average) on a successful drain. It is always safe to eat (never poisonous or acidic) and is extractable from anything with life force, even if it doesn't leave a corpse or contain blood (such as [[flaming sphere]]s, elementals, and [[grid bug]]s, but not undead). Vampires will automatically disable their bite attack when fighting petrifying monsters if they are wielding a weapon, unlike vanilla.

===Magical breathing===
By the late game the nutrition problem will mostly have resolved itself as you fight larger monsters with greater frequency. Hopefully you will also have access to a ring of slow digestion which you can equip permanently or intermittently to keep your hunger under control.

Since vampires do not breathe, they cannot [[choke]]. As with the [[amulet of magical breathing]], overeating may cause you to vomit and lose nutrition. It is always safe to choose "Yes" when asked if you want to continue eating when already overstuffed. This is important because you will almost always be eating lifeblood when you are fighting as a vampire. If you are overstuffed you will not die, but are at risk of occasionally losing a few turns in the midst of battle to alarm when you "choke". ("You regain your composure.")

===Intrinsics===
Since you will have a difficult time accumulating intrinsics as a vampire, getting oneself [[crowning|crowned]] is very useful. On the other hand, crowning will also increase prayer recovery time, which will put you at greater risk of starvation in the early and middle game. To accommodate the lack of intrinsics, magic-users may also want to make use of the new set of protection spells in SLASH'EM (endure heat, resist poison, etc.). These will be especially prized to the vampiric wizard, who can cast spells [[hungerless casting|without hunger]]. Note that vampires are immune to magical [[instadeath]] attacks like the [[touch of death]], but will also take double damage from [[Sunsword]], e.g. in the hands of an [[Archon]].

===Flying===
Flying is fun. Whereas levitation allows you to avoid traps, water and lava, but keeps you too high up to pick things up or otherwise interact with objects on the ground, flying gives you the best of both worlds. You will sail over traps and water and across the [[Plane of Air]] without having to mess around with boots, spells, or rings (or the SLASH'EM item, [[amulet of flying]]). This is particularly convenient in the endgame as you race for the starting staircase.

However, this also means you will need to avoid losing anything important in a [[pit]]. Since the vampire's flying ability is intrinsic there is no way to turn it off and descend. The only ways to retrieve an item trapped in a pit are to [[teleport]] it out with a wand, snag it with a [[bullwhip]] while levitating(!), or use the new [[fishing pole]] tool. Additionally, it is possible to dig downwards with a pick-axe and then descend with {{kbd|>}} and either hope the object falls or use autopickup to grab the item. You also may have a hard time getting things up out of water.

===Stoning===
While in vanilla NetHack players polymorphed into vampires have to be extra careful around [[petrify]]ing monsters, SLASH'EM's vampire's are intelligent enough to "turn off" their bite attack against such creatures. However, any other action which would stone a normal player (kicking a cockatrice without boots, attacking it bare-handed, etc) will obviously still stone a vampire. But attacking with gloved hands and no wielded weapon will stone you.

Vampires do have one additional difficulty around stoning monsters, though. Since they can only feed on fresh corpses, this makes [[lizard corpse]]s all but useless: vampires cannot drain them if they are more than a few turns old. It is still worth it for them to carry one, if only for the protection they provide on the [[new moon]]. However, vampires will also need to find a [[potion of acid]] or [[spellbook of stone to flesh]] as a means to reverse stoning, or may simply wish to consider wearing an [[amulet versus stone]]. Note that the amulet, if it saves your life, will break the [[survivor]] semi-conduct, but will not be destroyed unless [[cursed]].

'''UnNetHack''' 5 is a [[variant]] of NetHack 3.4.3, maintained by [[User:Bhaak|Patric Mueller]] and others.

The main intent of this fork is to put more randomness, challenges, and fun into NetHack.

It features more levels, several UI improvements designed to reduce tedium, and many gameplay-related changes.<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/5ee5599d1e6b7378</ref> Since 3.6.1 it also bundles a graphical tiles UI for Windows. The 5.1.0 version's default Windows tiles are not that good but it is bundled with [[Tileset| DawnHack tiles]].

For discussion, join the  IRC channel [irc://irc.libera.chat/unnethack #unnethack] on [[Libera|irc.libera.chat]] or post to [[rec.games.roguelike.nethack]].

For those curious what is added in UnNetHack, here is the [https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/blob/master/ChangeLog Change Log] that list major changes. If you want to see a complete list of changes, you can take a look at the [https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commits/master commit browser].

The latest development source code is available from the [https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack Git repository], and there are several [[public servers]] where it can be played online.

== Changes from NetHack 3.4.3 ==

=== Patches and general code ===
UnNetHack incorporates the following [[patch]]es:
* The [[Dumplog|dump patch]] (with additional HTML output)
* [[Heck² patch]]
* [[Menucolors]]
* [[Statuscolors]]
* [[Color alchemy]]
* Portions of the [[Lethe patch]], including [[Cthulhu]]

Version 5.0.0 adds the [[Convict|Convict role]], with its associated equipment and monsters.

Several features are incorporated from [[SLASH'EM]]:
* [[Options_(SLASH%27EM)#showweight|Show weight]] feature
* The [[nymph level]]
* The [[Black market (UnNetHack)|black market]] (modified)
* The [[Vampire (starting race in UnNetHack)|Vampire race]] (modified)

UnNetHack also fixes many vanilla bugs, such as the [[Astral call bug]]. Some of the changes made between 3.4.3 and 3.6.0 were taken from, or inspired by UnNetHack changes, and other variants incorporate content that originally appeared in UnNetHack.

UnNetHack features its own [[autoexplore]] implementation, adapted from AceHack.

=== Branch changes ===

====Existing branches====
Version 4.0.0 shortens [[Sokoban]] to three levels, adds new puzzle designs, and from UnNetHack 4.1.1 onwards, cheating in Sokoban does not incur a [[Luck]] penalty. {{main|Sokoban (UnNetHack)}}

As of version 5.0.0, [[Fort Ludios]] is more likely to be accessible: the portal will now be in the first vault generated below level 10. It still has a chance of being inaccessible if no vaults are generated below level 10.

The adventurer will be accepted by the quest leader to perform the quest from experience level 10 (rather than having to achieve experience level 14.)

====New branches====

*The [[Town]] (4.0.0): The Town is accessible from an upstairs located on the level below the entrance to Sokoban, and features numerous [[shops]], a town [[watch]], and [[mugger]]s who will attempt to steal your inventory. 
*The [[Ruins of Moria]] (5.0.0): The Ruins of Moria are located in the main dungeon somewhere above the black market. 
*The [[Black market (UnNetHack)|Black market]] (4.0.0)
*[[Sheol]] (5.0.0): Sheol is an ice-themed branch of [[Gehennom]], with special monsters, traps, and even terrain types.
*The [[Dragon Caves]] (4.0.0): The Dragon Caves are located deep within [[Gehennom]], and consist of multiple [[dragon]] and [[purple worm]]-infested caverns, with several [[Chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)|chromatic dragons]] waiting in a lair at the bottom.

For detailed changes in UnNetHack's dungeon branches, see the [[Mazes of Menace#Map 2|UnNethack dungeon map]].

=== Level changes ===
Certain special levels have been modified or given alternate versions, including the [[Castle]], [[Fort Ludios]], the [[Valley of the Dead]], [[Moloch's Sanctum]], and the lairs of the various demon lords. Listed here are examples of some of the different level variations:

* [http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg12/scaled.php?server=12&filename=unnethackcastle.png&res=landing Castle]
* [http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg715/scaled.php?server=715&filename=asmodeuslevel.png&res=landing Asmodeus's lair]
* [http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg692/scaled.php?server=692&filename=jubilex.png&res=landing Juiblex's Swamp] 
* [http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg59/scaled.php?server=59&filename=baalzebublair.png&res=landing Baalzebub's lair]
* [http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg821/scaled.php?server=821&filename=orcustown.png&res=landing Orcus Town]

Lots of new maps for [[Big Room]] are also added.

Random level generation has also been modified. In addition to [[Special room (UnNetHack)|new special rooms]], wallified corridors, and various other changes, the dungeon now contains [[Random vault (UnNetHack)|random vaults]] that add significant variety to what the dungeon can look like.

The [[vibrating square]] is somewhat easier to find. When the player is two squares away from it, he will receive the message "you feel a faint trembling under your feet". One square away the player will receive the message "you feel a weak trembling under your feet". Once on top the vibrating square the message is the typical "you feel a strange vibration under your feet".

[[Moloch's Sanctum]] has been changed significantly. It now features a modified map with two sections separated by an expanse of [[lava]] and a double [[drawbridge]]. Inside the inner Sanctum, the initially peaceful priest of Moloch is accompanied with [[Cthulhu]], who now carries the [[Amulet of Yendor]], and who reappears a few turns after being killed. The Amulet teleports whenever it is dropped, so after killing Cthulhu for the first time the player must locate the amulet within the level. This may require continuing to fend off Cthulhu&mdash;unless the player finds a way to get rid of him permanently.

[[Dragon]]s have been substantially modified in UnNetHack (more info on [[Dragon#UnNetHack]]).

The [[antimatter vortex]] was added in version 4.0.0 but removed in 5.0.0.

=== Objects ===
<ref>http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unnethack/log/trunk/src/objects.c</ref>
==== New objects ====

* A [[tinfoil hat]] that blocks [[clairvoyance]] and impedes [[spellcasting]].
* [[Glowing dragon scales]] and [[Glowing dragon scale mail|scale mail]], which act as a permanent light source and provide stone resistance.
* [[Chromatic dragon scales]] and [[chromatic dragon scale mail]], which provide all resistances (including reflection) except magic resistance (includes magic resistance as of 5.2.0).
* Rings of [[Ring of gain intelligence|gain intelligence]], [[Ring of gain wisdom|wisdom]], and [[Ring of gain dexterity|dexterity]] from [[SLASH'EM]].
* [[Potion of blood|Potions of blood]] which have nutritional value for vampires.
* [[Potion of vampire blood|Potions of vampire blood]] which polymorph the player into a vampire.
* A [[scroll of flood]], replacing the [[scroll of amnesia]].
* An [[iron safe]] as a container.

==== Artifacts ====
* [[Itlachiayaque]] replaces the [[Orb of Detection]] as the [[quest artifact]] for the [[Archeologist]]s.
* [[The Heart of Ahriman]] now grants [[displacement]] and energy regeneration instead of [[stealth]].
* [[Luckblade|Luck Blade]] from [[SLASH'EM]] is added in version 5.0.0, as the first sacrifice gift for [[Convict]]s.

Changes to [[The Banes]]:
* [[Thiefbane]] has been added, in support of the [[Black market (UnNetHack)|black market]].
* The Banes can [[cancellation|cancel]] their targeted monsters.
* [[The Banes]] (not including [[Thiefbane]]) warn of their targeted monsters.
* [[Werebane]] grants [[polymorph control]] while wielded.
* [[Dragonbane]] grants fire, shock, cold, acid, poison, and disintegration resistance.
* [[Vorpal Blade]] warns of [[jabberwock]]s.
* Wielding [[Trollsbane]] grants hungerless [[regeneration]] and prevents trolls from leaving corpses.
* [[Ogresmasher]] increases wielder's [[constitution]] to 25, gives a +d4 damage to all monsters, and has a 50% chance of instantly killing [[ogres]] (a la [[Sporkhack]]). (While not named a "bane", Ogresmasher fits the category perfectly.)

==== Other object changes ====
Wands will now turn to dust after the first time they are wrested, however, the odds of wresting have been greatly increased, and is dependent on [[BUC]].

The [[scroll of genocide]] wipes out a single species throughout the dungeon when blessed, and a single species on the dungeon level when uncursed. Cursed genocide is unchanged

When a [[cursed]] object is fired or thrown, there is a chance that it will hit the ceiling instead of its target.

Wearing correct racial armor grants an extra 1 AC per piece worn.

=== Wishing ===
{{main|Wish#UnNetHack}}

Wishing is less accessible&mdash;[[wand of wishing|wands of wishing]] are generated already recharged once, and are the only source of wishes for magical items. Non-magical wishes are still available from [[magic lamp]]s.

Thrones no longer grant wishes in any form.

&&%s&& %s Potion of amnesia {150001 2023-02-19T06:45:13Z {375 Ion frigate} Another "I've played this game for a decade and a half and I had no idea it worked this way" moment - there are two kinds of shopkeeper debt, ordinary debt and "robbed" debt; amnesia only clears the latter {{potion
  
|color = cyan
|tile = [[Image:Sparkling potion.png]]
|name = potion of amnesia
|appearance = sparkling potion
|fullcost = 100
}}

A '''potion of amnesia''' (unidentified, a "sparkling potion") is a [[SLASH'EM]] specific item.

Quaffing it will cause you to forget all of the current map, has a 1/3 chance of causing you to forget some level maps, and another 1/3 chance of forgetting some discoveries.
If it is non-blessed, it also may cause you to forget some spells.
If it is blessed, it will cure lycanthropy and sickness and give you 51-100 nutrition points.
Monsters will throw this at the player with similar effects.

This potion cannot be cancelled.

==Dipping==
Dipping an object into the potion has a number of effects. Objects with positive enchantment may lose one level of enchantment ("Amnesia acts as a disenchanter"). Rustprone objects have a 50% chance of rusting, erodeproof objects have a 1/13 chance of losing their erodeproof status. Blessed or cursed objects will also become uncursed. Magic markers lose 2 + 1d10 charges. 

Some objects will also be downgraded to non-magical versions. Many of these changes can be undone using a [[potion of gain level]] to [[upgrading objects|upgrade]] the object. The affected objects are:
{|class="prettytable striped"
!Old object
!New object
|-
|Loadstone || rowspan="4" |Flint stone
|-
|Luckstone
|-
|Healthstone
|-
|Touchstone
|-
|Magic lamp || oil lamp
|-
|Magic candle || Wax candle or <br /> Tallow candle
|-
|Drum of earthquake || Leather drum
|-
|Magic whistle || Tin whistle
|-
|Magic flute || Wooden flute
|-
|Magic harp || Wooden harp
|-
|Fire horn || rowspan="3" |Tooled horn
|-
|Frost horn
|-
|Horn of plenty
|}

Dipping the potion into a water source will cause it to become a potion of water in one dipping, without the diluted stage.
This preserves the beattitude of the potion, and as such may be used as a source of (un)holy water if an appropriately aligned altar is unavailable.

===Lethe waters===
The Lethe waters affect items and the player in similar ways. SLASH'EM does not fully implement the Lethe patch, but the castle moat is currently considered Lethe water. The castle moat can therefore be used as an infinite supply of potions of amnesia for downgrading objects. Dipping a potion of water into the castle moat will always result in a potion of amnesia.

The Lethe waters have a 100% chance of rusting rust-prone objects (this would be 25% if the object is blessed, but the blessed status is removed first) and a 20% chance of removing erodeproofing from an item. A scroll dipped in the Lethe water has a 10% chance of turning into a scroll of amnesia instead of blank paper. 

==Throwing==
When throwing a potion of amnesia, make sure there is at least one empty square between you and your target - otherwise, you will be subjected to the vapors of the potion, potentially forgetting maps and item identities.

This potion can also be used to pacify angry shopkeepers "''Shopkeeper'' looks at you curiously!".  In some circumstances, this can also erase any debt you have.  Specifically, when you escape a store with unpaid items or debt, the shopkeeper is considered "robbed", your ordinary shopping debt is erased, any stolen items become yours, and in order to pacify the shopkeeper, you would normally need to give them at least half the amount for which they were robbed, i.e. half the total of your debt and the value of the stolen items.<ref>[[Source:SLASH'EM_0.0.7E7F2/shk.c|shk.c]] and [[Source:SLASH'EM_0.0.7E7F2/potion.c|potion.c]], in particular the functions do_pay and make_happy_shk</ref>  Hitting a shopkeeper with a potion of amnesia causes shopkeepers to forget about being robbed - no matter how much they were robbed for - but does not cause them to forget ordinary shopping debt or unpaid items.

Hitting a non-covetous monster with a potion of amnesia has a 75% chance of making them peaceful (and untame if they were tame) if they do not resist "''Monster'' looks bewildered!". Hitting a flaming sphere or iron golem will do 1d6 damage. Hitting a gremlin will cause it to split, with no other effects. Hitting the Wizard of Yendor will cause '''you''' to forget, as per reading a blessed [[scroll of amnesia]]<ref>{{sourcecode|potion.c|1401|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>. Hitting certain monsters with the potion will produce YAFM and no other effects:

{|class="prettytable"
! Monster
! Message
|-
|[[Medusa]]     ||    Medusa looks like she's having a bad hair day!
|-
|[[Croesus]]     ||    Croesus says: 'My gold! I must count my gold!'
|-
|[[Death]]     ||    Death pauses, then looks at you thoughtfully!
|-
|[[Famine]]     ||    Famine looks unusually hungry!
|-
|[[Pestilence]]     ||    Pestilence looks unusually well!
|}

Being hit with the potion has a 90% chance of causing your helmet to be subjected to the effects of the potion (50% chance if the helmet is cursed, as a cursed helmet would benefit from the potion). You will also be subjected to the vapors of the potion, causing you to forget items and spells.

== Strategy ==
The potion of amnesia can be used to uncurse or unbless items, but as they can result in losing enchantment, charges, and rusting, this is usually suboptimal. Drinking the potion is usually bad, and as the appearance is not randomized it is trivial to avoid. Drinking a blessed potion can be used to cure [[lycanthropy]] or [[sickness]] if no other alternatives are available. The potion also gives a surprising amount of nutrition when blessed, which may be of use for a [[foodless]] ascension.

Monsters will throw this potion at you, causing amnesia, so it is advisable to pick up any that you find, even if you do not intend to use them.  If you plan on breaking the potion by throwing it, make sure there is an empty square between you and the wall you throw it at.  Generally it is better to keep it to dilute, but if you don't have a sack or a handy fountain, destroying it may be preferable, since you will be subjected to the vapors if the potion is destroyed by a fire attack.

Since there is no defense against thrown potions of amnesia, its effects need to be mitigated. Identifying as many things as possible will reduce the likelihood of having actually useful discoveries forgotten. Collect items in your stash and name them. Collect scrolls of identify even if you don't need them. Place spells of little value at the end of your spell list, because spells are forgotten starting from the bottom. Try to read several [[spellbook]]s that you intend to forget for the confusion-on-demand they'll provide. Otherwise, you'll have to wait 10,000 turns to reforget them. Keep some equipment to fix your helmet if it gets damaged.

Downgrading objects can also be useful. Downgrading a magical flute, horn, harp, or drum will result in the non-magical equivalent, all of which can be upgraded back to the magical tool with a potion of gain level. This will restore some charges, in case no other method of charging an object is available. "Downgrading" a [[loadstone]] will turn it into a flint stone that can be dropped. Downgrading any extra [[luckstone]]s, [[touchstone]]s, and all loadstones can provide the player with a healthy selection of flint stones that can be upgraded to [[healthstone]]s. Having multiple luckstones is rarely useful, but the effects of healthstones stack, and a large stack of flint stones can be upgraded with a single potion of gain level. If the upgrade results in luckstones (50% chance) then the luck stones can just be downgraded again. In all cases mentioned above, the [[tinker]] technique can substitute for the potion of gain level.

Beware using this potion in random alchemy - if it explodes you will be affected by the vapors unless you have magical breathing '''and''' lack eyes. The [[nightgaunt]] is the most suitable form for this, as they have [[magical breathing]], [[Eyeless|no eyes]], and [[Flying|fly]].

The counter u.utrap is setup in the routine lava_effects [[trap.c#line3991]] as rn1(4, 4) + (rn1(4, 12) << 8).  It is then decremented by 1<<8 and incremented by rnd(4) each turn until it is less than 1<<8.  Since rn1(x,y) returns a number from y to y + x - 1 and x << y is equivalent to x * (2 ^ Y) u.utrap starts between 3076 and 3847, and is decreased by 253 to 256 each turn.

&&%s&& %s Deep one {146833 2022-07-21T10:26:32Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Encyclopedia Entry */ '''Deep ones''' are new monsters added in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNetHack]]. There is a large level difference between the deep ones and deepest ones, so once you are experienced enough for deep ones to appear you will likely encounter them in some form until the end game. This also means that if a lower level character manages to [[tame]] a deep one (which is not difficult as their [[monster MR|MR]] is only 10), they will eventually have a level 45 pet deepest one. All deep ones are capable of [[treachery]], but will eat corpses and thus are relatively easy to keep tame.

The deep one is the only form that is capable of wearing body armor and cloaks, and all forms can wear all other types of armor. If a deep one wearing body armor grows up into a deeper one, the body armor is not destroyed as with polymorphing into a larger size, so it is possible to raise a deepest one that wears a full ascension kit of armor.

Deep ones are capable of swimming and will also be frequently generated on the [[Plane of Water]].

Deep(er, est) ones play a much greater role in dNethack. They are abundantly generated on the Anachrononaut quest, complete with firearms and other future weapons.  They are also generated in the the Gulf of N'Kai in the Neutral Quest.  In addition, deep and deeper ones can be spawned in a dNethack throne room, with a deepest one as the overlord.

In addition, they each have a passive on-death effect. When a deep one dies, every other deep(er, est) one on the level receives +2 max hp. Deeper ones give +4, and deepest ones give +8. If this is enough to bring them to a new level threshold, they'll grow up into the next stage of evolution and deal more damage. This only applies to monsters currently on the level though, so it won't apply to monsters generated in the future.

== Mythology ==

The deep one and its related kin all come from "The Shadow over Innsmouth" by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], creator of the Cthulhu mythos.

They are intelligent ocean-dwelling creatures, and are fishy/froggy humanoids in appearance. The transition from deep one to deepest one in-game is a reference to the deep one-like giants in Lovecraft's earlier short story "Dagon."  Deep ones are immortal, and in the wider Cthulhu mythos it is accepted that they grow continuously throughout their lives.  The oldest deep ones, therefore, would be very large indeed, thus explaining both the human-sized deep ones in "Innsmouth" and the whale-sized giants living in the deep ocean in "Dagon."

A '''kamadan''', {{monsym|kamadan}}, is a type of [[monster]] that is introduced in [[SLASH 6]], and appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is a [[feline]] with three bite attacks and a breath attack that induces [[sleep]]ing.

Eating a kamadan corpse has a 27% chance of conveying [[sleep resistance]].

==Strategy==
The kamadan is capable of appearing quite early, and its sleep breath and bites can prove dangerous if you are caught unaware and lacking resistance.

==Origin==
The kamadan originates from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', and is depicted as a beast that almost exactly resembles a leopard, save for the six snakes sprouting from its shoulders. Kamadans hunt using a sleeping gas breath weapon to knock its prey unconscious before moving for the kill, and a kamadan's snakes also possessed a powerful poison in their bites. They are occasionally speculated in-universe to be related to [[displacer beast]]s, though their similarities are coincidental - in fact, kamadans despise displacer beasts and are known to attack them on sight.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The kamadan is a greatly feared hunter that resembles a large leopard with six snakes sprouting from its shoulders. Sages believe it is a distant relative of the displacer beast, though how it came to be is still a matter for speculation.
