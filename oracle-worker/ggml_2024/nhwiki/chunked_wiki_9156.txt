'''Deluder''' is an artifact [[cloak of displacement]] in [[SLASH'EM]]. In addition to the normal effects of cloaks of displacement, it confers [[stealth]] when worn and acts as a [[luckstone]] when carried.  It is the guaranteed second sacrifice gift for [[Wizard]]s.

==Strategy==
As a cloak of displacement, Deluder only provides [[Magic cancellation|MC 2]]. That limits its usefulness, as most wizards will prefer the MC 3 granted by their starting [[cloak of magic resistance]]. Its best use is probably as a substitute luckstone for wizards who find an early altar.  A character who gets Deluder might as well keep it in preference to an ordinary luckstone: it weighs the same, but will provide a modest [[score]] bonus when you ascend.

Overall, this artifact mostly serves to make it more difficult for Wizards to sacrifice for a high-damage artifact weapon.

The '''Sword of Justice''' is a [[lawful]] [[artifact]] [[long sword]] in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SpliceHack]].  It has +5 to hit and +12 to damage to all cross-aligned monsters.  It is the guaranteed first sacrifice gift for [[yeoman|yeomen]].

==Strategy==
It's a pretty good weapon: in terms of damage, it's actually on par with [[the Sceptre of Might]] in vanilla NetHack, and is far better than the version in SLASH'EM.  It is particularly useful since almost no lawful monsters are always generated hostile, meaning that a character with a reasonably good [[alignment]] record will very rarely encounter a monster which is not subject to the Sword of Justice's extra damage.  It is well worth sacrificing for if you're a yeoman.  Like most non-quest artifacts, however, it's certainly not worth an artifact wish, especially since lawfuls can just dip for [[Excalibur]] anyway.

==SpliceHack==
In SpliceHack, the Sword of Justice is a broadsword and not affiliated with any role. Additionally, the flat damage and to-hit bonuses are converted to dice rolls.

'''Reaper''' is a [[lawful]] [[artifact]] [[halberd]] in [[SLASH'EM]].  It has +5 to hit and +20 to damage when [[pounding]].  It is the guaranteed second sacrifice gift for [[yeoman|yeomen]].

==Strategy==
This weapon is tied with the [[Bat from Hell]] for the highest damage bonus in the game that works against any monster, and has a higher base damage.  Unfortunately, it is somewhat less useful for most roles, since its damage bonus only applies when pounding or when attacking from a mount, and it requires both hands thus preventing two weapon combat.  Its utility depends on your play style: if you are making thorough use of [[riding]] and polearms, it is possibly the best artifact weapon in the game.  If instead you are simply playing as a straightforward fighter, it is better to use as a supplement to a more traditional melee weapon.

Note that both [[Mjollnir]] at +24 and [[Disrupter]] at +30 have higher damage bonuses than Reaper, but Mjollnir's damage bonus doesn't apply to shock-resistant monsters, and Disrupter's only applies versus undead.

'''Plague''' is an [[artifact weapon|artifact]] [[bow]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]], [[dNetHack]], [[SlashTHEM]], and [[SpliceHack]]. It is [[chaotic]] aligned in all appearances, and typically favors [[Drow (starting race)|drow]].

==SLASH'EM==
Plague is [[chaotic]]-aligned and grants +5 to-hit and +7 to damage when firing arrows from it; arrows fired from Plague are auto-[[poison]]ed, and it confers [[poison resistance]] while wielded.  As dark elven bows are not randomly generated, it will not generate randomly, but may be given as a sacrifice gift or [[wish]]ed for.

==dNetHack==
In dNetHack, Plague is a normal bow made from [[bone]] and can be invoked to temporarily treat arrows it fires as coated in filth: these arrows have a 20% chance of instantly killing monsters without [[sickness resistance]], who then explode - the explosion's size depends on the slain monster and deals 6d6 damage to monsters caught in it. It also confers sickness resistance while wielded.

==SlashTHEM==
In addition to its traits in SLASH'EM, SlashTHEM also makes Plague available at [[The Forge]].

==SpliceHack==
In [[SpliceHack]], Plague's flat bonuses are changed to dice rolls: it does +d7 damage and +d5 to-hit compared to a regular dark elven bow. It is a sacrifice gift for [[Drow]].

&&%s&& %s Sigil of tempest {104923 2017-01-29T18:42:07Z {4000865 Tomsod} low damage bug '''Sigil of tempest''' is a [[technique]] in [[SLASH'EM]]. When used, it creates 3x3 explosions around you centered in a 7x7 area (excluding the 3x3 area around you, so you will not be hit) instead of firing a [[ray]]. This technique affects all ray-based spells except {{Spell of|finger of death}}.

When used with [[sigil of control]], the explosion can be controlled as if you cast {{Spell of|fireball}} or {{Spell of|cone of cold}} at [[skilled]] level or above in vanilla [[NetHack]].

When used with [[sigil of discharge]], the number of explosions doubles.

==Bugs==

Most ray-based spells in SLASH'EM, as well as [[fireball]] explosion, use six-sided damage dice.  It seems sigil of tempest explosions were supposed to deal (XL/4 + bonus)d6 damage{{refsrc|zap.c|2273|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}, however, due to what is probably a bug, they do only plain (XL/4 + bonus) damage<ref>cf. fireball code: {{sourcecode|zap.c|4246|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>, resulting in single digit damage in most cases, making the technique mostly useless.

&&%s&& %s Sigil of discharge {104924 2017-01-29T18:51:32Z {4000865 Tomsod} low damage bug '''Sigil of discharge''' is a [[technique]] in [[SLASH'EM]]. When used, it expands most [[ray]]-based spells into 3x3 explosions, similar to the [[spirit bomb]]. However, the explosion's range is much longer (about 7-9 tiles). Although this technique turns rays into explosions, they still bounce when the explosion hit the wall. This technique has no effects on the {{Spell of|finger of death}}. This technique can be very risky if there are tame/peaceful creatures around―unlike [[spirit bomb]], your spells can still hit them if they are in the way!

When you cast a spell with this technique active, an additional message will be displayed. Different spells have different messages:

{|class="prettytable"

|}

==Bugs==

Similarly to [[sigil of tempest]], the technique does very little damage, which is probably a bug: while ordinary rays in SLASH'EM do (XL/2 + bonus)d6 damage, discharged rays only do plain (XL/2 + bonus).  The exception is the monster standing directly before you when you cast the spell: it recieves normal ray damage.

&&%s&& %s Game stages {144323 2022-02-02T11:56:11Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  Like most games, a [[Player|character's]] progress through [[NetHack]] can be broken down into several '''game stages'''.

{{tocright}}

==The early game==
The first stage is the early game where survival and sometimes securing [[food]] is of supreme importance. For many roles, the [[pet#starting_pet|starting pet]] is likely more powerful than the character itself. Securing basic [[armor]] and [[weapon|weaponry]] is a top priority; use your [[pet]] to [[curse testing#pet_testing|test]] the [[BUC]] status of items before you use or wear them. Many new players have trouble finding enough food: when they are [[Nutrition|weak with hunger]] they should probably [[prayer|pray]] for nutrition and save their [[permafood]] for when they cannot pray. More experienced players will find they have enough [[food]] almost all the time and will want to eat the [[permafood]] and conserve their ability to pray. Safe [[corpse]]s are preferable to both, of course. Above all else, take it slow and be careful! The early game can be the most difficult stage of [[NetHack]].

===Early game threats===
Ranked roughly in order of danger from most to least.
* Team {{mcsl|a}}: As a rule of thumb, any [[monster]] represented by an {{monclasssym|a}} is a huge threat to an early character. They have high [[speed]], and get multiple attacks on each of their many [[turn]]s. To top it off, all of these monsters are generated in groups. Engrave [[Elbereth]] at first sight with these creatures, even if just with your [[fingers]]. Using [[attack wand]]s is not out of the question either.
** {{monsymlink|soldier ant}} and {{monsymlink|killer bee}}: These can [[poison]] you to reduce your [[strength]], [[hit points]], or even cause [[instadeath|instant death]] if the RNG hates you. [[Magic cancellation]] will help block the [[poison]] but not the physical damage.
** {{monsymlink|fire ant}}: These cannot [[poison]] you, but instead can light you on [[fire]], causing [[scroll]]s to [[fire|burn]], [[potion]]s to [[fire|boil]], and some [[armor]] to smolder. Again, [[magic cancellation]] can help somewhat by blocking the fire damage, but not the physical damage.
** {{monsymlink|giant ant}}: These are mercifully much weaker than their soldier cousins, but are not to be underestimated; many a character has been killed by these insects.
** {{monsymlink|giant beetle}}: These are an exception; they are very slow and have only one attack. Characters can easily use [[hit and run]] tactics to defeat them.
* {{monsymlink|leocrotta}}: They are fast enough to get 3 [[turn]]s for every 2 of a character who isn't [[fast]] or [[very fast]], and have three highly damaging attacks. They thankfully lack any [[resistance]]s and have low [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]], meaning that [[attack wand]]s are quite useful. They respect [[Elbereth]].
* [[Unicorn]]s: the {{monsymlink|white unicorn}}, {{monsymlink|gray unicorn}}, and the {{monsymlink|black unicorn}}: Unicorns have potent attacks, but will try to remain a knight's move away from you instead of engaging. A hapless [[fast]], [[very fast]], or [[invisible]] player can end up adjacent to one however, and it will continue attacking until you or it dies. Use [[Elbereth]] or pacify it by throwing a [[gem]] at it, which may also alter your [[Luck]]; see [[unicorn|the main article]] for details.
* [[Lycanthrope]]s: the {{monsymlink|wererat}}, {{monsymlink|werejackal}}, and {{monsymlink|werewolf}}: [[Werecreature]]s are likely to be the first [[shapeshifter]]s encountered, and are thankfully limited to just two forms. They are still a threat however, due to their [[lycanthropy|infectious bite]] and ability to summon up to five normal animals of their kind (e.g. normal [[jackal]]s or normal [[rat]]s) to tear you to shreds. [[Elbereth]] will only work on [[werecreature]]s while they are in animal form. Should you be infected with [[lycanthropy]], you should soon eat a [[sprig of wolfsbane]] or quaff a [[potion of holy water]] to cure it; if you have neither, you should [[pray]] as soon as it is safe to. Note that for one [[turn]] after a [[werecreature]]'s transformation to animal form, it will ignore [[Elbereth]], giving it an opportunity to infect you.

These [[monster]]s require special precautions but are not especially dangerous if handled correctly.
* The three starting [[pet]] types and their stronger forms: {{brown|u}} [[horse]]s, {{white|d}} [[dog]]s, and {{white|f}} [[cat]]s: All of these species are much faster than you and have strong attacks. They can be tamed by throwing [[food]] they like at them (they will eat it) or pacified by throwing any other type of [[food]]. You might consider saving some [[tripe ration|tripe]] (for cats and dogs) and produce (for horses), but even a [[food ration]] or [[tin]] will make them stop killing you. [[Egg]]s, [[melon]]s, and [[cream pie]]s will usually be destroyed by throwing them, preventing them from taming or pacifying your target. See [[diet]] for details. As usual, they respect [[Elbereth]].
* {{monsymlink|floating eye}}: Floating eyes are very slow and cannot directly damage you. They are still very dangerous due to their [[passive attack]]&mdash;should you fight them in melee, you will often be [[paralysis|paralyzed]] for several hundred [[turn]]s, during which you are a sitting duck. Attack them with ranged weapons or apply a [[polearm]], or simply ignore them. If they leave a [[corpse]], be sure to eat it, as [[intrinsic telepathy]] is valuable.
* {{mcsl|m}} [[Mimic]]s: the {{monsymlink|small mimic}}, {{monsymlink|large mimic}}, and {{monsymlink|giant mimic}}: Pose as items in [[shop]]s and kill unsuspecting players. They hit very hard and can [[grabbing attack#sticky_attack|grab onto you]] but move very slowly. [[Elbereth]] is very useful against one that grabs you. See the [[mimic#Strategy|mimic page]] for more advice.

==The midgame==
In the middle phase of the game, survival is less of a pressure and the game is about completing an [[ascension kit]]. The distinction between early game and midgame isn't clear. Depending on who is defining it, the transition point may be reaching [[Sokoban]] and [[Minetown]], collecting the [[Sokoban]] prize, or the point at which you no longer fear [[ant|team a]]. The floors between the [[Quest]] portal and the [[Castle]] are almost certainly midgame territory.

===Midgame threats===
* {{monsymlink|lich}} and {{monsymlink|demilich}}: These [[undead]] monstrosities are likely to be the first truly threatening [[monster spells#mage_spells|spellcasting monsters]] the player encounters. Normal liches are relatively slow, but have a toolbox of spells allowing them to [[drain strength|lower your strength]], [[curse items|curse your items]], [[destroy armor|destroy your precious armor]], even [[summon nasties]], and high level demiliches can even cast [[touch of death]]. Demiliches are also faster. [[Elbereth]] can prevent them from touching you or using their worst spells on you, and it is therefore highly recommended. Blessed [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]] are often used on liches, and has the benefit of also annihilating their stronger cousins, [[master lich|master]] and [[arch-lich]]es which cast the same set of spells but are more likely to be high enough level to use the monster dangerous ones, [[summon nasties]] and [[touch of death]].
* {{monsymlink|mind flayer}} and {{monsymlink|master mind flayer}}: These flying abominations are not spellcasters, but instead have the ability to suck your brain. This attack drains your [[attribute|intelligence]], and can also cause you to [[amnesia|forget object identities and level layouts]]. If they reduce you to below 3 [[intelligence]], you will die instantly and cannot be saved even with an [[amulet of life saving]]. Attack them from range whenever possible; if you must fight them in melee, wear a (preferably [[greased]]) helmet and use [[Elbereth]] religiously. If they are within one [[turn]]'s movement of you you should engrave [[Elbereth]] with a guaranteed one turn source, e.g. a [[wand of fire]] or an [[athame]]. After they are dead, you can use a [[unicorn horn]] to restore your [[intelligence]], but you will not recover lost object identities or level maps. [[Genocide]] is also popular here, but beware: if you are a [[dwarf]], blessed-genociding 'h' will [[instadeath|instantly kill you]].
* {{monsymlink|titan}}: While normally quite rare, one variant of [[Medusa's Island]] contains a guaranteed titan near the up [[staircase]]. They are almost always [[peaceful]] to [[lawful]] characters, but [[neutral]] and [[chaotic]] characters are out of luck. They are probably the first monster you will encounter capable of casting [[summon nasties]], and worse, they are immune to [[genocide]]. They respect [[Elbereth]], but be wary as several of their summoned minions ignore it.
* {{monclasssym|;}} [[Sea monster]]s: Two sea monsters in particular, the {{cyan|;}} [[giant eel]] and the {{blue|;}} [[electric eel]], possess a two-move [[drowning attack]] that [[instadeath|kills you instantly]]. The move will fail if you wear a [[greased]] or [[oilskin cloak]], however. If you lack either, be adjacent to [[moat|water]] as little as possible. Electric eels can also destroy your [[ring]]s with their electrical attacks&mdash;including a worn [[ring of levitation]]. They are sometimes [[genocide]]d, but less commonly than the previous two monster types. Eels and [[shark]]s are guaranteed around [[Medusa's island]] and in the [[Castle]] moat. They will appear in [[special room#swamp|swamps]] as well, but those are rather rare. {{monsymlink|Kraken}}s, {{monsymlink|couatl}}s, and {{monsymlink|python}}s are also capable of drowning you, but krakens are slow and couatls and pythons rarely near water.
* {{monsymlink|chickatrice}} and {{monsymlink|cockatrice}}: These monsters are possibly the most complex monsters in the game; it is important to understand what will and what will not [[stoning|petrify]] you. The main article goes into detail, but the gist is that touching a cockatrice, living or dead, in any way, will kill you instantly. If [[gloves]] are worn, they can be touched with your [[hands]], but beware of [[Cockatrice#Use as a weapon|wielding their corpse]]&mdash;should you fall in a [[pit]] or down a [[staircase]], you will touch it no matter what you wear. Should you begin to stiffen from their hiss, eat a [[lizard]] or [[acid|acidic corpse]], cast {{spell of|stone to flesh}} at yourself, or quaff a [[potion of acid]] posthaste; if no other option is available, [[pray]]. With correct precautions, they become less dangerous and more of a powerful weapon. Just beware of leaving them on the floor, in case you walk over it while [[blind]]ed or have it used against you by an [[intelligent monster|intelligent]] foe.
* {{monsymlink|rust monster}}: These monsters can be unbelievably irritating. Both their main attacks and their [[passive attack]] will cause [[metal]] items to [[erosion|rust]], reducing their effectiveness. They will also eat any [[metal]] items they find, including good items you may have wanted to obtain. If they are alone, you can simply punch them to death while wearing no [[metal]] [[armor]] uncovered by a cloak; they can do no physical damage. If not alone, use the almighty [[Elbereth|E-Word]] or zap them with [[wand]]s and spells. A [[unicorn horn]] is a good weapon here too.
* {{monsymlink|minotaur}}: These monsters ignore [[Elbereth]] and have very high damage, but they also have no [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]]. They are generated by the [[summon nasties]] spell and can be created inside any [[maze]]. They will not normally appear before late game, but the [[Castle]] contains a small piece of [[maze]] and there can be up to 3 complete [[maze]] levels between [[Medusa's Island]] and the [[Castle]], giving you plenty of chances to meet them early. A minotaur at the [[Castle]] is particularly dangerous because the [[maze]] is so small; if it appears there you are usually forced to fight it.
* [[wand_of_death|Wands of Death]]: Attack wands are always something to be worried about until you get [[reflection]] or [[magic resistance]], but once you're past the early game, the danger becomes much more serious: level 8+ intelligent monsters can generate with this wand as an offensive item. If you still don't have reflection and magic resistance after clearing Sokoban and [[Mine's End]], it may be worth going out of your way to get protection from this wand. Possible strategies include:
** Blessing and using [[magic_lamp|magic lamps]] and [[Smoky_and_milky_potions|smoky potions]], sitting on [[throne|thrones]], and using [[fountains]] on early floors for a chance to wish for reflection or magic resistance;
** Diving down to [[Medusa%27s Island]] for the possible [[shield of reflection]] in the statue of Perseus;
** Diving down to the [[castle]] to get the [[wand of wishing]];
** Finishing the [[quest]] as soon as possible to get reflection or magic resistance from your [[quest artifact]] (varies by role and [[quest nemesis]] difficulty);
** Obtaining [[polymorph control]] and a way to [[polymorph]] yourself so you can turn into an [[undead]] creature to become immune to wands of death.<!--(The [[Potion_of_blood#Potion_of_Vampire_Blood|potions of vampire blood]] added in [[SLASH%27EM]] and [[UnNetHack]] make this much simpler, offering a guaranteed polymorph into a {{monsymlink|vampire}}, which is not only undead, but can also wear all armor and has intrinsic [[regeneration]], a [[Drain_life|life-draining]] bite, and the ability to [[fly]]. [[Vampire_(starting_race)|Players that start as vampires]], of course, don't have to worry about wands of death to begin with.)-->
** Until you're protected from the wand of death, you may want to take extra care around monsters that are eligible for it: stay out of zapping range until you can attack, get powerful weapons to kill them quickly, and have a means of [[teleportation]], [[sleep]], or [[paralysis]] on hand in case you find out a monster has a wand of death (and you are still alive to worry about it). The most common monsters you will encounter at this stage that are eligible for the wand of death include {{brown|T}} [[trolls]], {{brown|O}} [[ogres]], {{gray|H}} [[giants]], {{green|@}} [[elves]], and members of {{gray|@}} [[Yendorian_army|the Yendorian army]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes. Alternatives include [[Potion of restore ability|potions of restore ability]], the [[Spellbook of restore ability|restore ability spell]], [[prayer]], or [[gain ability]].}}

==The late game==
In the late game, survival is almost guaranteed (bar those [[YASD]]s that an [[amulet of life saving]] could have saved you from), and the goal is to get the [[Amulet of Yendor]] and resurface. The late game is generally said to start either when you get the [[wand of wishing]] from the [[Castle]], or when you begin exploring [[Gehennom]]; some players in some roles (e.g., [[Samurai]]) usually do the [[Quest]] after the [[Castle]].

===Late game threats===
* [[YASD]]: Most deaths here are either through player error or handling difficult [[conduct]]s.
** {{monsymlink|minotaur}}: If something is going to kill you in melee, this is it.
** {{monsymlink|mind flayer}} and {{monsymlink|master mind flayer}}: Amnesia is still a substantial setback, and a brainless death is still possible. And remember that unlike most of the post-[[Castle]] blunders you could make, all the [[amulets of life saving]] in the world won't save you from brainlessness.
** {{monsymlink|green slime}}: Not especially dangerous, but (rarely) being touched by them or (definitely) eating them can start a long [[delayed_instadeath|delayed instadeath]] ([[sliming]]) curable by [[fire]]. Be aware that they exist.
** {{monsymlink|Juiblex}}: A [[major demon]] who inhabits [[Juiblex's swamp|his own swamp]], guaranteed to appear in [[Gehennom]]. He is easy to kill but will almost surely infect you with a deadly [[sickness]] at least once, which you must remember to cure with your [[unicorn horn]].
** {{monsymlink|Demogorgon}}: Not guaranteed to appear (in [[vanilla]]), but can ruin an ascension run if you're not prepared; he's quite nasty. Read his article for tips.
** {{monsymlink|chickatrice}} and {{monsymlink|cockatrice}}: A monster wielding a cockatrice corpse is one of the few truly frightening things at this point, and the cockatrice itself presents many possible [[YASD]]s.
** {{monsymlink|master lich}} and {{monsymlink|arch-lich}}: These purple Ls will begin appearing frequently in [[Gehennom]]. They are stronger than the [[lich]] and demilich. They are also [[covetous]], giving them the ability to teleport back and forth between you and the [[staircase|upstairs]] where they will heal. They have a much higher [[magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] and base level, practically guaranteeing that they can cast their full repertoire of spells.

==The [[ascension run]]==
Finally, on the run your final death is a (slim) possibility again while racing to [[ascension|ascend]]. Your character is likely fully equipped and very strong, but there are a few things to worry about. This stage of the game begins by recovering the [[Book of the Dead]].

It's worth noting that most players treat "end game" as a synonym for "[[ascension run]]", but [[NetHack]] itself reserves the title "End Game" for the [[Elemental Planes]] and the [[Astral Plane]] (though it uses "Elemental Planes" internally for the [[Astral Plane]] as well as [[Elemental Planes|the other four planes]]). Most players refer to those as just "the Planes". The terminology is a tad hazy.

===[[Ascension run]] threats===
* The same warnings about [[YASD]]s from the late game apply here, but with a few additional notes.
* The [[Riders]]: {{monsymlink|Famine}}, {{monsymlink|Pestilence}}, {{monsymlink|Death}}: Unique monsters you will meet on the Astral plane. Read up on them.
* {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor}}: The Wizard will return from the dead an infinite number of times, and will not stop appearing until you reach the [[Astral plane]]. Even while dead he will [[Wizard of Yendor#Harassment|strike out at you]].
* {{monsymlink|air elemental}}: On the [[Plane of Air]], Air Elementals are substantially stronger than in the rest of the game, and can rapidly kill characters with a subpar [[Armor Class]]. It can help to have some quick method of defeating or neutralizing them.
* {{monsymlink|mind flayer}} and {{monsymlink|master mind flayer}}: If you get amnesiaed now you will have to remap the levels you lost with [[The Wizard of Yendor]] on your tail.
* {{yellow|%}} [[Cockatrice]] corpses: These are a common choice on the ascension run, especially on the [[Astral Plane]]; as always, be careful with them.
* The [[Astral Plane]], the last level in the game, is by far the place where most ascension run deaths take place. Move slow and play carefully. Request the help of the players in [[Libera|#nethack]] if you need it. [[Player monster]]s in particular may spawn with [[Vorpal Blade]] if it hasn't been generated yet, and can use that to kill you instantly with a 5% chance.

'''Baby dragons''' are a subset of [[dragon]]s that appear in ''[[NetHack]]''. All baby dragons are neutral, huge-sized, [[strong]], and capable of [[flight]]. They have an [[AC]] of 2 and possess intrinsic resistances similar to their adult forms, but lack the adults' scales (along with the AC and resistances those would convey),{{refsrc|muse.c|2141|nethack=3.6.1}} their ability to use breath weapons, and the ability to [[see invisible]]. They are also [[intelligent]] and [[gold lover|can pick up gold]] and gems, but have no hands.

Baby dragons are eligible choices for steeds. Despite their strength and size, they cannot easily tear through [[web]]s.{{refsrc|trap.c|2039|comment=extra_nasty() discerns adult dragons from baby dragons to let them tear through webs}}

The baby dragons present in ''[[NetHack]]'' are:
* {{monsymlink|baby gray dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby silver dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby red dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby white dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby orange dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby black dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby blue dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby green dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby yellow dragon}}

The [[baby shimmering dragon]], {{monsym|baby shimmering dragon}}, exists in the game's code, but is [[Deferred feature|commented out]].

==Generation==
Baby dragons are only generated randomly and at level creation on floors that they are eligible for, i.e., the neutral-biased [[Oracle]] and [[Sokoban]] levels and the lawful-biased [[Gnomish mines]]; they are excluded from the selection of random {{white|D}} in levels that place them during initial creation. Like all baby monsters, they can also be hatched from dragon [[egg]]s, and [[grow up]] into their scaled adult forms.

Baby yellow dragons and yellow dragon eggs appear on the fourth variant of Medusa's Island, under the care of a mother [[yellow dragon]].

==Strategy==
Baby dragons have decent AC and a somewhat nasty bite, but are otherwise not much threat for a prepared player encountering them.

Obtaining pet baby dragons can easily be accomplished via controlled [[polymorph]] for female characters: all dragons are [[oviparous]], and baby dragons that hatch from your [[sit|laid]] eggs will always be tame. A male character can use an [[amulet of change]] to swap genders, or he can repeatedly polymorph into a dragon using the [[spellbook of polymorph|spell]] or [[ring of polymorph|ring]] until he changes sex.{{refsrc|polyself.c|488}}

===As pets===
Pet baby dragons are decent fighters, but can take quite a while to raise due to their low speed. They can be used as [[riding|steeds]], with the advantages of flight, fighting strength, and carnivorousness, which makes them easy to feed. However, their lack of speed ensures they will spend most of their time either catching up with you or eating [[corpse]]s; even after making them [[fast]] (e.g., by zapping a [[wand of speed monster]] at them) and raising them to adulthood, their movement speed still pales in comparison to many other available steeds, though the flight and the breath weapon they gain may still make them a worthwhile choice. Players planning to make frequent use of dragon pets or steeds may want to carry a [[magic whistle]].

While baby dragons do not confer scales and/or resistances of any kind, tame baby dragons will eventually [[grow up]] into their adult forms, which can then be killed (possibly via [[conflict]] or by rendering them non-tame through [[abuse]]) for their scales and intrinsics.

==History==
[[NetHack 3.0.0]] introduces baby dragons and distinguishes between and their corpses by color, as well as those of the adult forms.

[[NetHack 3.3.0]] adds the baby silver dragon and its adult form, along with silver dragon scales.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although
preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction
and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous
undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend
not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire
breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail,
the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
{{right-align|[ Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]}}

"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a
dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's
not a trick of mastering the dragons, as most people think.
Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with
a dragon:  will he talk to you or will he eat you?  If you can
count upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why
then you're a dragonlord."
{{right-align|[ The Tombs of Atuan, by Ursula K. Le Guin ]}}

It was so large that it had to be removed from the database because Rodney would become unresponsive to everyone else whenever someone requested the entry. For a while it was hosted by [[GreyKnight]], but now that the wiki exists we can put it where it really belongs. So here they are, loosely sorted by dungeon branch. [[File:You_die....png|frame|You die...(again)]]

Some of the lessons don't apply to post-[[3.4.3]] versions of NetHack, but may still apply to variants based on older versions.

== The lessons ==
===[[Dungeons of Doom]]===
* Don't try to cancel your own spellcasting by pressing Escape, especially when polypiling. Skipping the direction prompt releases the magic power to the previously used direction!
* When you get a blessed [[scroll of genocide]], @ means you, even when you aren't a human.
** Commentary: Besides, many important @ monsters (such as [[shopkeepers]]) can't be genocided anyway.
* A blessed scroll of genocide will wipe out all species in a monster class, even if you explicitly specify a single species. Don't try to use one to genocide (master) mind flayers if you're a dwarf.
* Sleep rays bounce, and elves don't start with sleep resistance.
* "Huh. Didn't know a [[bag of tricks]] would explode a [[bag of holding]]."
* You have to really be INSIDE a temple for sanctuary to work. The door isn't good enough.
** Commentary: Unless the monsters are inside the temple too.
*** ...in which case they'll just flee from you, though they'll still try to use ranged attacks.
* Don't wear [[levitation]] items until you need them. They deprive you of [[Elbereth]] and other useful escapes.
* Don't panic. Always know where your [[towel]] is.
* Be very careful with uncontrolled [[teleportitis]] and [[quantum mechanic]]s in stores!
** Commentary: [[Teleportitis#Shopping with uncontrolled teleportitis|Drop your gold first.]]
* Never eat [[tin]]s in shops whilst wielding potentially expensive [[artifact]]s. Also don't let [[nymph]]s get near you.
** Commentary: Doubly true if you're in the [[black market]].
* Remember, "Thou shalt not worship graven images"
* Never sacrifice something you can't touch! Attempting to lure a [[cockatrice]] onto an [[altar]] for sacrifice with the idea that you can do so without touching it will cause you to develop a stony appearance without the chance to eat a [[lizard]].
* Don't carry [[wand]]s/[[scroll]]s/[[potion]]s outside bags. Nothing like standing on the [[vibrating square]] with the [[Bell of Opening]] (0:0), complaining about exploding [[wand of cancellation]] and [[wand of wishing]] and not having a [[scroll of charging]] handy, or losing that brand new, unused wand of wishing to an [[electric eel]].
** Commentary: Or at least minimize the vulnerable [[item]]s you have out. It is worth risking a few [[escape item]]s to have them ready when you really need them.
** Also you better be sure you've identified the [[wand of cancellation]] before you accidentally put one in a [[bag of holding]].
* If you have crappy ISP, NEVER reconnect to server right after you got your Internet connection back. There can still be some glitches with it.
* NetHack doesn't know about arrows/function/home/end/page up/page down keys and treats them as escape. Therefore '''don't try to edit your [[wish]]es with them.'''
** Commentary: NetHack 3.6 lets you clear the input with escape, as did [[NAO]] before.
* NEVER leave [[fragile]] items (such as potions) unattended when there are intelligent foes around. [[Wand of striking]] == BOOM!
* NEVER skip messages with space. Ever. Especially when handling petrifying monsters.
* When you have a laggy connection, NEVER type the next command before you see how the previous one ended.
* When running from a nasty monster, go back the way you came.
* Be careful of what items are marked as 'y' and 'n' in your inventory to avoid confusion with yes/no prompts. For example, trying to eat something on the ground while [[levitating]] by typing 'ey' quickly will have disastrous effects if your inventory contains 'y - a [[cockatrice corpse]]'.
** Commentary: Watch out in the [[spell]]s menu too; double tapping "y" and casting a spell without seeing which one it was could put you in an interesting predicament. Was it [[spellbook of finger of death|FOD]]? [[spellbook of polymorph|Poly]]? Or maybe {{spell of|extra healing}}?
* Be careful of what items are marked as direction-moving keys in your inventory, in case you miss a key, so instead of 'ahky' (apply h-a key north Unlock the door? yes) you hit 'aky' (apply k-a wand of cancellation Really break your wand of cancellation? yes)
* When hiding in a [[shop]] to recover [[HP]], make sure to [[rest]] instead of [[search]] to avoid finding (and waking) [[mimic]]s.
* Make sure comestibles (esp. [[rubber chicken]]s) aren't assigned 'e', wands aren't assigned 'z' or 'a', potions aren't assigned 'q', scrolls and spellbooks aren't assigned 'r', tools aren't assigned 'a', weapons that might be cursed aren't assigned 'w', armor that might be cursed isn't assigned 'W', rings that might be cursed aren't assigned 'P', etc.
* When the ground around you looks the same except for being a different color, examine it with [[what_is|/]] or [[;]] before stepping there.
* Don't try to polymorph a merely annoying monster just to get it out of your way; save your charges (or mana) for things that are just about to kill you, since the creature it becomes might be something deadly. (StormEagle, [[blue jelly]] => [[ice devil]]; nabru, [[wood nymph]] => [[demilich]] and [[floating eye]] => [[Aleax]]).
* If you [[levelport]], angry shopkeepers are somehow able to levelport with you.
** Commentary: Because they are [[follower]]s like pets and most human monsters. Make sure you get some distance between you and the angry shopkeep before attempting to levelport.
* There is a vital difference between '<[[god]]> is displeased' due to praying too soon, and praying on the wrong altar or with negative [[luck]]/[[alignment]]. Only the first one makes your god [[angry]].
** Commentary: Is this really true? Also, a water prayer on a cross-aligned altar will make your god angry.
* If you are being held/crushed by an [[owlbear]], zapping down with a [[wand of digging]] is not as effective as you might think. Engrave [[Elbereth]] with it instead...
* If you leave [[skeleton key]]s (but not [[lock pick]]s or [[credit card]]s) lying around, monsters that can open doors are smart enough to pick them up and unlock doors with them.
* For beginners: if your HP shows as yellow or red (with the [[Statuscolors|statuscolors patch]]), you have the [[spell of healing]] and you have enough power to cast it, do so. You'll never know which [[gnome]] has the [[wand of lightning]]/[[wand of cold|cold]]/[[wand of fire|fire]].
**Commentary: Of course, if said [[gnome]] [[GWTWOD|happens to have a]] [[wand of death]] it won't matter anyway.
* If you're trying for #conduct weaponless, just leave pick-axes on the ground. Don't even bother to put them in your BoH. Use wands of digging instead (which are not wielded). If you're going for #conduct pacifist, wield a cream pie and never let go. Rely on 5 to move.  
**Commentary: (Unless VERY careful: this means thinking for 5 seconds before every move.) You can remap the movement keys to use {{kbd|5}} or {{kbd|m}} to cut down on accidents.
* Never underestimate a [[bones]] level.
* Get a second or third opinion. ALWAYS.
* Don't stone-to-flesh statues from a bones file. They are likely to be well-armed and armored.
* If a [[zombie]] of your race dies on your [[altar]] during a sacfest, move the human corpse away ''before'' trying to sacrifice anything.
** Commentary: Rotted corpses still anger [[gods]].
* Don't just try on unidentified rings if you're near a priest or any other friendly "@". If that ring turns out to be [[conflict]], you won't live to regret it.
** Commentary: Unless you know it isn't conflict. Other powerful or threatening peaceful monsters, not just "@", are also to be avoided, though trying on an unidentified [[ring]] near a weak peaceful monster is a good way to identify conflict. Also, priests will wield their weapons before attacking; you can watch for this from a safe distance and take the ring off as soon as they do.
* Locking a door will not do much if you leave a pick axe or mattock immediately outside it.
** In NetHack 3.4.3, engrave [[Elbereth]] under the pick, since all digging monsters respect that.
* When attacking a [[gas spore]], make sure your pet isn't within the range of the explosion when the spore dies. It will count as if you killed the pet.
** Commentary: Unless your [[pet]] can survive the 4d6. This also applies to aligned priests&mdash;losing the only co-aligned temple in your entire dungeon is a real bummer.
* Don't try to polymorph at experience level 1 or 2, unless you like being killed by unsuccessful polymorphs.
** Commentary: The [[polyself bug]] was one reason you might actually want to do this.
* Don't zap your kitten with a wand of polymorph.  It may die from [[system shock]] and you will have killed it.
** Commentary: Prefer a [[polymorph trap]]&mdash;it will not kill, and you can retry indefinitely.
* Before you kick in a locked door, make sure it's not attached to a [[shop]], lest you anger the shopkeeper.
** Commentary: Check for the "Closed for inventory" engraving (in dust) outside the [[door]]. Unlocking the door is okay though, and open shops (even empty ones) never close.
** Note, this means you must never kick down any doors while blind unless you already know they are not shop doors!
* When waiting for monsters to show up and force you back into human form, don't wander away from your only weapon just because you couldn't carry it.
** Commentary: Try throwing that weapon upwards.
* When in a zoo, fight [[shrieker]]s and [[gas spore]]s last.
** Commentary: If you can avoid killing them, [[yellow light]]s, [[black light]]s, [[freezing sphere]]s, [[flaming sphere]]s, and [[shocking sphere]]s should also be left for last. Never kick down treasure zoo doors, else ''every'' monster inside will wake up (unless you plan on using conflict or something).
* Pause every time you see a monster. Watching the contents of your inventory, or what you are [[polymorph]]ed into, is free. Thinking of a tactic is also free. Going toe-to-toe with a [[footrice]] when you're poly'd into a [[master mind flayer]] is priceless.
* [[Werecreatures]] are considered [[human]]. Sacrificing werecreatures is a good idea only if you are chaotic or playing an elf/orc/dwarf/gnome.
** Commentary:  Werecreatures return to human form upon death in [[SLASH'EM]].
** Moreover, [[doppelganger]]s are considered human, too. 
* [[Chameleon]]s leave brown corpses. They can also impersonate monsters which leave brown corpses.
* If you're confused in a shop and standing next to the shopkeeper with your very promising character, keep doing nothing for as long as it takes. Yes I know it's only a 1 in 8 chance. Yes it will kill you. [[Stun]]ing is even worse.
** Commentary: The same may happen for blind characters without telepathy. The {{kbd|m}} prefix to [[movement]] commands is only safe if you can detect the shopkeeper, even as {{white|I}}&mdash;you will say "Pardon me" instead of attacking.
* A [[bugle]] is not a good tool for a [[knight]] to use to wake sleeping monsters&mdash;especially in [[Minetown]].
** Commentary: Bugling in Minetown is not recommended for any other role, either, if any of the watch are still alive.
* Never use force bolt in a level with a shop ([[you hear the chime of a cash register]]) if you haven't explored the area in the direction you're shooting if you can't pay for broken things, unless you can fight the shopkeeper.
* Engraving with wands is useful. If you get the message "The bugs on the floor stop moving!", more often than not, it will be a wand of sleep, but rarely it can be a wand of death. Don't zap it at walls that can reflect back to you. It will be that wand of death.
** Commentary: All walls reflect [[ray]]s. Death and sleep can be distinguished via price-ID. Also, even if it isn't, putting yourself to sleep is quite dangerous too&mdash;allowing yourself to possibly get hit by the wand is only safe if you have [[reflection]] or can deal with both effects.
** Commentary: In a nutshell, when reflection is involved, don't dish out what you can't take.
* Do not pray on an cross-aligned altar when you are starving. You stomach won't change, but your prayer timeout will.
* When you accidentally get [[water moccasin]]s from a fountain, run. Don't fight, run.
** Commentary: Unless you deliberately drank from the fountain because you were hungry for a snack of fresh water moccasin and are capable of preparing that dish. Ordinary [[snakes]] are functionally identical to water moccasins (but moccasins always appear in groups).
* Go ahead - leave [[autopickup]] on. It's handy until you walk over that [[footrice]] corpse without gloves.
** Configuring [[pickup_types]] or better yet [[autopickup exception]]s gives you the best of both worlds.
* Don't fight the [[Soldier ant]] fairly. Just don't.
* In NetHackW (graphical version) please remember to turn off auto-pickup. It's nice until you find a statue. You wonder why you can't pick up anything when ''You see here 57 gold coins. There is nothing here to pick up.'' Or ''You see here a statue. You can barely move a hand's reach with this load!''
** Commentary: Or set pickup_types, or [[pickup_burden]]. Or compile in and set autopickup exceptions.
* Be sure to identify wands before zapping them at enemies, especially if you're zapping an unknown wand of make invisible at a nymph!
* For crying out loud, don't kick down doors if they have an engraving in front of them! Even if it's ''??o?? f? I???t???''.
** Commentary: A bones level may have a pre-eroded engraving. Or you may have stepped on it and not noticed.
* If you find a dead end, don't hold down '''s'''. It'll just make things worse if you encounter a monster and are still searching.
** Commentary: Use a [[numeric prefix]] instead, like n10s or just 10s if using vikeys.
* When you find a small mimic in a shop, be sure to attack it, not the shopkeeper! There's no way to say that you meant to hit the mimic!
* Similarly, when attacking a mimic with wands or spells, check your rebound path every single time. The shopkeeper does not stand still while you're fighting.
* When playing NAO, if you get lag, don't just keep pressing buttons; once the prompt has stopped lagging, I guarantee you will have the message, ''"Do you want your possessions identified? [yn](n)"''
* If you're multi-tasking with NetHack, be sure you're in the chat box with your friend(s) and not still on the NetHack command prompt. "r u playing nethack again?" yes ('''y''': ''Unknown extended command'' '''e''': ''What do you want to eat? [acdsR-?*]'' '''s''': ''A cockatrice corpse. Do you want your possessions identified?'')
* Engraving with your fingers in the dust is fine unless your Elbereth happens to be E'''¦'''bereth.
** Commentary: Always, always check your writing with {{kbd|:}} (but not if you are blind, in which case that will use a turn).
* Just because you survived that rolling boulder trap DOES NOT mean you or your pet will survive it again.
* If you fall through a trap door into a vault without a pickaxe or wand of digging, don't keep saying that your name is Croesus; the vault doesn't have a kitchen, refrigerator, or any other type of food producing place that you'd find in your house.
* When casting force bolt, be sure that there are no pets, shopkeepers, guards, etc. behind what you're hitting. Or nymphs &mdash; you'll break their (likely) potion of object detection and incur a loss of luck.
** Commentary: You're thinking of a [[mirror]], which they also carry often.
* Don't put every single damn piece of armor, gloves, or shoes you find on! Sure they might not be cursed, but when you do put them on, they'll be cursed. Every single time!
** Commentary: Unless you have the spell of remove curse and enough power. Try pet-testing also.
* Make sure to remove that [[ring of conflict]] you might be wearing before you enter a shop.
* Eating a chickatrice corpse does not make you petrification resistant.
* If you're kicking things off traps, make sure you aren't low on HP, and are strong.
* Even if you happen to be wearing a ring of polymorph control, don't try to polymorph (quaffing sinks ...) when you are a low level (like XL1) - you risk death from [[system shock]] or from level drain after feeling like a new man/elf/orc.
** Commentary: Polymorph control protects you from system shock, but you still have a 8% chance of fatal level drain.
* So wait, I'm NOT supposed to use that fireball scroll while hallucinating?
* Don't eat eggs unless you're sure of what's in them. Just because you haven't seen any cockatrices yet doesn't mean the egg is safe.
* Don't bang on the keyboard, you'll just be angrier.
* And don't rest on the keyboard as well!
* Have a laptop? Move carefully!
* Attacking a floating eye isn't fatal... unless there might be a powerful monster nearby...
** Commentary: If you attack a floating eye, there is invariably a powerful monster nearby. When you're paralyzed, a [[newt]] can be considered a powerful monster.
* Collecting useful items from bones files is great! Reading/Using anything immediately after isn't.
** Commentary: Determine [[BUC]] first.
* Yes, pressing any directional key counts as 1 turn, no matter what! (Except for trying to move into a wall or solid rock.)
* Just because your laptop doesn't have a numpad, doesn't mean you can't move diagonally. Then again, normal numbers hate laptops that play NetHack. Especially if you're confused.
* Don't try to play 2 NetHack games at the same time. Just don't.
* If you're listening to music while playing NetHack, don't, don't, '''DON'T '''press buttons (especially directional keys) to your music; you'll miss your YASD.
* In SLASH'EM as an ice or flame mage, don't youpoly into a dragon when you are wearing armor. Unlike lycanthropes and doppelgangers, you will break out of it. And unlike regular polymorphs into them, your dragon scale mail is not preserved.
* Don't even try to read spell books at level 1.
** Commentary: [[Wizard]]s will get a warning if the book is too hard, so long as it isn't cursed. Blessed books are safe.
* Remember, [[far look|look]], don't [[Direction|touch]]!
* Organized pack helps.  a - primary weapon, d - pick axe, g - unicorn horn, etc.  Arrange to taste.
* After clearing a screenful of monsters involving c, leave for a few hundred tics, to let the corpses expire.
** Commentary: Or pick all of them up and use for yourself or safely put away&mdash;but be sure you're wearing gloves! Corpses almost always rot after 250 turns.
* Finding a blindfold from a [[bones]] file while having intrinsic [[telepathy]] is great! Now don't get all excited and immediately after just to "try it out", because you'll be "trying it out" much longer that you'd like.
* Get greedy, get killed.
* If your spells spill over onto a second page, make sure that {{spell of|healing}} and {{spell of|finger of death}} aren't represented by the same letter.
* Be careful when BUC-testing items with a [[leash]]ed [[pet]]. You won't necessarily get the "<Pet> moves only reluctantly" message--very bad if you then put on a cursed [[ring of conflict]] with no known [[Potion of holy water|method]] [[Scroll of remove curse|of]] [[Spellbook of remove curse|removing]] [[Wand of cancellation|curses]] [[Spellbook of cancellation|handy]].
* NetHack is a good patience detector. Hurry equals death. Which can also be fun actually, if you don't mind not ascending
* NEVER use a figurine of a monster that might be strong enough to kill you without curse-testing it, unless desperate. (And even if it is uncursed or blessed, there's still that 10% chance ...)
* ^S (control + S), in some *nix shells, suspends output to your screen. Your keystrokes will go through, but the results won't be displayed yet. ^Q un-suspends it. ^I is an invalid command that happens to also be the tab key, if you want to test a "frozen" terminal, press this. Then try ^Q. DO NOT SPAM KEYS. You will, upon resuming your session, or killing your session and starting a new one--whether because it really is frozen or because you didn't know about traditional terminal flow control--that you have died.
** To disable XON/XOFF flow control in a *nix terminal, run <code>stty -ixon</code> from a shell prompt.
* Just because you found a [[wand of wishing]] on DL 8 doesn't mean that a [[spotted jelly]] can't hurt you.
* Pets are not invincible!
* Be sure you know the distinction between the lowercase o and capital O in your inventory. Bad things can happen...very bad things...
* Cockatrices are very dangerous creatures. In every way.
* If you see something like [[Vault|"a? ae??r|um"]] in front of a door, don't open the door if you don't have teleportation control. Okay, fine, you can open it, but don't go in unless you're carrying pocket change at most, want to #occupy [[Fort Ludios]], or are willing to lie about your name.
** Commentary:  If you've got enough food to wait a few turns, it's fine.  Just drop your gold before you go in.  Let the guard show you out, and now you know exactly where the vault is, for easy digging later when you find a pick.
* Eating killer bee corpses is a bad idea, unless you're going for some sort of low-strength conduct.
** But if you have [[poison resistance]] from a ring or amulet, or a [[unicorn horn]] (in 3.6.6 and earlier versions), this can be a quick and easy way to get intrinsic poison resistance.
* Praying to recover your HP? Don't do it unless your HP falls below max/5 at levels 1-6 (or below 6 HP), max/6 at levels 6-13, max/7 at levels 14-21.  Otherwise, you're screwed.
* If you're not sure if a corpse is spoiled yet, DON'T eat it. Otherwise the next word you see may be [[Food poisoning|the eight-letter F-word]].
* Be wary if you have poor eyesight. If you see a blue, round-looking letter, look at it closely before you move next to it or else [[Floating eye|I guarantee you'll see lots of messages culminating in "You die..."]]
** Commentary: Watch out for [[soldier ant]]s as well, which also are blue, round-looking, [[YASD|and will likely ruin your day]].
* Dwarven Valkyries and Human Tourists are VERY different.
* Don't dip for Excalibur if you aren't equipped for some [[water demon|possible]] [[water moccasin|nasty]] [[water nymph|surprises]]!
* Don't dip for Excalibur if there aren't enough fountains around. Fountains can dry up; you don't want to run around searching for another one with a cursed thoroughly rusted long sword.
* Don't eat during combat situations if you can avoid it. There's always the chance that you'll be knocked out for several turns by rotten food.
* If your monk gets an uncursed scroll of genocide, do NOT misspell "master mind flayer". The slightest error will cause YASD, and [[lifesaving]] won't protect you. Yes, that also applies if you write "master mindflayer".
** 'mindflayer' is now recognised as of [[NetHack 3.6.0]].
* Don't read random unidentified scrolls while confused unless you're absolutely sure they're [[reverse genocide|cursed]] or you've identified genocide already!
* If you got a dragon scale mail from wish, and a wand of polymorph, and you encountered a dangerous monster (ex. water demon), why don't you zap yourself?
** Commentary: Your [[cloak]] will rip, and your mail will revert to scales.
* [[BUC|BUC-testing]] potions at an [[altar]] while levitating will result in acrimony and broken glass.
* Make sure there is no co-aligned priest in the firing line before zapping [[Speed monster]] at your pet.  This will anger the priest and you won't be able to enter his temple without being attacked.
** If you manage to escape, don't return to that level with uncontrolled [[teleportitis]] as the RNG will teleport you into his temple and he will kill you.
* When playing with number_pad off, be careful when going northwest. "Really attack Izchak?"
* Beware the hallucinating pet arch-lich. (Make sure that that black light over there blows up in your face and not your pet's.)
* Don't eat [[wraith]] corpses when [[satiated]]. You don't get a warning.
** This also goes for [[tin]]s and [[meatballs]].
* If you just spent a year extincting/genociding everything and then [[polypiling]] gems, hauling them to the first floor, trying for hours to get your [[giant]]s arranged around the upstair, and [[Wizard of Yendor|Rodney]] comes... for the love of God, don't quaff the [[potion of gain level]] he may drop on death without checking [[BUC]] first. [[DeathOnAStick|Lives have been ruined that way.]]
* [[Plains centaur]]s in the mirror are stronger than they appear.
* [[Baby silver dragon]]s don't reflect zaps of cold that you shoot at them. Looks like it's going to storm!
* Hitting e instead of w can be a fatal mistake when you have a [[cockatrice]] corpse.
* Don't stand on [[ice]] when there are foes with fire attack around.
* What do you think [[amulet of life saving]] is for?
* When [[polypiling]], be careful with where you aim. In particular, don't hit that damn chest with goodies - if it polymorphs into non-container, ALL CONTENTS ARE LOST.
** Contents are always lost on polymorph, but the container has a 5% chance of resisting the polymorph beam. (95% for the Wallet of Perseus in SLASH'EM.)
* Wield the [[cockatrice|cockatrice corpse]] when you're already in position to attack (you won't be moving into any unknown squares). Otherwise you will fall into a [[spiked pit]] on your way to your victim.
**Commentary: and be instantaneously [[stoning|stoned]]. Any [[pit]], [[trap door]], or [[hole]] will have the same effect. If there is an item, you can check for known traps with the {{kbd|^}} command.
* Don't anger your [[god]] after getting [[Intrinsic protection|divine protection]]. Praying for [[unholy water]] on a crossaligned [[altar]], for example.
**Commentary: Unless you can afford to buy it back. ([[potion of unholy water|Unholy water]] can also be manufactured via [[confused]] [[BUC|blessed]] [[scroll of remove curse|remove curse]] or [[dip|dipping]] [[potions of water]] into [[fountain]]s.)
* Don't melee [[cockatrice]]s if you're [[polymorph]]ed, ''especially'' if you are a [[vrock]], [[master mind flayer]], [[vampire lord]], [[dragon]] or any other biting monster.
** If you are a yellow dragon it is safe. (You need to ''be'' a yellow dragon&mdash;yellow [[dragon scale mail]] isn't enough.)
* Drop your [[gold]], [[bag of holding]], and [[unicorn horn]] on another square before [[sit|#sitting]] on a [[throne]].
**Commentary: It is only necessary to drop your [[bag of holding]] or [[unicorn horn]] if your [[Luck]] is zero or less, in which case they could be [[BUC|cursed]]. See [[throne]] for more details on exact [[throne]] effects and precautions to take. It is also safer to put them into a container than to drop them, so that monsters can't get at them.
* If you have recently dispatched a [[cockatrice]] while being blind and not wearing [[glove]]s, always move with the '[[m]]' key. Doing so will cause you not to automatically feel objects on the ground.
* If someone throws an egg at you, it might have been a [[cockatrice egg]] - don't skip through the messages about stiffening and turning to stone as if they were ordinary battle spam, if you don't want to become a [[statue]].
** Commentary: Cockatrice eggs are the only eggs monsters ever use.
* If you don't have a way to protect against [[touch of death]], NEVER step off of an [[E-square]] when facing an [[arch-lich]].
** Commentary: Or a [[scroll of scare monster]] as of 3.6.0.
* While trying to tame something using {{spell of|charm monster}} that can resist, you'll probably gain a lot of pets. Naming them *all* will help keep you from sacrificing a pet (since corpses retain names) and losing your 50 points of [[protection]].
* Always kill shapechangers when you see them.  If you don't they turn into bad things that will kill you. (argiopeweb -- Minotaur in Soko3)
**Commentary: (Demin -- Black Dragon Gnomish Mines lv 2) (RegalStar -- Archlich in Soko4) (Beezor -- Master Lich on the Rogue Quest. Of course, I didn't realize there were like 8 guaranteed chameleons on that level at the time, so avoiding that level entirely was probably the best idea. It tele'd in w/ ToD before I could even see it)
* If you see any messages pertaining to a [[swamp]], do NOT blithely skip along the level. You WILL hit the water, and all your stuff WILL get blanked.
* If you're dipping potions into a fountain, don't typo and dip your bag of holding. The RNG will curse it. Every time.
**Commentary: You can dig down on a [[fountain]] to make a [[moat|pool of water]], which is much safer to work with.
**Commentary: When digging down on a fountain, don't stash your armor, weapons, and BoH within four squares of the fountain. The resulting flood can extend out to five. If 3.4.3 and earlier, write several [[Elbereth]] in the dust below the items; as of 3.6.0, use scrolls of scare monster instead. If you have a rustproof weapon like Grayswandir, it's probably best to take it with you into the moat.
* Wielding a [[cockatrice corpse]] around a [[foocubus]] is an excellent way to get a [[Stoning|permanent hard-on]].
**Commentary: A [[charisma]] of 20 will reliably allow you to tell the foocubus not to take your [[gloves]] off. Don't type too fast though.
* Don't try to feed a [[dragon]] unless it is currently [[tame]]. If it is [[peaceful]], [[thrown]] [[food]] will anger it.
**Commentary: Food can only be used to tame [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[horse]]s, including their little and large stages; bananas will also tame some [[apelike creature]]s.
* Standing on a burnt Elbereth and reverse genociding dragons to create DSM is a great idea... unless you have uncontrolled teleportitis.
**Commentary: In that case, go to [[Sokoban]] and use an [[Elbereth]] cage.
* If you are riding a dragon over water avoid any foocubus. There is a chance a given attack hits your steed and it will remove the saddle.
* Destroying a drawbridge with force bolt kills everything in the same way as closing it. Including you.
* Even if you've been struggling with containerless inventory management for 10,000 turns, and you've finally got a [[bag of holding]] from a wish, don't get all excited and just throw everything into it. That pesky [[wand of cancellation]] will go in last, and then you're screwed.
* If your luck is negative, or even if you think it MIGHT be negative, DON'T WISH UNTIL YOU FIX IT!
* Never eat an unknown tin whilst hallucinating. It WILL be cockatrice meat.
**Commentary: Cockatrice and chickatrice meat always "smells like chicken" when hallucinating. (Chickens don't exist in vanilla NetHack.) Tins of [[disenchanter]] meat or anything of [[cannibalism|your race]] give no warning, however.
* Be careful if you have suffered amnesia. Although not remembering the exact layout of a level while climbing the dungeon with the Amulet is annoying, what's more annoying is forgetting that ELAM EBOW is a scroll of enchant weapon, deciding not to identify it first, and then reading it while wielding your blessed +7 Grayswandir.
** If you get mind-flayed very often, it helps to collect a specimen of everything in your [[stash]], to mass-identify.
* Stand back when casting fireball unless you want your pets and belongings to burn.
* When it comes to genociding (Master) Mind flayers, if you're a dwarf ... enough said ...
* When surrounded by resurrecting rock troll corpses, don't quaff an unidentified potion. It will be polymorph, and you will become a grid bug.
* In SLASH'EM, make sure you beware creatures hiding under items. It could be a deadly [[asphynx]], which has the ability to petrify you and cause an easy-to-miss YASD.
* Unless you are in immediate danger of dying, don't break an unidentified wand. You may be killed by a blast of magic.
**Commentary: Most of them blast you for some amount of damage dependent on their charges. Many of them have secondary effects like teleportation or slowing.
* If the RNG gives you another bag of holding after you already have one, leave it alone. Don't carry it around as a spare. You ''will ''space out and try to put one of them in the other.
**Commentary: Hauling it to your stash is good, but do so carefully, and possibly on a separate trip. Alternatively, putting both bags into another container will eliminate the possibility of typos.
* When trying to get [[crowning|crowned]] so that your god will give you a [[spellbook of finger of death]], make sure your luck is actually maxed before casting create monster a couple hundred times.
* Carrying around a lot of potions in your main inventory is a bad idea. You will step on a magic trap and die when a blast of fire causes all of your potions to boil and explode right after you've wished for blessed +3 [[silver dragon scale mail]] and [[the Master Key of Thievery]].
** Commentary: You ideally want to stash them at some point anyway, unless you have a bag to keep them all in - the weight of potions can add up pretty quickly.
* Don't try that genocide scroll until you've BUC tested it! A room full of Liches at level 3 leads to YASD!
* A throne room full of dragons is fantastic for intrinsics but take your damn time in eating them. They're a lot to choke down and it sucks to find out that you have just choked on your disintegration resistance.
** Commentary: Killing and eating them one at a time is good. A [[tinning kit]] will also help. They are larger than most other corpses.
* Using a cursed [[scroll of create monster]] to create sacrifice fodder is never a good idea.
**Commentary: Though a confused one is handy at times (it will produce only acid blobs, good for blocking movement.)
**Commentary: '''Never''' try to create monsters as a weak character without a good escape route. Almost every monster creation method has a chance of summoning a horde rather than a single monster. 
* Don't throw Mjollnir while blind -- you won't catch it, and will likely be hit and lose all your wands and rings.
* Consider that Mjollnir returns only 99% of the time before throwing it at a Titan.
* Sex in real life can cause life-threatening conditions. This applies to NetHack too, for [[Foocubus|different reasons]].
* Wishes are valuable. To avoid wasting one on a redundant item, know your inventory ''before'' employing a potential source of wishing.
** Commentary: Wishes are divine in nature, so praying right after receiving one is a bad idea.
* Found the [[Big Room]]? Stay on the up stair and watch out for [[quantum mechanic]]s!
* Dragon scales don't make good polyfodder.
* If you're wearing the Tie-Dye Shirt of Shambhala (in dNetHack) that your god gave you, wear your [[ring of polymorph control]] too (a mask isn't enough), or stepping on a polytrap will deprive you of its increased carrying capacity for the rest of your run!
* [[Teleport control]] doesn't work when you're unconscious from rotten food, so even it's not a complete safeguard against [[teleportitis]].
* A greased helmet is not a license to melee [[mind flayer]]s.
* Always use up [[cockatrice egg]]s you lay. Tame cockatrices turn any [[golem]] to [[stone golem]], which is hard to kill.
**Commentary: Or store the [[egg]] in a [[container]] until it is no longer hatchable after 200 [[turns]]. It will still [[petrify]] when you want to use it.
* Cursed [[athame]]s aren't good items to [[engrave]] with.
* After you're done dancing with nurses or foocubuses, DON'T FORGET TO RE-EQUIP YOURSELF!
* On that note, be sure to remove all armor AND weapons before reverse-genociding that swarm of nurses.
* A [[xorn]] will gladly munch your [[Magicbane]], especially when you disrobe to take a bath and blank scrolls.
** Sacrifice gifts are always rustproof, and if you wish for it you should order it rustproof, so there is usually no reason to unwield artifacts for that anyway.
* When you're on a level with water or lava, and you have uncontrolled teleportitis, and your connection is laggy, TREAD LIGHTLY.
* If you've altar scummed for [[Magicbane]] as a wizard who started with a [[ring of slow digestion]], don't forget that you can actually use it to engrave an E-square when you're facing a giant ant.
**Commentary: Engrave with Magicbane, not the ring of course ;).
* Be careful about wishing for cross-aligned/cross-class artifacts when low-level or low on health, especially when said artifacts are intelligent.
* Don't polymorph an air elemental in Slash'em. You will get a very fast baby dragon that is even more powerful.
** Commentary: Also applies to vanilla, and the resulting monster will be that fast only for 1 turn.
* Do not try to [[Dragon scale mail#Making dragon scale mail from scales|make]] a set of dragon scales into a dragon scale mail if the dragon scales are already enchanted to +4 or higher. As of NetHack 3.6.2, the evaporation check takes place before the merging, so you risk losing it. Even an uncursed [[Scroll of enchant armor|scroll]], which would not normally add an enchantment point, will try to evaporate an overenchanted set of scales.
** Commentary: this situation might happen as a result of stepping onto a [[polymorph trap]] without magic resistance while wearing an overenchanted dragon scale mail. You turn into a dragon and the mail is reverted to a set of scales, yet the enchantment is preserved. After returning to your normal form, lower the enchantment to +3 before trying to convert them to a dragon scale mail again.
* Just because you're at -20 AC and dodged a shot from a [[wand of death]] doesn't mean you'll be able to do it a second time. When in doubt, just play it safe and teleport out of there.
* Don't ever try clearing a [[throne room]] with a newly-gifted [[Mjollnir]] when you have no means of escape or other ways to fight them, or else you'll find yourself with a room full of awake monsters throwing everything they have at you.

===[[Gnomish Mines]]===
* Be wary of statues in the [[Gnomish Mines]]...
* And also remember to press ''k ''if you want to kick things off a rolling boulder trap in the Gnomish Mines
* Skip the Gnomish Mines and come back when you're more powerful, or, you won't get past level 3 of the main branch and will die in the Gnomish Mines.
**Commentary: If you're playing as a [[Gnome]] or [[Dwarf]], most of the monsters will be peaceful.
* If you find [[Minetown]] [[bones]], before you go #chatting up the [[priest]], make SURE both the priest and the [[altar]] are of the same [[alignment]].
**Commentary: Also make sure that the [[temple]] isn't haunted. There is no way to fix that.
* If a fountain in [[Minetown]] reduces to a trickle, cease using it immediately.
* If you want to create [[Excalibur]] in Minetown, make absolutely sure that there are no watchmen around (or that you have a pet strong enough to deal with them). Even if they aren't in sight, they will somehow sense you and get angry at you, and killing them count as murder.
* Do not walk around Minetown blind for easy guard murder as a chaotic until you can smite a [[leocrotta]] in one hit. The Watch Captain hits hard at lower levels. If not chaotic, wait it out.
**Commentary: #[[Chat]] will get responses from watchmen: if you get none, it is safe to move there.
* A trio of [[large cat]]s will not protect you from a [[floating eye]] in [[Minetown]].

===[[Sokoban]]===
* Do NOT do Sokoban if your NetHack lags.
* Just because you beat [[Sokoban]] and got a [[bag of holding]] doesn't mean you're invincible.
* When in [[Sokoban]], and you are at the fringe of death, do not try to teleport away using a scroll of teleportation. Sokoban is a [[non-teleport level|no-teleport area]], which will result in a few more hits from that monster you are trying to flee from, possibly resulting in your death.
* When you solve a [[Sokoban]] level and open the door at the end of the hall, it will be packed with monsters. One might just be a [[Nymph]] who will charm you, steal your [[wand of death]], fail to teleport then use it on you.
** Instead, displace a pet inside, or fight diagonally at the door because monsters are less likely to zap you at melee range.
** For that matter, always use [[telepathy]] to scout out the [[treasure zoo]] before rushing inside.
* Keep in mind that an [[amulet of reflection|AoR]] from [[Sokoban]] can be cursed, although you should put it on anyway. BUC status has no effect on the amulet's power; you just can't take it off as with any cursed amulet.
** Commentary: If the amulet is missing for some reason, kill and search every monster on the level. Monsters will never pick up the [[bag of holding]].
* Training escape spells by repeatedly casting "{{spell of|jumping}}" is a sound strategy -- except in Sokoban. Especially if you plan to zap your wand of wishing soon afterward.
**Commentary: Jumping in Sokoban carries a &minus;1 Luck penalty. You don't get dinged if you press escape at the prompt where you want to jump.  You can also jump without penalty on a level you have already solved.
* If you just broke boulders or did anything that could reduce your luck, be extra careful. You don't want your prayer to fail.

===[[Medusa's Island]]===
* {{spell of|Levitation}} spells don't cut it on [[Medusa's Island]]. Find a permanent source.
** Commentary: With [[escape spells]] at a [[skill]] level of Skilled or Expert, the spell is equivalent to a blessed [[potion of levitation]], giving 250&ndash;299 turns of [[levitation]], which should be sufficient. At Unskilled or Basic, this spell may give you as few as ''ten'' turns.
** Commentary: In Nethack 3.6.1, you will get a warning when your levitation is about to run out, giving you time to cast the spell again or get above ground if you watch your warnings.
* Don't go below dungeon level 18 or so without a means of crossing water. Falling past [[Medusa]] through a hole can really ruin your whole day.
** Commentary: You can continue pressing onward and find a means to cross, e.g. a wand of cold or some scrolls of earth - at minimum you're very likely to get something from the Castle, aside from the guaranteed wand of wishing.
* Don't eat anything while standing on [[Medusa]]'s corpse. You WILL fatfinger it and suffer a legendarily stupid [[stoning]].
** Commentary: Watch out for [[footrice]]s as well. [[Green slime]]s are dangerous as well, to a lesser extent.
* AVOID [[foocubus|foocubi]] of opposite gender when levitating over water in Medusa's level using boots. Drowning is not kinky.
** Commentary: A [[charisma]] of 20 will force the foocubi to ask, but watch out for typos.
* Blind yourself BEFORE walking up the stairs to Medusa's house if you've dug to avoid moving over her water. Else she will petrify you right away.
**Commentary: Medusa is @. Elbereth won't stop her, even if you have time to burn it.
* If you have [[jumping boots]] or can cast the spell, it's possible to cross the water on Medusa's level by jumping from island to island. Just make sure that the statue you're about to jump towards really is a statue, and not a mimic who will block your jump with fatal results.
* Don't bring a pet [[gremlin]] to [[Medusa]]'s level.

===[[Quest]]===
* Don't EVER tangle with [[Cyclops]], the [[Healer]] quest nemesis, in melee.
**Commentary: [[Magic cancellation]] has no effect on [[the Staff of Aesculapius]]'s level draining attack.
* Don't rely on a [[quest artifact]] as the only source of ANYTHING.
**Commentary: That is, in the late game, where the [[Wizard of Yendor]] can appear and steal it. Before that, it is fine.
* Any monster in the '[[follower]]' category will follow you through portals created by [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]].
**Commentary: They will also follow you through [[staircases]] or any other level change.
* Monsters will follow you through your quest portal. Engraving on the portal square doesn't work.
* If you [[Eye of the Aethiopica|Branchport]] into [[Fort Ludios]], you may very well land in the area just outside the inner keep and get swarmed by everything. While it's (generally) not a fatal error, it can still get rather annoying when you can't deal with about fifty creatures one-on-one.
* [[Ashikaga Takauji]] gets two attacks per round.  While extremely unlikely, it's possible to get [[Tsurugi of Muramasa|bisected]] twice in a row, so even an [[Amulet of life saving]] isn't a surefire way to survive!
* Don't kick trees in the [[ranger quest]] maze, unless you want the resident [[minotaur]] to ruin your day.
* Never, ever, ever [[jump]] near your [[quest leader]]. Your [[quest portal]] will be removed, with only one way to salvage your game: [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]].  Better hope you're a [[neutral]] non-[[wizard]].  It also helps to be able to cast {{Spell of|charm monster}} with a relatively low failure rate.
* If you genocide [[giant]]s before you do the [[Valkyrie]] [[quest]], you will get lots of [[titan]]s instead. You don't want lots of titans.
* If you have controlled teleportitis, don't use an uncursed scroll of earth to build your boulder fort - especially in Kaen's lair.
* In SLASH'EM, yes, you '''can''' sacrifice [[the Hand of Vecna]]. And yes, this gets rid of it permanently.
* On the Valkyrie goal level, there's a good chance that a boulder dropped or thrown by a giant will block a drawbridge. If you must use a wand of striking to dispose of it, do so from a safe distance.
* Reflection is very important on the Ranger Quest. Lots of centaurs means lots of attack wands.

===[[Castle]]===
* The castle level is a cruel, cruel place... Trust me...
* Don't crush [[peaceful]]s in the Castle [[drawbridge]], even if you don't want a [[red naga]] to fry you under conflict. The resulting bad luck can make your wished-for blessed magic marker come out cursed. The resulting cursed scrolls of charging will ''discharge'' and waste your wand of wishing.
* Even though you're fire resistant and put on that ring of levitation to get out of the [[lava]], you'll still die instantly when your legs get stuck.
* Forcing the lock on the chest with a blunt weapon on the castle level isn't the best idea. Kicking it isn't such a good idea either, if the object you're expecting happens to be made of glass or crystal.
* If you drop your weapons and armor to go for a scroll-blanking swim in the [[castle]]'s moat, please take care where you leave those items lying around. Chasing down a [[master mind flayer]] that's made off with your +7 [[Grayswandir]] is not fun when you're unarmed.
* When you get to the [[castle]] level, do not burn [[Elbereth]] on the drawbridge and fight the monsters there. A wand of striking will kill you instantly, and it won't be fun.
* Plugging the [[trap door]]s on the Castle level with boulders is a [[Bad Idea]].  It will result in the lower levels being inaccessible, except through a [[teleport-control|controlled]] level teleport.
**Commentary: You cannot dig downwards on the [[castle]] level. Leaving even one trap door open is sufficient. Since [[NetHack 3.6.0]] you can dig through the filled trap doors.
*When you're cutting a swathe on your way to the castle and you spot a master mind flayer nearby, and you're confident because you greased a helmet specifically for this occasion, if you're going to engage him in melee, '''''make sure you put the blasted thing on.'''''

===[[Gehennom]]===
* When breaking wands for their area-denial purpose, DO NOT break a [[wand of lightning]] unless you hate your rings.
* Especially not when Demogorgon is on the level. Not even if double-meleeing arch liches.
** Commentary: the Wizard of Yendor and his clone are better examples, since arch-liches are resistant anyway.
*** Sorry, it was me who did that, and it just makes the original death even stupider in retrospect…  {{unsigned|Ais523|12:43, 20 October 2012 (UTC)}}
* In [[Moloch's Sanctum]], be sure that you have entered the temple, and that the [[high priest]] has called you an infidel, before killing him. If you don't, you'll get dinged for [[murder]].
* Watch where you kill the Wizard the first time. Killing him above the moat is a VERY VERY bad idea if you can't swim.
**Commentary: A way to fill the moat like a [[scroll of earth]], [[wand of cold]], [[frost horn]], the spell of {{spell of|cone of cold}}, or access to white or silver [[dragon]] breath attacks will resolve the problem. The [[invocation artifacts]] and the [[Amulet of Yendor]] will always rise to the surface.
* After spending hours of hard work and effort to descend into Gehennom, only to be swamped by monsters, remember to check your status as often as your inventory. Scrolls of genocide may be great escape items, but only if that umber hulk next to you isn't looking your way!
**Commentary: And no, your AoLS will not save your sorry self here! In general, the [[amulet of life saving]] will fail to save you if you genocide yourself or have your intelligence reduced below 3 by a [[mind flayer]].
* When you've been fighting hordes of monsters as a master mind flayer, remember that your stomach is now quite full. Do not try eating anything, especially a randomly generated newt in the lower levels of Gehennom just to try and get that one extra point of power for the heck of it.
* If you enter an area (say, perhaps the zoo on the way to kill the Wizard) with cockatrices and weapon-wielding monsters (say, perhaps a troll), back off and make SURE you've got a lizard corpse handy in your inventory. Be a good Boy Scout and always be prepared.
* Do not [[teleport at will]] while hungry if there is a demon prince attacking you. You will likely faint from the energy cost of this and be entirely at their mercy.
** Commentary: As of NetHack 3.7, it doesn't work in their presence anyway.
* Don't attack [[Orcus]] with [[Mjollnir]], unless you want that shiny [[Wand of death|Wand of Death]] to be destroyed by lightning.
* Just walk right up to the [[Executioner]] in [[Sheol]] ([[UnNethack]]). Come on Punk, make my day.
* [[Levitation]] does not protect you from the [[kraken]] in [[Wizard of Yendor|Rodney]]'s (the wizard, not the bot) [[moat]].
** Commentary: And neither does [[flight]].
* Don't engrave [[Elbereth]] on the [[vibrating square]]. Else [[Orcus]] won't follow you into the [[Sanctum]] to retrieve the Amulet. (He will no longer retrieve it for you anyway as of 3.6.1.)

===[[Ascension run]]===
* Using [[water walking boots]] on the [[plane of water]] will result in you drowning. [[Levitation]], on the other hand, will work safely.
**Commentary: As of version 3.6, you can't levitate there either.
* Don't try to disarm/disarmor your [[Archon]] with F command when [[polymorph]]ed into a [[nymph]]. You can untame it.
** Commentary: Instead, [[scroll of enchant armor|enchant]] its new [[armor]] better than what it's currently wearing, and drop the armor in front of your [[pet]]. It will change once it eventually picks it up. [[Weapon]]s are a bit trickier&mdash;a [[bullwhip]] is a safe way to disarm your pet. To keep it from swapping artifacts, you want it to drop as many items as possible before you give it its new weapon.
* Zapping a high priest/priestess on the Astral Plane with a wand of teleportation to move them off an altar DOES NOT WORK. It makes them angry instead, even if they were peaceful beforehand.
* Don't polymorph in > direction while riding. Even your ki-rin is not invincible; A's are vulnerable to system shocks!
* Don't mess with player type characters on the Astral Plane. Yes, there's only a small chance they'll be spawned with the Vorpal Blade. Yes, there's only a slight chance that the Vorpal Blade will instantly behead you. The RNG will kill you. Every time.
* [[Archon]]s' dazzle is incredibly annoying — {{of|pair|lenses}} are nearly worthless.
**Commentary: Lenses do not stop an Archon's gaze attack, only [[blinding venom]] and [[raven]] claws.
* Despite an Archon being a very powerful and useful pet capable of dispatching many enemies on its own, it is not immune to being engulfed and digested.
* Don't let your flying steed die when you're over water or lava. [[Fire elemental]]s on the [[Plane of Fire]] can do a lot of damage to a steed without [[fire resistance]].
* A steam vortex will happily carry you out of an air bubble on the Plane of Water, even if you aren't levitating.  You'll drown as soon as you're expelled.
* [[Far look]] won't tell you if a high altar is co-aligned - [[Altar#High altars|"aligned" and "co-aligned" are not the same.]]
* If you lack [[reflection]], don't forget about [[Medusa]].

C341-5 - request for clarification

On known bug list it appears as "When you see your pet move, the pet may be
referred to as "it"." What are the circumstances in which this occurs?

I am working on fixing vanilia bugs in my fork but this one is so unclear that
nobody knows how to reproduce it.

In general - is it possible to publish at least bug reports send to devteam?

:We are very low tech on the backend, so currently, no, we don't have the capability to publish bug reports.

:I think I have found one that I believe relates to this issue, but it may not be the only case:
:# Start a game in wizard mode
:# Wish for a wand of make invisible
:# Wish for a tripe ration
:# Wish for an amulet of ESP
:# Drop the tripe ration
:# Put on the amulet of ESP
:# Zap your starting pet with the wand of make invisible
:# Step way and let your pet eat
:# Watch the message "It eats a tripe ration."

:Although, it could also be this report, which mentions movement:
:My character has invisible pet (it was a cat, but after polymorph it "disappeared" and now it walks around, answers magic whistle, fights...). My character cannot see it. Only - NetHack gave me message "It moves only reluctantly". And I/my character should not be able to see it (I do not even know on which item it was at the time).

:Like I wrote, our backend is low tech.
