&&%s&& %s Theft (attack) {148726 2022-10-08T09:21:16Z {375 Ion frigate} Muggers in SLASHEM don't steal :''See also [[Stealing from shops]]''

Some monsters have a '''theft''' attack. These include [[nymph]]s and [[monkey]]s, who steal items, and [[leprechaun]]s, who [[Steal gold|steal]] [[Zorkmid|gold]]. In addition, quest nemeses and the [[Wizard of Yendor]] will [[Covetous|try to steal]] the [[Amulet of Yendor]], the [[Invocation items]], or your [[quest artifact]].

You can steal items by attacking a monster of the opposite gender as a [[foocubus]]. In addition, striking weaponless as a [[nymph]] will attempt to steal from your target, but will not make it [[hostile]]. (Both types of monsters will similarily try to steal items if they melee other monsters.)

[[Magic cancellation]] does not protect against stealing attacks.

==Strategy==
Earlier in the game, when you encounter nymphs and leprechauns, it is often a good strategy to stay away from them, as they are generated asleep. You can easily kill them with ranged attacks or let a pet do the work. Give them individual names so you know which monster to chase in case they manage to steal something.

The high-level [[covetous]] monsters are quite a different lot. Most [[Lich#Strategy|strategies how to deal with liches]] generalize quite well. The Wizard should get [[Wizard_of_Yendor#Strategy|priority treatment]].

==SLASH'EM==
SLASH'EM adds a few more stealing monsters, e.g., [[gnome thief|gnome thieves]] and [[pixie]]s. Additionally, there is the #[[borrow]] extended command, which lets the player attempt to steal items from monsters, even when in their normal form.

&&%s&& %s Izchak {149909 2023-02-10T16:38:54Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Encyclopaedia entry */ Soften line breaks {{otheruses|the in-game shopkeeper|the DevTeam member|Izchak Miller}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''Izchak''' is a special [[shopkeeper]] who runs the lighting [[shop]] in [[Minetown]]. He has a fixed [[gender]] (like tool shop owners, but unlike other shopkeepers) and a slightly different conversational repertoire from other shopkeepers, but is otherwise identical for game purposes.

==History==
[[Izchak Miller]] was one of the founding members of the ''NetHack'' [[DevTeam]]. Professor Miller passed away on the 1st of April, 1994, at the age of 58, from complications due to cancer. The DevTeam added Izchak the shopkeeper into the game in [[NetHack 3.2.0]] as a tribute, inspired partly by his work on the shopkeeper code. The character on the [http://www.nethack.org/common/scrn3b.gif navigation imagemap] on the ''NetHack'' site is also named after him.

==Etiquette==
Although there are no special in-game penalties for doing so, many players consider it extremely poor form to kill this particular shopkeeper. The ''NetHack'' community itself is somewhat divided on this issue&mdash;in [[Libera|#nethack]], it's rare to see someone reprimand another player for killing him (although most people still try to avoid it); in [[RGRN]], at least several vocal regulars will usually reprimand any transgressions; and the wiki itself sees a broad mix of editors' opinions.

For [[extinctionist]] games, it is considered acceptable to leave Izchak alive -- there is no "official" definition of extinctionism, and most automated definitions, e.g. the ones used at the [[:/dev/null/nethack tournament]], care only about the monster kill and born counters and extinction flag and thus do not require Izchak's death in particular anyway. Getting these up to their maximum values for [[shopkeeper]]s can be done via repeatedly killing, resurrecting, and rekilling any shopkeeper; an extinctionist game would likely want to do this anyway to gain 120 or 255 shopkeeper kills.

==Variants==
===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], Izchak is guaranteed to remain alive if [[Orcish Town]] is generated.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Izchak is the only shopkeeper to have a special response if killed.

===The November NetHack Tournament===
In [[The November NetHack Tournament]] from 2022 onward, the reward for completing the [[The DevTeam Office|dev team's quest]], the [[Really Cool Shirt]], is not given if you personally killed Izchak previously.

==Encyclopaedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The shopkeeper of the lighting shop in the town level of the gnomish mines is a tribute to Izchak Miller, a founding member of the NetHack development team and a personal friend of a large number of us.  Izchak contributed greatly to the game, coding a large amount of the shopkeep logic (hence the nature of the tribute) as well as a good part of the alignment system, the prayer code and the rewrite of "hell" in the 3.1 release.  Izchak was a professor of Philosophy, who taught at many respected institutions, including MIT and Stanford, and who also worked, for a period of time, at Xerox PARC.  Izchak was the first "librarian" of the NetHack project, and was a founding member of the DevTeam, joining in 1986 while he was working at the University of Pennsylvania (hence our former mailing list address).  Until the 3.1.3 release, Izchak carefully kept all of the code synchronized and arbitrated disputes between members of the development teams.  Izchak Miller passed away at the age of 58, in the early morning hours of April 1, 1994 from complications due to cancer.  We then dedicated NetHack 3.2 in his memory.

'''Izchak Miller''' was a Professor of Philosophy who taught at MIT and Stanford, amongst other places, and was employed at Xerox PARC for a while. Izchak joined the [[DevTeam]] in 1986, at which time he was working at the University of Pennsylvania. He was, in fact, one of the founding members of the DevTeam, and was instrumental in synchronizing and arbitrating the team for a long time, up until the release of [[NetHack 3.1.3|version 3.1.3]]. He personally wrote much of the [[shopkeeper]] code, as well as major contributions to [[prayer]], [[alignment|alignments]], and the [[NetHack 3.1.0|version 3.1]] rewrite of [[Gehennom]].

Izchak died on the 1st of April 1994 from complications due to cancer, at the age of 58. The DevTeam dedicated [[NetHack 3.2.0|NetHack 3.2]] in his memory and added a shopkeeper named [[Izchak]], in addition to the already-existing random possibility for tool shopkeepers of the name [[Source:Shknam.c#line112|Kachzi Rellim]] (an anagram of his name). It is considered very poor form to mistreat this particular shopkeeper, despite the extent to which his co-workers are maligned by everyone. Often, he is even spared by [[extinctionist]]s.

&&%s&& %s Nutrition {142557 2021-09-10T02:12:47Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Losing nutrition */ Link for stressed In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''nutrition''' is essential for keeping [[Hero|your character]] alive. Too little and you starve; too much and you choke.

==Sources of nutrition==
[[Comestibles]] are the main source of nutrition. {{kbd|e}}ating increases your nutrition (equivalently, decreases your hunger) by a set amount. For example, a non-rotten [[food ration]] grants 800 units of nutrition ([[rotten food]] only gives 50% of its usual nutrition). If polymorphed into a [[metallivore]], metal objects can also be eaten for nutrition.

[[Wraith]] corpses can be eaten, but provide zero nutrition. It is nevertheless possible to choke on them (see below).

A player starts with 900 nutrition points.

==Hunger status==
On the [[status line]], your hunger is displayed if you are anything other than "Not hungry". The following table lists the hunger states and the corresponding amount of nutrition remaining.

{|class="wikitable"
!Nutrition!!Hunger
|-
|2000 or more||Oversatiated<ref group="note">"Oversatiated" is commonly used to refer to the state in which choking is guaranteed, but it is not actually a hunger status. This means it will still be displayed as "Satiated".</ref>
|-
|1000 to 1999||Satiated
|-
|150 to 999||Not hungry<ref group="note">This is not displayed.</ref>
|-
|50 to 149||Hungry
|-
|0 to 49||Weak
|-
|Below zero||Fainting
|-
|Below minimum||Starved<ref group="note">This state is displayed when a character has died of starvation.</ref>
|}
<references group="note"/>

The minimum in the table above is &minus;100 &minus; (10×[[Constitution|Con]]).{{refsrc|eat.c|2329}} For a Con:18 character, that's &minus;280.

You can choke if you eat while satiated, and you will not reliably get a warning. If your nutrition is 1500 or more,{{refsrc|eat.c|2201}} you may get a warning that you're having a hard time getting the food down. If you continue to eat, you risk choking to death. Sometimes ''NetHack'' will give you an option to "Stop eating? (yn) <y>". If you continue to eat, you risk choking. If you select {{kbd|y}} and eat something else, you will usually immediately choke.

If you consume any food while oversatiated, even a zero-nutrition [[wraith]] corpse, you choke, [[instadeath|killing you instantly]]. 

In precise terms, you choke if and only if you would be oversatiated after the meal{{refsrc|eat.c|2101}}{{refsrc|eat.c|2188}} and you were already satiated before the meal,{{refsrc|eat.c|992}}{{refsrc|eat.c|2089}} or if you eat an [[amulet of strangulation]]. Here, "before the meal" refers to before this individual food item, i.e., interruptions do not make a meal unsafe as long as you do not eat something else in between and you do not save and restore the game.

You cannot choke to death if you possess [[magical breathing]]&mdash;instead you will "stuff yourself, then vomit voluminously", losing 1000 points of nutrition. This also has a 1/20 chance of occurring anyway when you would otherwise choke but do not possess magical breathing.{{refsrc|eat.c|240}} Magical breathing can be gained extrinsically from the [[amulet of magical breathing|amulet]], intrinsically through [[eating jewelry|eating]] the amulet or else [[polymorph]]ing yourself into a creature with unbreathing.

While weak, your strength is decreased and abused. While fainted, you are vulnerable to attack as if [[paralyzed]]. Being satiated [[abuse]]s [[dexterity]], as well as [[wisdom]] for [[Monks]].{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|472|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Monks also exercise wisdom while weak from hunger, but still abuse strength as with other roles.{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|464|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Being "not hungry" (which technically includes the state of being "hungry", but not "weak") exercises constitution.{{refsrc|src/attrib.c|467|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Occasionally, while hungry you will receive the message "(player class) needs food badly!" (This message always occurs when you become weak if playing as a [[Valkyrie]], [[Wizard]], or an [[elf]] of any class.) This is a reference to the series of [[wikipedia:Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]] dungeon crawler arcade games, where food is usually a far more pressing issue since it is a healing item; the games' narrator will boom the same message when your player is dying.

==Losing nutrition==
Every turn you lose one point of nutrition, unless you are wearing a [[ring of slow digestion]] or are polymorphed into an [[inediate]] monster.{{reffunc|eat.c|gethungry}} If you are asleep or fainted, there is only a 10% chance this point of nutrition will be lost.{{refsrc|eat.c|2130}}

In addition, the following conditions also result in losing points of nutrition:
* Every twenty [[turn]]s, you lose one point of nutrition:
** For each [[ring]] you wear, unless it is a chargeable ring and is at +0; the turn that this is calculated is different for your left and right hands.
** If you're wearing an [[amulet]].
** If you're carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]].
* Every even turn you lose one point of nutrition if:
** You are generating [[conflict]] and this is not caused by an artifact
** You have intrinsic or extrinsic [[Hunger (property)|hunger]]
* Every odd turn you lose one point of nutrition if:
** You have [[regeneration]] and this is not caused by an artifact
** You are [[encumbrance|stressed]] or worse{{refsrc|eat.c|2140}}

All of these sources stack, so it is possible to burn nutrition at up to 320% of the normal rate. Note that 'turn' refers to game turn, ''not'' movement turn. The nutrition is lost as the turn counter advances, not as you move.

Attacking a monster uses the same amount of nutrition you'd consume on a whole turn, in addition to the normal hungering.{{refsrc|hack.c|1078}} For this purpose, attempting to move into the same square as a monster counts as an attack, even if, e.g., the monster is a pet which you displace. Since NetHack 3.6.0, declining to attack a peaceful monster when prompted does not consume nutrition. The {{kbd|m}} command never incurs this extra hunger.

[[Jumping]] incurs a 1d25 hunger penalty, regardless of its source.{{refsrc|apply.c|1363}}

[[Spell]]casting without [[hungerless casting]] or [[reduced-hunger casting]] (both of which are granted only to high-[[intelligence]] [[wizard]]s) incurs a hunger penalty, unless the spell is [[Spellbook of detect food|detect food]], which costs 0.{{refsrc|spell.c|761}} The base penalty is ten times the level of the spell you're casting.{{refsrc|spell.c|762}} Spellcasting with the [[Amulet of Yendor]] incurs an additional d(spell level * 4) hunger penalty (which is also affected by wizard hunger reduction).{{refsrc|spell.c|753}}

[[Teleporting at will]] uses 100 nutrition; teleporting using a [[trap]] or the {{spell of|teleport away}} spell does not use any additional nutrition outside of the cost of the spell in the latter case.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|A +0 [[ring of protection]] now causes ring hunger if it is your only source of extrinsic protection. If you are wearing two rings of protection and the one on your left hand is +0, ring hunger applies to it, even if the right ring is charged. A [[meat ring]] or [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]] no longer incurs extra hunger.}}

==Nutrition and pets==

All pets, except for [[inediate]] pets, require nutrition to stay alive, though 2&ndash;8 times less than the player,{{reffunc|dogmove.c|dog_nutrition}} depending on its size. [[Carnivorous]] and [[omnivorous]] pets will generally kill enough monsters on their own to be able to live off the [[corpses]] of the monsters they kill. [[Herbivorous]] pets have a harder time, since the majority of monsters do not leave vegetarian corpses. However, fruit and vegetable items such as [[apple]]s, [[carrot]]s, [[melon]]s, and so on provide a herbivorous pet with many more turns of nutrition than they provide to you. It is thus optimal to save these items for a herbivorous pet, if you have any, rather than consuming them yourself. Feeding also affects the [[tameness]] and [[apport]] of a pet.

500 [[turn]]s after becoming hungry, a pet will temporarily lose two thirds of its max hp, become [[Confusion#Monster confusion|confused]], and will be willing to eat some food it would not otherwise eat.  Pets who run out of nutrition points completely (250 [[turn]]s after becoming confused) will die if they are on the same dungeon level as you, and otherwise they will go [[feral]].  If the pet went feral while suffering from hit point reduction, the hit point reduction becomes permanent.  If you leave their level before the hit point reduction, and only return to their level after they go feral, their hit points will not be reduced.  [[Chat]]ting with a pet often gives a clue about its nutrition level. If a pet is about to starve, and you have no way to feed it, one way to save its life is to abandon the dungeon level and come back later once you have a way of re-taming the pet. This works especially well with [[domestic]] animals, which are easy to [[tame]].  To preserve your pet's max hit points, leave the level before the pet becomes confused, and stay away until after it would starve.  

If a hungry pet eats, it will first become not hungry, then receive nutrition; this applies even with food that gives zero nutrition, such as a [[wraith]] corpse.

==Strategy==

Starvation is a common cause of death during the early stages of the game. Here are some tips for maintaining a healthy caloric intake. This discussion concerns only quantitative aspects of nutrition; for a more sophisticated overview of the relative qualitative advantages of different types of food, see the article on [[Comestibles#Food strategy|food]].

The most basic advice is, of course, to eat - always [[pick up]] and retain non-perishable comestibles where possible. Monster corpses are perishable, so when a monster dies, [[eat]] its [[corpse]] immediately if the corpse is safe to eat. Novice players often forget to eat corpses when the opportunity presents itself, and end up dying of starvation as a result. However, don't eat too much, as this may abuse [[dexterity]] and there is the risk of choking to death. You will also want to avoid overeating if you still lack some [[intrinsics]] that you'd like to get from eating corpses.

Your pet, if you have one, will often eat monster corpses before you have a chance to get to them. To mitigate this problem, stand next to the monster while your pet is fighting, and pounce on the corpse afterwards. This works best if you are [[fast]] or if you can [[magic whistle|whistle]] away your pets; you can also kill another nearby monster. [[Inediate]] pets will not cause this problem.

Once you reach either [[Minetown]] or [[Sokoban]], you will most likely encounter a lot of food; Minetown often has a deli of some sort, and most randomly generated items in Sokoban are comestibles. Some players prefer to descend quickly to either destination for a lasting supply of food. Generally speaking, Minetown is easier to reach if you are playing a [[dwarf]] or a [[gnome]], and Sokoban is easier otherwise.

If you have the [[stone to flesh]] spell, you can cast it on [[boulder]]s to turn them into [[huge chunk of meat|huge chunks of meat]], which provide 2000 points of nutrition. [[Healer]]s are guaranteed to start with this spell.

In an emergency, if you are not trying for an [[atheist]] conduct, you can [[pray]] while weak to restore your nutrition status, provided that it is safe to pray. Since all games start with an initial prayer timeout of 300 turns, this means that, unless you do something out of the ordinary (such as receiving a [[wish]]), you can always pray safely after 300 turns. However, prayer is a very useful tool, which you may want to save for other things.

The [[foodless]] article describes a number of the more obscure ways of gaining nutrition without consuming food.

== History ==

Before [[NetHack 3.6.1]], being fainted did not reduce energy consumption (only being asleep did), and to compensate, the nutrition threshold at which you starved to death was double its current value.

The '''wand of fire''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
A [[Wizard]] may receive a wand of fire as part of their starting inventory.

There is a 4% chance that a [[Wand#Generation|randomly-generated wand]] within the dungeon and its branches will be a wand of fire. Monsters may generate with the wand as a random [[offensive item]].

[[Asmodeus]] [[Monster starting inventory|will always generate with]] a [[wand of cold]] and a wand of fire.{{refsrc|makemon.c|643}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|772|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Effects==
[[Zap]]ping the wand in a given direction emits a [[ray]] of fire that does 6d6 damage to non-[[fire resistance|fire resistant]] targets, with a +7 bonus if the monster has [[cold resistance]].{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3629|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Monsters hit with this ray may have their inventory set aflame: [[potions]] may boil, [[scrolls]] and [[spellbooks]] may burn, and organic [[armor]] may smoulder. The ray bounces when it hits walls or targets with [[reflection]]; it can melt any squares of [[ice]] it travels over, destroy any [[door]]s it colid and evaporates [[pool]]s of water.

[[Engraving]] with a wand of fire will [[auto-identify]] the wand.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Rays of fire that partially or completely evaporate pools or moats will generate [[cloud]]s of steam.}}

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Wand strategy]]''
The wand of fire is a useful offensive item against most monsters that can prove just as deadly to you, especially early on where you typically lack a source of [[reflection]] or fire resistance. It can be especially deadly against vulnerable monsters if you have a means of rebounding or reflecting the ray back at them.

A wand of fire is a popular means of engraving [[Elbereth]] - such engravings are permanent and can only be removed by making it vanish (with a [[wand of cancellation]], wand of cold or [[wand of make invisible|make invisible]]), [[wand of teleportation|teleporting it]], [[wand of polymorph|polymorphing it]], or overwriting it (with a [[wand of lightning]] or another wand of fire). The wand can also be used to destroy the [[door]] to the [[Sokoban]] zoo without waking up ''all'' of its inhabitants.

In addition to holding off tougher hostiles, wands of fire can also be used to cut them off or dispose of them directly - you can lure an earthbound monster onto ice (e.g. moats frozen with a wand of cold) and then zap a wand of fire to melt it from beneath them, drowning them instantly. Beware, though: monsters using this wand can possibly do the same to you, which is a danger for [[Valkyrie]]s on their [[Valkyrie quest|quest]] in particular. A wand of fire can also be used to strand [[sea monster]]s and prevent drowning from [[giant eel]]s or [[electric eel]]s, though this only works if the monster is in a moat.

In an emergency where you are afflicted with [[sliming]], zapping the wand at yourself can save you - though it may also damage your armor and inventory, it is much preferable to ending your game as a slime.

==History==
The wand of fire has been present in the game since Hack 1.21, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], [[Flame Mage]]s start the game with a wand of fire.

[[Grund's Stronghold]] has a [[hobgoblin]] with a wand of fire in the open area, and the [[soldier]] that appears in the front corridors has a 60% chance of being generated with a wand of fire.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], on top [[SLASH'EM]] changes, all [[Firefighter]]s start with a wand of fire.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], which incorporates the [[Wands Balance Patch]], unskilled usage of a wand of fire chooses the lesser of two values to deal as damage: 3d6 or 40% max HP damage.

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], which incorporates the [[Wands Balance Patch]], unskilled usage of a wand of fire also chooses the lesser of two values to deal as damage: 3d6 or 40% max HP damage.

The wand of lightning is itself immune to destruction by lightning rays and sources of shock damage (e.g. chest traps, a returning [[Mjollnir]], [[energy vortices]] or [[electric eel]]s), and the [[ring of shock resistance]] is also immune to rays of lightning.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|5112|nethack=3.6.7}}

Like a [[wand of fire]], [[engraving]] with a wand of lightning will burn text into the ground and [[auto-identify]] it; however, doing so will blind you for d50 turns unless you are already blind or resist blindness.{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|791|nethack=3.6.7}}{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|1162|nethack=3.6.7}} You can avoid this by cancelling the prompt when asked what to engrave.{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|1034|nethack=3.6.7|comment=cancelling the prompt causes <code>doengrave()</code> to return early}}

[[Apply]]ing a wand of lightning to break it creates an explosion that deals quadruple the normal damage of applying other wands to yourself and all monsters on surrounding squares, and may destroy rings and wands.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|3367|nethack=3.6.7}}

==Strategy==
Wands of lightning are a powerful offensive item through much of the game, since very few monsters resist shock; however, it is just as devastating to you should you encounter one in the hands of [[GWTWOD|an early-game monster]], and can prove to be an annoyance later on if a [[soldier]] or another monster surprises you with a bolt that destroys valuable rings such as {{= of|slow digestion}}. [[Reflection]] is naturally the best defense after shock resistance against monsters with wands of lightning, but it also helps to have a means of curing blindness (e.g. a [[unicorn horn]]) and a way to safely stash your magical items.

A wand of lightning can be useful to blast apart annoying wands in a hostile monster's inventory, such as a [[wand of digging]] used by a constantly-fleeing opponent; conversely, avoid using the wand on monsters that have wands and rings you wish to preserve, such as a [[wand of death]] or rings of {{= of|levitation|and=1|free action}}.

Breaking a wand of lightning can be powerful as a means of crowd control, but will also deal immense damage to you unless you are shock-resistant, and will also endanger valuable rings and wands in your inventory. If doing so, be sure to briefly stash whatever vulnerable items you have in a bag or other container, ''unless'' you either have none or are otherwise [[Things To Do If You're Going to Die Next Turn|going to die soon]].

The wand of lightning is also a very useful tool to engrave a durable [[Elbereth]] well into even the late-game, particularly for [[pacifist]] [[conduct]] where you will be reliant on such engravings to deter hostile monsters.

==History==
The wand of lightning first appears in [[NetHack 2.3e]].

The '''wand of cold''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
A [[Wizard]] may receive a wand of cold as part of their starting inventory.

There is a 4% chance that a [[Wand#Generation|randomly-generated wand]] within the dungeon and its branches will be a wand of cold. Monsters may generate with the wand as a random [[offensive item]].

[[Asmodeus]] [[Monster starting inventory|will always generate with]] a wand of cold and a [[wand of fire]].{{refsrc|makemon.c|643}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|772|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Effects==
[[Zap]]ping the wand in a given direction emits a [[ray]] of ice that deals 6d6 damage to non-[[cold resistance|cold resistant]] targets, with a +6d3 bonus if the monster has [[fire resistance]].{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3649|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Monsters hit with this ray have a {{frac|3}} chance of any [[potion]]s in their inventory freezing and shattering. The ray bounces when it hits walls or targets with [[reflection]]; it will also freeze any [[moat]] of water it travels over into [[ice]], and [[lava]] is cooled and solidified into normal rock.

[[Engraving]] with a wand of cold will cause a few ice cubes to drop from the wand; this message is unique to the wand, but does not [[auto-identify]] it. Doing so over a burned engraving will make it vanish.

[[Apply]]ing a wand of cold to break it will create a damaging magical explosion of cold in a 3×3 square centered on you. See [[breaking wands]] for details.

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Wand strategy]]''
The wand of cold is a useful offensive item against most monsters that can prove just as deadly to you, especially early on where you typically lack a source of [[reflection]] or cold resistance. It can be especially deadly against vulnerable monsters if you have a means of rebounding or reflecting the ray back at them.

In scenarios where a player lacks a [[levitation]] source or [[water walking boots]], a wand of cold with sufficient charges can be a good choice if you need to cross water (e.g., gaining entrance to the [[Castle]], entering the throne room in [[Fort Ludios]]) or lava (e.g., the lower floors of the [[Valkyrie quest]]). Ice can prove slippery to many characters and may potentially melt away, raising the possibility of being stranded - additionally, be careful of monsters with [[fire]] attacks! When crossing water or lava using this wand, try to make the shortest ice bridges possible in order to conserve charges.

In the event of much larger crossings, such as [[Medusa's Island]] in most cases, zapping a [[wand of digging]] downward is usually a better idea. You might even choose to continue to the Castle, collect its loot and the [[wand of wishing]], and come back up through Medusa's downstair with better equipment;<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_frm/thread/5249395885b1cbbe A ttyrec about the Castle drawbridge] by [[User:Eidolos|Eidolos]]</ref> very rarely, you may want to head even further down to [[Vlad's Tower]] for the guaranteed water walking boots.

A wand of cold can be used to destroy the [[door]] to the [[Sokoban]] zoo without waking up ''all'' of its inhabitants. The wand can also serve as a valuable offensive/escape item against [[sea monster]]s such as [[giant eels|giant]] and [[electric eels]] while crossing water: freezing the water they're in will strand them on the surface, weakening them - and in the eels' cases, rendering them unable to [[drown]] you - until they re-enter water. Additionally, wand of cold can also be used to retrieve any of the [[invocation item]]s from moats of water or [[lava]] by freezing it - the invocation item will then appear on top.

==History==
The wand of cold has been present in the game since Hack 1.21, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

==Message==
{{message|A few ice cubes drop from the wand.|You engraved something on the floor with a wand of cold.}}

==Variants==
In many variants, engraving with the wand of cold will auto-identify it.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], [[Ice Mage]]s start the game with a wand of cold.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], which incorporates the [[Wands Balance Patch]], unskilled usage of a wand of cold chooses the lesser of two values to deal as damage: 3d6 or 40% max HP damage.

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], which incorporates the [[Wands Balance Patch]], unskilled usage of a wand of cold also chooses the lesser of two values to deal as damage: 3d6 or 40% max HP damage.

Some [[item]]s, like [[wand]]s, [[magic harp]]s, [[horn of plenty|horns of plenty]], [[brass lantern]]s and the [[Bell of Opening]] are only effective for a finite number of uses. Each potential use is called a '''charge''', and '''charging''' is the process of adding more charges to an item. The most common methods of charging are the [[scroll of charging]] and [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]].

Such items are shown with two numbers at the end of their description when fully [[identification|identified]], e.g. <tt>a wand of magic missile (0:5)</tt>. The first number is how many times the item has been recharged, and the second is the number of charges remaining. The recharge counter stops at <tt>(7:y)</tt>,{{refsrc|read.c|302}} though the item can still be recharged further if applicable. A discharged item is <tt>(x:0)</tt>, and a [[Cancellation|canceled]] item is <tt>(x:-1)</tt>.

Repeated charging is potentially problematic. A [[wand]] charged more than once might explode; this is why nearly all players reduce a wand to 0 charges before charging it. A [[wand of wishing]] charged the second time always explodes; thus [[player]]s with a wand of wishing (1:0) should always [[Wresting|wrest]] the last wish (zap the wand repeatedly) instead of charging.

== Wands ==

[[File:NHC-Wand-Charging-Odds.png|thumb|n<sup>3</sup> / 343]]If a wand has been recharged at least once before, there is a chance it might explode, destroying itself. A [[wand of wishing]] always explodes if recharged more than once. For other wands, the chance of an explosion is <tt>n<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;/&nbsp;343</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is the number of times the wand has been recharged before. This is summarized in the following table:{{refsrc|read.c|227}}

{| class="prettytable"
! Times recharged !! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7
|-
! Chance of exploding
| (never) || 0.29% || 2.33% || 7.87% || 18.66% || 36.44% || 62.97% || (always)
|}

And the combined, cumulative probability of working towards maximum charges:
[[File:NHC-Cumulative-Wand-Charging-Odds.png|thumb|Cumulative]]

{| class="prettytable"
! Times recharged !! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7
|-
! Cumulative chance
| (never) || 0.29% || 2.62% || 10.28% || 27.02% || 53.62% || 82.83% || (always)
|}

And thus the expected average, per wand, is 5.2334 charges before the wand explodes.
<!-- ' Linear interpolation.
Interpolate(L,x,y) = (x*(1-L)+y*L)
	Function Interpolate(L,x,y) is defined
' Find where 50% lies between 0 and 1.
50/(27.02+53.62)
	Ans = 0.620039683
' Interpolate between 4 and 5, ~62% of the way.
Interpolate(Ans,4,5)
	Ans = 4.620039683 -->

An exploding wand deals between <tt>1</tt> and <tt>2(maxhp+1)/3</tt> damage,{{refsrc|read.c|1304}} so don't risk it if you're below full HP or in a place that isn't safe.

If the wand does not explode, it gains some charges.

Blessed charging picks a number of charges between the wand's natural maximum charges and <tt>(max&nbsp;charges&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4)</tt> inclusive, with all values having equal probability,{{refsrc|read.c|257|name=charge_target}} excluding wands of wishing for which 3 is always chosen.<ref name="charge_target"/>{{refsrc|read.c|254}} This is summarized by the following probability table:

{| class="prettytable" style="text-align: center;"
! rowspan=2|Wand type !! colspan=15|Number chosen
|-
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15

|-
! non-directional
| || || || || || || || || || || 20% || 20% || 20% || 20% || 20%
|}

Uncursed charging chooses a number in the same way as blessed charging, then reduces the number to a value between 1 and the chosen number inclusive.{{refsrc|read.c|258}} The net result is summarized by the following probability table:

{| class="prettytable" style="text-align: center;"
! rowspan=2|Wand type !! colspan=15|Number chosen
|-
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15

|}

For both blessed and unblessed charging, the wand's number of charges is set to the chosen value.{{refsrc|read.c|260}} If the wand already has that many charges (or more), it instead gains one charge.{{refsrc|read.c|261}} If this extra charge brings a wand of wishing to more than 3 charges, it explodes.{{refsrc|read.c|262}} (Other wands  glow blue if charged beyond their natural maximum, but suffer no ill effects.{{refsrc|read.c|266}})

Cursed charging sets the wand's number of charges to 0, unless the wand itself is blessed. This happens even if the wand was at <tt>(x:-1)</tt>, i.e. it was canceled.{{refsrc|read.c|224}}

== Rings ==

[[Ring]]s with numerical enchantment levels&mdash;namely, [[ring of adornment|adornment]], [[ring of gain strength|gain strength]], [[ring of gain constitution|gain constitution]], [[ring of increase accuracy|increase accuracy]], [[ring of increase damage|increase damage]], and [[ring of protection|protection]]&mdash;may be charged to alter their enchantment.

Before the ring is charged, there is a chance it might explode. A +''n'' ring has an {{frac|''n''|7}} probability of exploding if 0 < ''n'' < 7, or a 100% probability if ''n'' &le; -5 or ''n'' &ge; 7. An exploding ring deals 1d(3&times;|''n''|) damage to the player.{{refsrc|read.c|270}}  If the ring does not explode, its enchantment is updated according to the scroll's BUC, with blessed charging adding 1&ndash;3 points, uncursed charging adding 1, and cursed charging subtracting 1&ndash;2 points.

== Tools ==

All chargeable [[tool]]s may be recharged any number of times without ill effect, with the exception of magic markers.

For all tools, cursed charging reduces the number of charges to 0, unless the item itself is blessed, in which case nothing will happen.

{|class="wikitable"
!Tool !! Uncursed charging adds !! Blessed charging adds !! Maximum !! Notes
|-
| [[Bell of Opening]] || 1 || d3 || 5 ||
|-
| [[tinning kit]], [[expensive camera]], [[magic marker]] || 10-20 || 15-30 || 127 ||
* If blessed charging and charges are greater than 50 but less than 75, round up to 75.
* If blessed or uncursed charging and charges are less than 50, round up to 50.
* Magic markers that have already been recharged will not charge again, and if 3 or fewer charges remain on an already-recharged marker, they are lost.
|-

|-
| [[oil lamp]], [[brass lantern]] || 750 || 1500 || 1500 || Dipping an oil lamp in a [[potion of oil]] also fills it to 1500, though this is not magical charging.
|}

== Yourself ==

If you read a [[scroll of charging]] while [[confused]], your [[energy]] is replenished to its maximum. If it was already at maximum, the maximum is increased by ''5d4'', and your current energy is increased to the new maximum.{{refsrc|read.c|1057}}

The confused effect only applies to the scroll of charging. Invoking [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]] while confused still produces the regular charging effect.

&&%s&& %s Dungeon level {145346 2022-04-04T11:59:37Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''dungeon level''' or '''depth''' represents how many levels you are beneath the surface. The dungeon level is closely related to a different number, '''level difficulty'''. Normally this is the same as the dungeon level, but has a few special cases:

# In branches such as [[Sokoban]] that go upwards, the level difficulty increases as depth decreases. For instance, if the stairway to Sokoban is on dungeon level 9, the first level of Sokoban will have a level difficulty of 10, and the second will be 11, etc.
# If you are carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]], level difficulty is the depth of the deepest level you have reached (which will always be the [[Sanctum]] in normal play).
# If you are in the [[Planes]], level difficulty is the depth of the Sanctum ''plus'' half your [[experience level]]. {{refsrc|src/dungeon.c|1590|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Effects of depth==
Depth is shown in-game at the far left of the [[status line]], as "Dlvl". You start the game on dungeon level 1, where it might read:

 Dlvl:1  $:1699 HP:13(13) Pw:5(5) AC:8  Xp:1/0 T:1

Depth influences:
* The number of gold pieces that generate in random piles and [[vault]]s.
* Whether a shop square will generate a [[mimic]] instead of a real item.
* Whether a mimic will appear as a [[strange object]] instead of successfully mimicking something else.
* How many [[Keystone Kops]] show up when you rob a [[shop]].
* Whether [[closet]]s will generate [[level teleporter]]s and [[trap door]]s.
* Whether a given room in the Dungeons of Doom will contain a random [[grave]] or [[graffiti]].
* Whether a given room in the Dungeons of Doom will be lit or dark.
* Which types of [[special room]] a given Dungeons of Doom level is eligible for, and specifically the probability there will be a [[shop]].
* How much [[gold]] will be buried in stone.
* Whether a level can have the [[Fort Ludios]] portal on it.
* Whether a level will create [[bones]] if you die on it.

==Effects of level difficulty==
Level difficulty influences:

* The monsters that are eligible to [[Monster creation|generate randomly]], as well as which monsters are eligible to generate, when a single monster class is specified.
* The experience level of generated monsters.
* The number of gold pieces that generate in random piles, graves, [[container]]s, monsters' starting inventory, [[leprechaun hall]]s, and [[treasure zoo]]s.
* Whether a randomly generated [[statue]] will contain a random [[spellbook]].
* Whether a [[water demon]] from a fountain will give you a wish instead of attacking.
* The number of undead monsters appear when you [[raise the dead]].
* Which monsters are eligible to appear in a [[graveyard]], [[throne room]], or [[barracks]].
* Whether you succeed when you try to disarm a trap on a container or a trapped door.
* The amount of damage an exploding door or tin does.
* Whether a door will be trapped (or a mimic).
* The amount of traps that appear in a given room in the Dungeons of Doom, and which kinds of trap are eligible.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Level difficulty also influences which [[themed rooms]] are eligible to generate, and sometimes also influences the contents of a room.}}

NetHack's '''user interface''' is primarily [[ASCII]]. [[Graphical user interface|Graphical interfaces]] based on [[Tileset|tiles]] are available for nearly all platforms, and some platforms have exotic interfaces such as [[Falcon's Eye]], [[Vulture's Eye]] and [[glHack]].

Even using only [[ASCII]], the [[curses interface]] provides much of the convenience normally associated with windowing systems. It is available on the [[public server]] [[NAO]].

A screenshot of the ASCII interface is below. Click on some parts to find out what they mean.

Font size and some other aspects of NetHack's user interface are actually configured in your terminal emulator, e.g. on Windows: [[PuTTY]] or the default terminal (aka command prompt).

Because this is a [[wiki]], anyone can edit and change almost any page. However, to help make NetHackWiki a useful and interesting place for ''[[NetHack]]'' players, we ask for you to:

# Be a NetHack player
# Read about [[MediaWikiWiki:Help:Formatting|wiki markup]]
#* Optionally, practice editing in our [[NetHackWiki:sandbox|sandbox]]
# [[Special:Userlogin|Create an account]]
# Read our [[style guide]]

That is all! Step 4 is important, as a consistent look and feel helps other readers use the wiki.

==TODO list==

If you want something done and won't or can't do it yourself, try adding it to one of the following lists, or mark the relevant page with a {{tl|todo}} notice.

===Move-related tasks===
* Check your bookmarks and your website: do they point to the new wiki, https://nethackwiki.com? (Tools: [http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p=nethack.wikia.com&bwm=i&bwmo=d&bwmf=s Links to deprecated wiki], [http://www.google.de/cse/home?cx=017829446202303040675:rwiagmyju-y search within])

===General tasks===

* Fix typos
* Turn awkward grammar into beautiful prose
* Do something from the [[:Category:Todo|Todo list]]
* Create a [[Special:Wantedpages|page that doesn't exist yet]]
* Browse the [[NetHackWiki:Categories|category tree]] and find a place for uncategorised [[Special:Uncategorizedpages|pages]], [[Special:Uncategorizedimages|images]] and [[Special:Uncategorizedcategories|categories]]
* Fix [[Special:DoubleRedirects|double redirects]], if any
* Choose a [[:Category:Stubs|stub article]] and expand it
* [[Style_guide#Source_code|Add source code footnotes]] for specific NetHack facts
* If you are a [[source diver]], annotate some [[source code]]
* Welcome anonymous users by placing "<nowiki>{{subst:welcome}} --~~~~</nowiki>" on their talk page
* Participate in discussions at the [[NetHackWiki:Community Portal|Community Portal]]

===Specific tasks===
{{Todo|Perhaps ironically, this list is out of date. Many of the items were added in 2006. The list should be rewritten. Alternatively, it may be better to rely on the Todo notice/category.}}
* There are still many [[ring]]/[[wand]]/[[potion]]/[[scroll]]/[[spellbook]] articles which are either non-existent or very short stubs. Expand them!
* We have "best" solutions for [[sokoban]] (those leaving no boulders immobile); we should also have fastest solutions.
* Many [[special level]]s have yet to be mapped, as they are in the Gazetteer.
* The [[role]] articles need more structure and a lot more detail.
* We (and, in fact, the net in general) have very few articles about [[SLASH'EM]] (but see [[Style_guide#SLASH.27EM|the style guide on this]]).
* We have no complete articles about past tournaments and winners.
* We lack [[GUI|screenshots]] of NetHack running on exotic platforms.
* Many [[property|properties]] have no complete articles.

===Automatable tasks===

If you're good with scripts, or just have a thing for mind-numbing repetitive chores, you can do something on this list:

* The pages for [[weapon]], [[armor]], [[comestible]], [[monster]] etc. are currently just lists. They could at least be tables showing some basic stats, and possibly even a series of tables ordered by different properties, e.g.:
** [[Weapons (by damage to large monsters)]]
** [[Weapons (by weight)]]
** [[Monsters (by difficulty)]]
** [[Monsters (by speed)]]
** [[Monsters (by alignment)]]

== Other wiki help ==
* [[m:Help:Contents|MediaWiki Handbook]] has technical documentation about the wiki software

A '''touchstone''' is one of four [[gray stone]]s that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

== Generation ==
Archaeologists always start with an uncursed touchstone, and one is always generated in the inventory of a jewelery [[shop]]'s [[shopkeeper]].{{refsrc|src/shknam.c|671|nethack=3.6.0}}

==Effects==
The touchstone is used to identify [[gems]] by [[apply]]ing the touchstone or [[rubbing]] a [[gem]] on it. A [[blessed]] touchstone will immediately [[identify]] the gem, as will an uncursed one in the hands of an [[archeologist]] or [[gnome (starting race)|gnome]];{{refsrc|src/apply.c|2226|nethack=3.6.0}} this includes both worthless glass and other gray stones, and will also [[auto-identify]] the touchstone. A non-blessed touchstone will merely distinguish glass from gems; valuable gems will leave streaks of the gem's color, while glass will leave scratch marks. A cursed touchstone has a {{frac|5}} chance of shattering gems that are rubbed on it.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|2196|nethack=3.6.0}}

Using a touchstone while [[hallucinating]] will produce [[YAFM]] without identifying the gem.

== Identification ==
Rubbing an [[iron]] item on the touchstone will produce a signature "scritch, scritch" noise, which is the most reliable means of identifying the stone. Rubbing any gem on the touchstone will produce the same noise as the result if you are [[blind]]. They can also be identified by price, being the only gray stone with a 45 base price.

==Strategy==
Blessed touchstones allow you to sell fully identified gems for full price and get the full [[luck]] bonus for throwing them to [[unicorn]]s. For uncursed touchstones, if you formally identify glass from watching the messages, you should type-[[name]] the glass before discarding it to avoid the need for redundant testing. You may then use a [[scroll of identify]] to formally identify the valuable gems if you do not wish to bless your touchstone.

Rubbing a gem or glass on any other gray stone will make colored scratch marks.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|2276|nethack=3.6.0}} Therefore, rubbing a gem or glass on an unidentified gray stone can identify a touchstone (colored streaks or scratch marks) from other gray stones (colored scratch marks).

An unidentified touchstone can be used to distinguish metal objects from non-metal objects using the aforementioned signature noise, but this strategy is somewhat obscure and of limited use. [[Gauntlets of power]] and [[kicking boots]] are the only items in the game that can be distinguished in this way, potentially serving some use in narrowing down the identity of other gloves or boots.

While hallucinating prevents you from actually using a touchstone to identify gems, attempting to do so will produce a specific message that can indirectly identify an unused gray stone as a touchstone.

==Messages==
{{message|You see <color> streaks on the stone.|You rubbed a valuable gem on a touchstone.}}
{{message|You make scratch marks on the stone.|You rubbed a piece of worthless glass on a touchstone.}} 
{{message|You make <color> scratch marks on the stone.|You rubbed a gem on a non-touchstone gray stone.}}
{{message|Oh wow, man: Fractals!|You tried to use a touchstone while hallucinating.}}

== SLASH'EM ==
In [[SLASH'EM]], touchstones can only be used on gems.
