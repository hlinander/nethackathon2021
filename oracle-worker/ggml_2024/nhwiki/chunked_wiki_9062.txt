A '''C-ration''' is a kind of [[comestible]] that appears in ''[[Nethack]]''. Similar to a [[K-ration]], it can be eaten in one move, and is suitable for [[vegan]]s.

==Generation==
[[Yendorian Army]] fighters have a {{frac|2}} chance of [[monster starting inventory|being generated with]] a C-ration.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|668|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
C-rations can be eaten in one move, making them valuable for quick nutrition in desperate situations, and are plentiful if you can clear out [[barracks]], such as those found in [[Fort Ludios]] and the [[Castle]]. However, K-rations and C-rations are almost effectively identical, except that K-rations have a higher nutrition value - this makes them the preferred food to stock for the [[Astral Plane]].

==History==
The C-ration first appears in [[NetHack 2.3e]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}

C-rations are a real-world ration type issued to U.S. military soldiers from 1938–1958 (the current issue is the [[wikipedia:Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] ration), most notably during [[wikipedia:World War II|World War II]]. They were very simple fare that quickly gained a reputation for being monotonous.<ref>http://www.usarmymodels.com/ARTICLES/Rations/crations.html</ref>  

Each meal consisted of two cans, a "B" or bread unit and an "M" or meat unit, with a day's rations consisting of three such meals.  As the name suggests, the "M" units contained meat, and even the contents of the "B" units were generally not vegan.

The '''wand of make invisible''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
[[Monsters]] may be generated with a wand of make invisible as a [[miscellaneous item]].

==Effects==
Zapping the wand at a monster makes them [[invisible]]; zapping this wand at a peaceful monster will anger it. If you zap it at yourself, you become permanently invisible, unless you are wearing a [[mummy wrapping]]. Zapping the wand downward will make any [[engraving]] on that [[square]] disappear, as does engraving with it.  

==Strategy==
{{main|Invisibility}}
If you do not yet have a method to enter shops, e.g. a mummy wrapping, you might want to keep this wand in case you get a fresh [[stalker]] corpse; eating one while already invisible will grant the [[see invisible]] [[intrinsic]] and make you permanently invisible, which you already will be as a result of the wand.

Once a [[player]] is permanently invisible, this wand normally has little use; making your non-steed [[pets]] invisible does not give them a combat advantage. Pacifists will see lots of [[floating eye]]s, and may want the wand to make them invisible and render them safe for their pet to kill.

==Variants==
In [[SLASH'EM]], wands of make invisible can also [[Invisible item (SLASH'EM)|make objects invisible]]. This simplifies the process of identifying the wand.

A '''wand of undead turning''' is a type of [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. 

==Generation==
The wand of undead turning makes up 5% of all randomly generated wands.

==Description==
A wand of undead turning has two functions: [[Zap]]ping an [[undead]] monster deals 1d8 points of damage and will cause the creature to [[flee]] from you. This damage is doubled if you are a [[Knight]] carrying the [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]]. Alternatively, the wand can be used to '''unturn dead''',<ref>{{function|zap.c|unturn_dead}}</ref> [[revive|reviving]] [[corpse]]s and rejuvenating [[egg]]s, though limitations apply. Monsters will not use this wand.

A [[Healer]] that is blind and using the wand to revive a corpse will formally identify the wand if they are not [[deaf]].{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2032|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Intelligent monsters with hands that have a wand of undead turning will zap [[you]] with it if you are carrying any [[corpses]], including [[lizard]] corpses or wielded [[cockatrice]] corpses. When they do, one corpse from each stack you are carrying will be revived.}}

==Strategy==
One of the most common uses for this wand is to revive the corpse of a killed [[pet]], though it may need to be re-tamed depending on their previous [[tameness]] and [[pet abuse]]; another somewhat common use is to revive  corpses that are too old to [[eat]] or else #[[offer]] as sacrifices. In both cases, be mindful of [[Corpse#Corpse generation odds|corpse generation odds]] - there's no guarantee that the monster will leave a corpse a second time unless they are of sufficient [[physical size]] (i.e. large or bigger).

Though it may be tempting to farm [[unicorns]] and [[dragons]] for their [[unicorn horn|horns]] and [[dragon scales|scales]], this is not as useful as it sounds: revived unicorns have a 50% chance of not dropping an extra horn at all, and the horns that do drop will count as non-magical tools for [[polypiling]] purposes; revived dragons will only drop scales 5% of the time.

===Identification===
{{main|Engrave-test}}
[[Engraving]] with a wand of undead turning generates no message or effect - if you zap a wand that has no message or effect at yourself and reanimate a corpse in your inventory, [[stun]] yourself while undead, or else get a specific message, the wand is unambiguously undead turning.

==History==
The wand of undead turning first appears in PDP-11, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

The method for Healers to identify the wand was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].{{refsrc|src/zap.c|1890|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

==Messages==
{{message|You shudder in dread.|You zapped a wand of undead turning at yourself, and there were no corpses in your inventory.}}

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], engraving with a wand of undead turning will give the following message:

{{message|The dead bugs on the floor start moving!}}

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], [[Undertaker]]s start each game with a wand of undead turning.

The '''biodiversity patch''' is a very large patch that adds several new [[monster]]s and contains other changes by Nicholas Webb. The current version is 1.2a for [[NetHack 3.4.3]]. For more information, visit the [http://web.archive.org/web/20041209022619/http://userfs.cec.wustl.edu/~naw1/nh/nh_bio.html biodiversity patch's home page].

The biodiversity patch also incorporates three patches from other authors, including the [[Heck² patch]], the [[photography patch]] and a coin-flipping patch.

T. J. Brumfield is working on a port of this patch to ''[[SLASH'EM]]''; see the [http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.games.roguelike.nethack.slashem.devel slashem-devel archive] for October 2007.

==Bestiary==

===New monsters===
The biodiversity patch slightly expands several [[monster class]]es that have very few members, or only a single member, in [[vanilla]].

===Changes to existing monsters===
* The [[steam vortex]]'s [[engulf]]ing attack is now coded as '''scalding''' rather than [[fire]] damage.
* [[Gnome]]s (and [[bat]]s) use '''echolocation''' instead of [[infravision]].
* [[Quantum mechanic]]s (and clockwork automata) may be [[Call|name]]d after historical figures.
* [[Rope golem]]s drop [[leash]]es when destroyed.
* [[Straw golem]]s drop sheaves of hay when destroyed.  They may also drop a [[Erosion|damaged]] [[fedora]].  (Clothing for a scarecrow?)
* [[Iron golem]]s drop cogwheels and [[large shield]]s when destroyed, in addition to [[iron chain]]s.  Clockwork automata drop cogwheels and sprockets.  These belong to the {{white|_}} [[item class]] (renamed 'useless item') and can be used as improvised weapons.
* [[Guide]]s, the [[Tourist]] [[quest guardian]]s, now offer services to players.

New names:

* The color and name of the [[Knight quest]] [[quest nemesis|nemesis]] have been changed.  [[Ixoth]] is now the white-colored '''Hwitwyrm''', an allusion to [[Wikipedia:White dragon|Welsh folklore]].  The dragon's attacks and attributes remain the same.
* The [[Chromatic Dragon]] is renamed '''Tiamat'''.
* All regular dragons except the [[gray dragon]] have new names.  (These are not randomized, as in [[UnNetHack]].)
** [[Silver dragon]]: ''Amphitere''
** [[Red dragon]]: ''Firedrake''
** [[White dragon]]: ''Lindworm''
** [[Orange dragon]]: ''Lung dragon''
** [[Black dragon]]: ''Sirrush''
** [[Blue dragon]]: ''Leviathan''
** [[Green dragon]]: ''Wyvern''
** [[Yellow dragon]]: ''Guivre''
* The [[large kobold]] and [[kobold lord]] are renamed '''kobold hewer''' and '''kobold chieftain'''.  The hewer can [[tunnel]] if it has a [[Pickaxe|pick]].
* The [[water nymph]] and [[wood nymph]] are renamed '''naiad''' and '''dryad'''.

New appearances:

* [[Tiger]]s are now colored orange ({{orange|f}}) instead of yellow ({{yellow|f}}), to distinguish them from the sphinx.

==Other changes==
===Levels===
* Many [[quest]] home levels are now considered to be "outdoors", with "sky" overhead instead of a "ceiling".  On these levels [[dart trap]]s will be created instead of [[falling rock trap]]s.
* The [[Priest quest]] branch may have a [[Biodiversity patch/Priest quest|different home level design]], depending on which [[pantheon]] the player was assigned at the beginning of the game.
* [[Tree]]s which produce specific [[fruit]] have been added.  There are also oak trees which produce acorns, and elven dogwoods (used to make elven wooden weapons).

===Items===
* A golden wand has been added to the list of [[randomized appearance]]s for wands, as an item that the gold bug can eat.
* Using a [[wand of light]] to #[[engrave]] produces glowing writing.
* [[Amber]] may contain fossilized [[xan]]s or [[spider]]s, which can be revived with [[stone to flesh]].

===Gameplay===
* [[Samurai]] know the corpses of [[sea monster]]s by their corresponding Japanese culinary names.
* [[Orc (starting race)|Orc]]s can saddle and [[ride]] [[warg]]s, instead of [[horse]]s.

==Legacy==
[[UnNetHack]] and some other variants incorporate part of this patch, most notably the [[disintegrator]], a much more dangerous cousin of the [[rust monster]] and the [[disenchanter]].  Some of the new names for generic dragons are also used in UnNetHack, but their breath types and resistances are randomized at the beginning of the game.

[[dNetHack]] includes clockwork automata, both as a monster and [[Clockwork Automaton (starting race)|as a playable race]].

Versions of most of the monsters appear in [[SlashTHEM]].

&&%s&& %s Variant {148211 2022-09-22T15:59:58Z {4000354 Chris} /* dNetHack */ Update current version. [[File:VariantHistoryGraph.jpg|thumb|The history of NetHack variant development in all its convoluted glory, as of February 2020. Black arrows indicate direct descent from a whole codebase; gray indicate inspiration or scattered features copied in.]]

A '''variant''' (also sometimes known as a fork, mod, or patchset) is a copy of ''NetHack'' to which substantial code changes have been made.

Most variants make changes to the gameplay, but this isn't a requirement: [[NitroHack]], for instance, is a variant which makes huge code changes but does not change gameplay at all.

The [[NetHack General Public License]] allows anyone to create a variant, provided that they use the same license. Then, features from that variant may be reused in other variants!

Variants are distinct from [[patch]]es. A variant typically contains a large amount of changes and has a broader goal, whereas a patch does one specific thing and contains only the changes required to make it work. Some variants were formed by applying multiple existing patches to the vanilla source code.

A variant is either distributed as a very large patch against vanilla ''NetHack'' (uncommon nowadays), or as a separate source code distribution such as a public Git repository.

All variants to date have the same overall goal that vanilla ''NetHack'' does: to enter [[Gehennom]], retrieve the [[Amulet of Yendor]], and bring it to the [[Astral Plane]].

If you are thinking about making a variant, consider consulting active variant developers on [[Libera]] for advice and early feedback on your ideas.

==Actively developed variants==

These are variants that has added new features (not just bugfixes) in the last year.

| currver=3.21.4
| variantof=[[nethack.alt.org]] version of [[NetHack 3.4.3]]
}}
''dNetHack'' is a variant that does five main things: it greatly increases the number of artifacts, implements new monsters, re-organizes and expands the dungeon, attempts to re-balance armors, item appearances, and intrinsics to make more choices viable in the late game, and replaces the [[Elbereth]] mechanic with warding signs. It also incorporates the [[Pirate]] and [[Convict]] patches, and makes a few minor changes in existing classes and items. 

Most new artifacts have custom effects and/or invocations. Most new monsters have new attacks or other code support. Dungeon changes include: multi-level alignment “quest” branches, additional side branches off the main dungeon, and a shortened [[Gehennom]], with demon lairs randomly drawn from a small pool and fewer straight-up maze levels.

dNetHack incorporates code from many other variants and patches, such as [[SLASH'EM]], and implements many [[YANI]]s from this wiki and from [[rec.games.roguelike.nethack]].

Discuss the variant at [irc://libera.chat/dnethack irc://libera.chat/dnethack].
It is playable at [[hardfought]].

| link=[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack GitHub]
| currver=0.8.0
| variantof=[[NetHack 3.6.6]] post-release version
}}
''EvilHack'' is a variant based on [[NetHack 3.6.6|NetHack 3.6.6]].

EvilHack was designed from the outset to be a much more difficult game to win than vanilla ''NetHack''. The inspiration for this game mainly comes from the variants GruntHack and SporkHack, incorporating many of the same features that make those variants difficult in their own right. Some of those features have remained the same (for example, SporkHack's reflection changes), but many have been altered to set them apart and provide the player with a new experience. Elements from other variants have been included as well, such as from Slash'EM, SpliceHack, UnNetHack, and xNetHack. There is also a significant amount of custom content that has been developed that is not found in any other variant. More custom content will be added as development continues, mainly in the way of optional branch quests.

EvilHack features new races and roles, new items (including [[object materials]] and [[object properties]]), an improved monster AI, a revamped [[Gehennom]], several new monsters, and adds exciting and challenging experiences to virtually every aspect of vanilla ''NetHack''. It can be played on the [[Public server|Hardfought]] server.

| currver=4.3.1
}}
''FIQHack'' is a variant of [[NetHack 4]] that has 3 main focuses: improving convenience and quality of life, improving monster AI and behaviour, and improving monster/player symmetry (i.e. making things behave the same for both). Aside from this, there have also been various other gameplay tweaks, as well as improvement of code quality.

A comprehensive changelog of every notable change in FIQHack can be found in its [[FIQHack|article]].

| variantof=[[NetHack 3.6.2]]
}}

''GnollHack'' is a variant of ''NetHack'' 3.6.2 developed by Sound Mind Games, a Finnish nonprofit organization. It adds numerous monsters and items, changes spellcasting, and adds Gnolls as a playable race (replacing Gnomes). It has a forum [https://community.soundmindgames.com/forums/gnollhack.18/ here].

''notdNetHack'' is a dNetHack fork that seeks to add more depth to the existing content of dNetHack while balancing and trimming out some of its points of failure. notdNetHack attempts to add fully complete features and content that feel like they belong with the existing dNetHack base while not being afraid to be different.

It is playable on the [[em.slashem.me]] and [[hardfought.org]] servers.

| maintainer=[[User:Bluescreenofdeath|Bluescreenofdeath]] a.k.a. Amy or AmyBSOD
| currver=2.7.7
}}
''Slash'EM Extended'' is a variant of [[SLASH'EM]].

Compared to SLASH'EM, Slash'EM Extended contains many new roles and races for the player to choose from, many new special levels, a lot of new monsters, and other changes (similar goals to the original SLASH'EM, which also aimed at adding lots of stuff, so this has even more). The main [[dungeon]] is a bit shorter in Slash'EM Extended than in SLASH'EM but the Gehennom is longer (making their lengths more like in vanilla [[NetHack]]), and the demon/devil lairs appear in a random order.

| currver=1.2.0
| variantof=[[NetHack|NetHack 3.7.0]] development version
}}
''SpliceHack'' is a variant that was unintentionally released only a few hours before 3.6.1; it is now based on NetHack 3.7.0.

The main goal of SpliceHack is to make the game much more interesting and dynamic by adding additional content, while being as accessible as possible to those used to playing vanilla ''NetHack''. A secondary goal is to maintain a level of balance and difficulty that is similar to vanilla. The variant is updated frequently, and YANIs are actively incorporated into the code. The author has described it as what SLASH'EM might look like if SLASH'EM had been based on [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

SpliceHack features a large number of new monsters, items, locations, and effects. It also includes a number of extensible and dynamic features, such as monsters that are random fusions of other monsters and allowing pets to gain resistances through corpses. It can be played on the [[Hardfought]] server.

=== [[UnNetHack]] ===
{{VariantInfo

| currver=6.0.6
| variantof=[[NetHack 3.4.3]]
}}
''UnNetHack'' is a variant whose main intent is to put more randomness, challenges and fun into ''NetHack''. UnNetHack incorporates many changes from other variants and patches as well as its own to form a fun and balanced variant. In the era of [[NetHack 3.4.3]], it was described as “how ''NetHack'' would look today if the [[DevTeam]] didn't stop releasing”, but then the DevTeam [[NetHack 3.6.0|did keep releasing]], and brought in content from UnNetHack to boot. It is the most famous and popular of the actively developed variants, and frequently shares with and borrows from other variants.

Discuss the variant at [irc://libera.chat/unnethack irc://libera.chat/unnethack].

It features more levels, several UI improvements, and a lot of game play related changes. It can be played on the [[Public server|Hardfought]] server.

| link=[https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack Project GitHub]
| currver=7.1.0
| variantof=[[NetHack 3.7.0]] development version
}}
''xNetHack'' is the first variant to be based on [[NetHack 3.7.0]].

Its main goals are to fix balance problems in vanilla and remove sources of frustration, as well as experimenting with [[YANI]]s from the community. It also follows a unique development model of remaining up-to-date with the latest code added to vanilla, rather than being based on a static release; consequently, new features and improvements in vanilla always get included in xNetHack soon after they are added.

Some of its features include special rooms in maze levels, an overhauled spellcasting system, several new conducts, and several UI enhancements. It can be played on the [[Public server|Hardfought]] server.

==Maintained variants==

These variants haven't added any new features in the past year, but someone is still fixing bugs.

===[[DNHslex]]===
{{VariantInfo

| link=[https://github.com/AmyBSOD/dnhslex Project's GitHub page]
| currver=3.16.1
| variantof=[[dNetHack]]
}}
''DNHslex'' is a variant of [[dNetHack]] maintained by [[User:Bluescreenofdeath|AmyBSOD]]. It adds more variety by enabling all role, race, gender, and alignment combos for playing, allowing many more monsters and items to be randomly generated, and adding new monsters from other ''NetHack'' variants as well. Apart from a bunch of monster shoes from [[SLASH'EM]] it tries to remain true to the spirit of dNetHack.

It is playable on the [[em.slashem.me]] server.

| currver=0.3.0
| variantof=[[NetHack 3.4.3]]
}}
''GruntHack'' is a variant intended to extend and enhance the game's existing behavior rather than altering it in any thoroughly substantial way, such as [[object]]s of the same object type being made from different [[material]]s and occasionally possessing [[Object properties|non-standard powers]], [[monster]]s having [[Racial monster|different race]]s and using more tactics when fighting other monsters, and more intelligent pet behavior.

Though it enables the player to become significantly more powerful than in vanilla, a number of its changes add significant challenges to the early and late game, making it one of the most difficult variants.

''NetHack 4'' is a merge of [[AceHack]] and [[NitroHack]], and the official successor to both projects. It aims for gameplay similar to ''NetHack'' but with an improved interface. It combines the interface improvements and gameplay changes of AceHack (see its section) with the persistent inventory, larger message box, new status display, new options interface, fully remappable keys, new main menu and other features of NitroHack.

It can be played online on its [[public server]] using [telnet://nethack4.org/ telnet nethack4.org] or [ssh://nethack43@nethack4.org ssh nethack43@nethack4.org] (password "nethack43") or via [ssh://nethack@hardfought.org ssh nethack@hardfought.org] (USA).

''NetHack Fourk'' is an experimental fork of [[NetHack 4]]. It has four main types of changes: balance adjustments and formula tweaks; differentiation of similar monsters, objects, and levels; consolidation of boring things; and monster letter reorganization.  A lot of game mechanics work slightly differently than players tend to be used to. See [https://github.com/tsadok/nhfourk/blob/bleeding-edge/doc/changelog-fourk.txt the changelog] for details.

''Slash'EM'' or ''SLASH'EM'', officially ''SuperLotsaAddedStuffHack - Extended Magic'', used to be the foremost variant. This game and its ancestor variants are now part of vanilla ''NetHack''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[game history]], because of the reuse of certain SLASH'EM code in [[NetHack 3.3.0]].

SLASH'EM puts more effort into killing the [[hero]]; plenty of games end on dungeon level 1. There are more than plenty of new [[monster]]s, [[item]]s and [[magic]]. The dungeon features several new one-level dungeon branches for the hero to die in. Three new [[portal]]s lead to quests for [[Alignment key|artifact key]]s. The player also has a larger choice of [[race]]s and [[role]]s than in vanilla, and that alone is enough to make an experienced NetHack player rethink [[strategy]].

SLASH'EM started as a combination of two other variants, '''[[SLASH]]''' and the '''[[Wizard Patch]]'''. In turn, SLASH was a merger of and addition to '''[[NetHack Plus]]''' and '''[[NetHack--]]'''.

SLASH'EM recently switched from 'unmaintained' to 'maintained' status, with the advent of several recent commits that have addressed several bugs. The updated/maintained version can be played on the [[Public server|Hardfought]] server. An older, unmaintained version can be found at [[em.slashem.me]].

''SporkHack'' is a variant actively developed and tested until December 2011; development was started up again in July of 2017 by community members Tangles and K2. The stated purpose of the variant is to try to bring more challenge to the vanilla game for experienced players, as well as to make things less boring for ''all'' players. A patch and a Windows binary are available from the home page; the patch can be applied to a standard NetHack 3.4.3 distribution. SporkHack contains "more interesting" [[Caveman]] and [[Knight]] roles, and a number of balance adjustments throughout the game to spells, monsters and items... as well as intangibles such as the "to hit" formula. There are also cosmetic changes, for example the [[master lich]] is a [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/8766fa58e6b4caec/36ad820692d27fd2 green L].

The latest developed version (0.7.0) can be played online at the hardfought.org [[public server]] via [ssh://nethack@hardfought.org ssh nethack@hardfought.org] (discussion in [irc://libera.chat/#hardfought #hardfought] on [[Libera]]).

''AceHack'' is a variant of ''NetHack'' that has similar gameplay to NetHack 3.4.3 but an improved interface, e.g. walking into doors opens them automatically, background colors to distinguish [[tameness|tame]]/[[peaceful]]/[[hostile]] monsters and stairs under items, describing what's under the cursor while moving it in [[farlook]], and warning before moving into lava. It also includes gameplay changes such as rerolling for items and attributes during character generation, auto-identifying some items under circumstances where the identity is unambiguous, making [[floating eye]]s unhittable instead of [[paralysis|paralyzing]], replacing [[Stormbringer]]'s disabling of the peaceful attack warning prompt with [[aggravate monster]] when wielded, and replacing map and item identity [[scroll of amnesia|amnesia]] with draining of skill and spell training.

Coming from Japan, ''NetHack brass'' (developed by Kōcha Yōkan, which roughly translates to "tea-flavored [[gelatinous cube]]") is lesser known among ''NetHack'' players who do not speak Japanese. The game is in English but most of the community uses Japanese. NetHack brass adds no new races or roles, but it has a few new [[item]]s and a redesigned [[Gehennom]]. Its major features include the new #[[skills (NetHack brass)|skills]] system and tweaks to how heroes gain [[experience level]]s and [[attribute]]s. [[Minetown]] is now filled with shops, while the top of [[Sokoban]] offers prizes but permits the player to choose one and only one.

Despite the many changes in this variant, they do not feel so drastic, and NetHack brass feels more like [[vanilla]] than the other variants.

''NitroHack'' is a variant that aims to be a modern, network-capable fork of the classic game.

It features native netplay via its client (connect to ''nitrohack.org''), and can support any client that can speak its new JSON-based protocol; a web client is planned. It uses an enhanced version of the [[Curses interface]], has fully remappable key controls and character display, dungeon overview, and UI improvements from [[AceHack]]. It also records full play logs, allowing players to view interactive replays of current and finished games. Its savegame code is notoriously buggy, though.

Development of NitroHack has stopped in favor of [[NetHack 4]], itself a merge of AceHack and NitroHack. NitroHack also lives on in [[DynaHack]], another modern variant that is based on NitroHack. Both NetHack 4 and DynaHack thankfully fix the buggy savegame code of NitroHack.

''[[nethack.alt.org]]'', commonly abbreviated to NAO, is one of the oldest ''NetHack'' public servers, and by far the most popular. For many years, they maintained their own variant of ''NetHack'', based on [[NetHack 3.4.3]].  It is meant to provide identical gameplay to vanilla 3.4.3.  The changes they do include are bugfixes, interface improvements, removal of exploits, changes to allow tracking more statistics, a few popular patches, and minor miscellaneous improvements. It was long regarded as the best one to use if you wanted something as similar as possible to vanilla NetHack 3.4.3 but with the bugs fixed. However, it has largely been displaced by [[NetHack 3.6.1]], which incorporates all of the bugfixes and nearly all of the quality-of-life improvements.

After the release of 3.6.1, alt.org stopped hosting and updating it. It can still be played on [[hardfought.org]]. The source, for the time being, remains available at http://alt.org/nethack/naonh.php.

==Historically significant patches==
===[[Biodiversity patch]]===
The [http://web.archive.org/web/20041209022619/http://userfs.cec.wustl.edu/~naw1/nh/nh_bio.html biodiversity patch] by Nicholas Aodhagan Webb adds several monsters to the game, adjusts some monster behaviors and adds a few other features. This patch is about populating the [[dungeon]] with monsters, not about changing the dungeon. It even adds more [[tree]]s.

Some of the changes have a basis in [[real life|reality]] (like echolocation for [[bat]]s), but there are also some serious nasties, including the [[disintegrator]] and the [[goldbug]].

===[[Convict patch]]===
This patch adds the Convict, a [[role]] more difficult than the [[Tourist]]. A large number of variants include this patch.

===[[Lethe patch]]===
The [http://web.archive.org/web/20080208181124/http://e-wire.net.au/~eb_mykae/ Lethe patch] by Michael Clarke seems to be only a minor change to the game, before you reach [[Medusa]]. There you find the River Lethe which leads you into a very different [[Gehennom]].

There are many new scares down there. If you are sufficiently powerful, then you can fight through it all, but it will be far more difficult than the boring and relatively benign [[maze]]s of vanilla. Type carefully, and do not step into the river that causes [[amnesia]]. At [[Moloch's Sanctum]], the [[high priest]] of Moloch is [[Cthulhu]]...

These days, more players choose [[SLASH'EM]] 0.0.7E7, which has most of the new items and monsters from this patch, but not the changed levels. Until the levels are integrated, one can play '''[[SLethe]]''' which includes the new levels. There is a 0.0.7E7F3 SLethe playground on [[em.slashem.me]].

[[Category:Variants]]}
&&%s&& %s Linley's Dungeon Crawl {150175 2023-03-08T09:42:50Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} word choice '''''Linley's Dungeon Crawl''''' (often called ''Dungeon Crawl'' or simply ''Crawl'') is a [[roguelike]] game in a fantasy setting. Though ''NetHack'' has inspired many features of ''Crawl'', the two games are very different.

==Origin==
The creator, Linley Henzell, made slight changes to the [[NetHack General Public License]] to create the "Crawl General Public License", thus ''Crawl'' is [[free]] software. Crawl does not contain any source code from NetHack.

Henzell created ''Crawl'' in 1995 and continued to improve the game until 1999. After that, he allowed a group of contributors to develop new versions of Crawl. Development stalled in 2003 with the release of Crawl 4.0.0 beta 26. The last developer, Brent Ross, proceeded to produce versions of Crawl 4.1 alpha until 2005.

A variant called ''Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup'' has displaced the original game (somewhat analogous to how ''NetHack'' displaced ''[[Hack]]''). This variant integrates various bug fixes, interface improvements, statistical tweaks, and new dungeon branches. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is also [[free]], under the GNU GPL V2 license. Most Crawl players now play Stone Soup.

==Differences in development==
The development of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is quite open; the developers use a Git repository that provides public read access, they chat on a public mailing list, and they seek new contributors. Much play of DCSS is on public servers, and the most recent development version is normally available.

NetHack's [[DevTeam]] has recently also moved to having an open version control repository.

==Comparisons==
Crawl and NetHack seem very similar in some ways. ''Note: as Stone Soup has gone through over 15 years of active development, differences will be noted in itallics.''

* The goal in both games is to retrieve a special thing from the dungeon. NetHack players seek the [[Amulet of Yendor]], while Crawl players want the Orb of Zot. To open the way to the special thing, the player must perform the [[invocation ritual]] in NetHack or must collect runes of Zot in Crawl. Then one must return upward, carrying the special thing out of the dungeon.
* Crawl and NetHack both use persistent levels, although Crawl has two significant areas with non-persistent levels (the Abyss and Pandemonium). [[You]] may take stairs to revisit levels, and strategic use will help the survival of the player.
* Crawl and NetHack both feature a similar fantasy settings. Expect to find elves, dwarves, orcs, kobolds and such in both games. Both games have magic items like [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s.
* Crawl and NetHack both allow you to attack monsters with melee attacks (by walking into them), ranged attacks (by shooting or throwing something at them), or magic (by zapping something at them).
* Crawl and NetHack both have [[trap]]s. Step on the wrong square, and it might [[teleport]] you or worse, for example.
* Crawl and NetHack players may [[starvation|starve]] to death unless they eat corpses. ''*Food has been removed in modern Stone Soup.''
* Crawl and NetHack both have [[bones]] levels, although they are sharply different in nature: NetHack bones save the entire level, including monsters and items, and a weak ghost, while Crawl bones do not save the level layout, monsters, or items, but contain a player ghost that has powers similar to the deceased character. ''*While recent Stone Soup versions have locked ghosts behind a closed door due to trolling, prior versions let ghosts roam free.''
* Crawl and NetHack both have various [[dungeon branch]]es.

==Differences in gameplay==
Players who try both games will immediately notice these obvious differences about the dungeon.
* Crawl does not start you with a pet!  In fact, allies (as they are called in Crawl) are extremely rare to find, although summoning spells (which create temporary allies) can potentially fill that gap.
* Crawl generates larger dungeon levels than NetHack. In Crawl, the <tt>@</tt> remains in the center of the map while the dungeon scrolls around the adventurer.
* While NetHack starts out with distinct, separate rectangular [[room]]s connected with [[corridor]]s, Crawl starts out with more complex level designs, such as adjacent rooms, parallel corridors, pillars, and multiple staircases to the same level.

Crawl characters have better vision, too. If you give enough attention to the first dungeon branch in both games, you will notice the difference between NetHack's dark corridors and Crawl's lit corridors. If you play Stone Soup, your characters will see very well around corners, because of the [http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Permissive_Field_of_View Permissive Field of View]. Vision in Stone Soup is symmetric, so if you can see the monster then the monster can see you. But Crawl limits the radius of vision; a Crawl player may be unable to see monsters on the other side of a large room, but NetHack players always see as far as possible in lit areas.

However, Crawl has subtle differences from NetHack that seriously affect how one plays the game. This presentation of the differences may be overly general, not to apply in all situations, so beware.
* '''Skills are much more important than class in Crawl.''' Instead of 4 (or 6) granular levels of training, Crawl has numerical skills, up to level 27. Barring a few racial gimmicks (the cat species, Felid, can't use weapons/armour), every character can learn every skill to its maximum. Your class only defines what skills, stats, and items you start with. Your race defines how fast you learn skills, as well as certain gimmicks.  However, the direction you then go is entirely up to you.  <br>You could start as a melee-focused Hill Orc Fighter, learn spellcasting from scrolls, read a spellbook, and spend the rest of the game as a spellcaster. (''Stone Soup allows you to train any skill at any time - no need for scrolls.''). However, fighting monsters without enough skill is even more perilous; think getting hit 16 times from a hydra from one slow swing.
* '''Gods are both more numerous and unique.''' Instead of 3 alignments, and deities varying only in name, Crawl features 12 (''26 in Stone Soup'') gods. A large majority of them are not assigned at the start, instead picked in the very early dungeon (requiring that you find the god's altar to do so). Though most lack any noticeable conduct, gods define your character. Each one has multiple unique abilities and/or passive buffs.
* '''The identification game is dramatically streamlined.''' Crawl players are much more likely to blindly consume items, especially scrolls, in order to ID them. It's often the only way to identify, ''and all consumables in Stone Soup are identified on use even if they did nothing''. There are few, if any, special 'tricks' like [[price identification]]. The only other reliable method of identify is the scroll, which requires blind use to find. Players do this because '''there are few incredibly nasty bad items in Crawl.''' There's nothing like the [[scroll of amnesia]] (although an item by such a name with a good effect exists!) or the possibility of a confused self-[[genocide]].  ''[[Curse]]s have been removed, and their only effect was to be stuck to the player. Now, armor, weapons, jewellery, and wands are completely auto-identified when you step on their tile.''
* '''Crawl encourages the player to advance downward quickly''', while NetHack players may linger on upper levels. Once a level is cleared, there is little reason to remain there.  NetHack players like to linger to regenerate or to sacrifice at an [[altar]], and may encounter several battles even when traveling up through the dungeon. Of course, players of both games will travel up to escape monsters or to visit their [[stash]]es. ''* Stone Soup has disabled random monster generation, and older versions would spawn extremely out of depth monsters if you stayed too long.''
* '''NetHack restricts shooting to eight directions.''' It is a tradition that will not disappear; it enhances [[strategy]] greatly by allowing monsters (especially those annoying [[unicorn]]s) to be out of your line of fire. Crawl has a targeting system that allows you to shoot arbitrarily nearby targets within your field of view, plus all of the extra controls that such a system requires. Stone Soup's symmetric vision allows you and monsters to trade shots around corners. Instead, many of Crawl's spells have unique targeting mechanics: Fireball creates a 3&times;3 explosion, ''Frozen Ramparts freezes enemies adjacent to walls, and Starburst fires in all 8 cardinal directions (whenever you like it or not)''. Ranged options have a comparably shorter range as a result.
* '''NetHack has containers.''' NetHack players like to use [[chest]]s, while Crawl players drop items on the ground. As a more-than-compensation, Crawl features an elaborate "stash" system which tracks the location of all objects ever seen, easily accessible with a CTRL-F. ''*In DCSS, items can never be damaged, and once-seen items are never picked up by monsters. Various item removals and the removal of all weight make things even easier.'' 
* '''NetHack seems to give more emphasis to arbitrary uses for objects than Crawl.''' In Stone Soup, there is explicitly only one mechanical use per item, and even in Linley's Crawl there weren't that many. You drink [[Potion#Thrown potions|potions]], but can't throw them at enemies. You can zap wands, but are unable to [[engrave]] or [[Wand#Breaking_wands|break]] them.
* '''Characters and monsters in Crawl are much more vulnerable.''' A well armored Minotaur Fighter can lose half their health by a single hit from a fairly measly ogre, and all living lategame characters have to deal with Torment, which directly cuts HP by half. The only way to get intrinsic resistances is the rare and risky mutation system, with characters relying on items instead. In exchange, '''Instant deaths are almost nonexistent''': there is no [[touch of death]] or "the poison was deadly...". So there is nothing absolutely required like NetHack's [[reflection]]; while useful, intrinsics like magic resistance and poison resistance can be forgone. Which may be a necessity, given that guaranteed items are few and [[wish]]ing does not exist.
* '''Magic is generally much more powerful and accessible.''' Any character can learn (almost) every skill, and skills are the most important part of casting. Spellbooks come with multiple spells, there are more spells in general, and players will not forget them over time. Even low-level spells can provide useful or potentially life-saving effects.  On the other end of the spectrum, high-level magic is by far the most damaging thing in the game, dealing over 7-8x what an endgame melee weapon will do.  In turn, most high-level player deaths will be from magic, not melee.
All these elements combine into one final difference, a summary point that applies mostly to Stone Soup:
* '''Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a game streamlined for combat'''. NetHack focuses a lot of the out of combat, 'dungeoneering' experience. An adventurer's [[bag of holding]] might hold many miscellaneous tools (musical instruments, magic markers, spare unicorn horn, water-walking boots, junk scrolls to blank later, junk potions to dilute later, huge piles of food, collection of valuable gems) to exploit. Stone Soup calls that clutter.

: There is strikingly little non-combat interaction: while strategic character-building has been maintained, identification has been stripped of complexity, inventory management has continuously been streamlined, and 'creative' spoilery functions mostly do not exist. They fit in well with NetHack's geeky tone and reference-based humor. But once a player knows how to dip for [[Excalibur]], Crawl's DevTeam could cut the process out and give it randomly to the player, which reduces 'noob trap' potential. Instead of flavor, Stone Soup's focus lies in adding replayability and tense, combat-focused scenarios.

: This mentality ultimately comes from the fact that DCSS is a much, much younger game: forked from Linley's Crawl roughly 20 years post-NetHack, and actively developed for over 15 years afterwards - in an era where 'spoilers' are commonly used, acceptable, and available. Even the game itself features a much more robust database than NetHack.

==Differences in interface and documentation==
Crawl's tty user interface is better than that of NetHack. NetHack's problem is its old [[source code]] and its desire to remain compatible with old Hack and NetHack versions. The default values of some [[options]] follow this desire. So <tt>[[color]]</tt> defaults to false, and <tt>[[msg_window]]</tt> defaults to 's' single rather than 'f' full, because older versions had no color and displayed only single previous messages. (At least <tt>[[menustyle]]</tt> defaults to 'f' full instead of 't' traditional. Traditional menus are that primitive type being familiar to [[Hack]] players.)

An 80x24 window is large enough to show the entire map of a NetHack level, which assists player awareness.

Crawl's manual is better organised than the NetHack [[Guidebook]]. Crawl's manual, a text file, keeps the less important material in appendixes, and shuns long alphabetic lists by presenting things in groups. A separate text file describes the options. Meanwhile, NetHack's Guidebook uses [[troff]] or [[TeX]] formatting, so that the [[DevTeam]] may create pretty PostScript and HTML versions of the Guidebook, not only plain text files.

==Generation==
Wands constitute 4% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 6% in containers, 5% on the Rogue level, and 8% in [[Gehennom]]. There is a 4.5% chance that a randomly-generated wand will be a wand of polymorph.

Monsters can be generated with this wand as a [[miscellaneous item]] if their [[difficulty]] is 5 or less.

== Effects ==
[[Zap]]ping the wand in a direction will polymorph any monsters or items in its path; zapping the wand at yourself will polymorph you, ignoring [[magic resistance]]. Monsters can zap this wand at themselves, but mercifully, this will not generate out-of-depth monsters.{{reffunc|muse.c|muse_newcham_mon}}

[[Breaking wands|Breaking]] a wand of polymorph causes an explosion that deals 1 to (4&times;<charges>) damage and polymorphs monsters and items on affected squares; this ignores magic resistance for the player.

Wands of polymorph are immune to polymorphing from other sources, such as a [[potion of polymorph]].

==Strategy==
{{Main|Polymorph}}
The advantage of using a wand of polymorph over other methods is that you do not need to use up a potion or be able to cast the {{spell of|polymorph}} spell; [[charging]] can also be used to extend the wand's lifespan. Wands are commonly used for [[polypiling]] and trying to polymorph your [[pet]] into something high-level; however, the latter carries the risk of [[system shock]], unlike a [[polymorph trap]].

Polymorphing hostile monsters is generally a last-ditch attempt, as it can create even more dangerous out-of-level monster types, but it may be useful in specific situations, such as killing [[shopkeepers]] and fighting [[minotaur]]s.

With [[polymorph control]], you can zap the wand and choose what monster to become; see [[Polymorph#Self-polymorph|the section on polyself]] for details. If you have polymorph control or [[unchanging]] and are surrounded by hordes of nasty monsters, breaking this wand may be a fairly effective last resort to get out of such a jam, but it is entirely dependent on if the new forms are easier to deal with. You can also use this technique to polymorph hordes of pets into stronger ones, though be warned that you ''do'' not want to attempt this with pets that are too weak to survive the blast to begin with (such as jackals); a mass pet die-off can leave you with ''very'' low alignment.

{{wand

  |spell=knock
}}

A '''wand of opening''' can be used to unlock [[door]]s and [[container]]s, escape [[engulfing]] monsters, and remove [[punishment]].  The effect is identical to that of the spell {{spell of|knock}}.

==Effect (wand of opening and knock)==
Except where noted, a wand of opening will be identified if it had any effect and you can observe the effect (e.g., you can see the affected object).

===On monsters===
* Monster regurgitates the player if [[engulf|engulfed]].{{refsrc|zap.c|239}}
* Removes monster's saddle, if worn, dropping it on the monster's square{{refsrc|zap.c|246}} (including your steed's saddle if you zap downward while riding<ref>{{function|zap.c|zap_steed}}</ref>).

Regardless, if the zap strikes any monster, the monster does not necessarily get an immediate chance to attack the player, as it would with most spell strikes.{{refsrc|zap.c|238}}  This will ''not'' identify a wand of opening.

===On movable objects===
* Striking a [[punishment|punished]] player's chain (but not the ball) will unpunish you.{{refsrc|zap.c|1491}}
* Unlocks [[large box]]es and [[chest]]s ("Klick!") and fixes the lock if broken.<ref>[[Zap.c#line1589]], [[Lock.c#boxlock]]</ref>

Either of these effects will identify a wand of opening, even if the affected object cannot be seen.{{refsrc|zap.c|1593}}

===On you===
If you are [[punishment|punished]], you will receive the message "Your chain quivers for a moment.", and the wand will be identified.{{refsrc|zap.c|2100}}

===On immovable objects===
* Reveals and unlocks hidden doors ("A door appears in the wall!"), and unlocks non-hidden doors ("The door unlocks!").  The door remains closed.<ref>{{function|Lock.c|doorlock}}</ref>
* Interrupts attempts to break down a door with a [[pickaxe]] or [[mattock]], and repairs the door.<ref>{{function|Lock.c|doorlock}}</ref>
* If you zap up or down while on a closed [[portcullis]] (possible with [[phasing]]), it will open.{{refsrc|zap.c|2316}}
* If you zap down while on the [[quest level]]'s down stairs before your leader permits you to go on the quest, you will receive the message "The stairs seem to ripple momentarily."{{refsrc|zap.c|2320}} and the wand will be identified.
* Opens [[drawbridge]]s.{{refsrc|zap.c|2678}}
* Triggers [[trapdoor]]s and [[falling rock trap]]s{{reffunc|trap.c|openfallingtrap}} (only if someone stands on the trap).
* Releases you or a monster from a [[bear trap]] or a [[web]].{{reffunc|trap.c|openholdingtrap}}  The monster may be pacified if adjacent.

A '''wand of locking''' will close and lock [[chest]]s and [[door]]s. If the door or the lock is broken, it will be repaired. If the doorway has no door at all, a door will be created. (If there is something in the doorway, the spell will not work.) [[Drawbridge]]s will be closed. 

The effects of a wand of locking are the same as those of the spellbook of wizard lock; see further information at [[wizard lock]].

&&%s&& %s Wand of probing {129712 2019-12-15T01:18:37Z {4000978 Aximili} Add more explicit sections {{wand
  |name=probing
  |cost=150
  |type=beam
  |maxcharges=8
  |abundance=3%
}}

A '''wand of probing''' can give you information about a [[monster]], or the contents of a [[container]]. When zapped, it will probe all targets in the path of its [[beam]]. It also has other uses.

== Effects ==

In general, wands of probing act much like [[stethoscope]]s. Zapping one prompts the player for a direction, and if there is a suitable target, shows the name, alignment, level, HP, AC, and status of the target. Like a stethoscope, it does not anger peaceful targets. Unlike a [[stethoscope]], it is a directional beam, allowing the remote assessment of the target, and it will also show the inventory of the target.

== Strategy ==

The wand has some situational usages, such as:

* Checking the inventory of your [[pet]] when supplying it with equipment.
* Determining if you are at the correct [[Astral Plane]] [[temple]] by probing the [[high priest]].
* Checking the inventory of [[peaceful]] monsters for useful items before taking an alignment penalty for killing them, e.g. dwarves with mithril, or temple priests with books.
* Checking the inventory of [[Shopkeeper|monsters with predefined magic items]] (shopkeepers, soldiers) to identify those items.
* Checking a [[bag of holding]] in a [[bones]] pile to decide if you would benefit from [[uncursing]] it right away.
* Checking [[statue|historical statues]] for useful items before taking an [[alignment]] penalty for breaking into them as an [[Archeologist]].
* Checking for [[Pit#Burying_objects|buried objects]] when zapped downwards, for example while on top of a [[headstone|grave]].{{refsrc|zap.c|2309|comment=Behavior of wand of probing zapped downwards.}}
* To locate and identify an invisible creature [[warning|causing you distress]].
* To identify which creature is wearing the amulet of [[amulet of life saving|life saving]] or [[amulet of reflection|reflection]] you [[Spellbook of detect treasure|know]] is on the level, so that you may charm and perhaps polymorph it into a powerful [[pet]] instead of merely killing it (twice).
* [[speed ascension|Game-time speed runners]] need to write many [[scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]] to replenish their power. [[Air elemental]] is the fastest polyself form, e.g. to find the [[vibrating square]]. But it is blind. Probing oneself makes a freshly written scroll [[Blindness#Object_appearances|"seen"]] and useable.
* In principle, [[zen]] players could make objects seen. However, identifying it is hard.

Otherwise a wand of probing is inferior to a stethoscope, being heavier, slower, and having only limited charges. This makes it a good candidate for [[polypiling]].

&&%s&& %s Wand of magic missile {150315 2023-03-24T10:48:54Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Strategy */* {{wand
  |name=magic missile
  |cost=150
  |type=ray
  |maxcharges=8
  |abundance=5%
  |spell=magic missile
  |muse=off
}}

The  '''wand of magic missile''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
A [[Wizard]] may receive a wand of magic missile as part of their starting inventory.

There is a 5% chance that a [[Wand#Generation|randomly-generated wand]] within the dungeon and its branches will be a wand of magic missile. Monsters may generate with the wand as a random [[offensive item]].

[[Shopkeeper]]s have a {{frac|4}} chance of being generated with a wand of magic missile.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|678|version=NetHack 3.6.7}}

==Description==
[[Zap]]ping the wand in a given direction will fire a [[ray]] of magic missiles that damages monsters in its path - unlike the [[spell of magic missile]], the wand only deals 2d6 damage and does not scale with the user's level. The ray can rebound off walls and monsters with [[reflection]]. [[Magic resistance]] negates this damage, as does reflection.

[[Engraving]] with a wand of magic missile will give a unique [[#Message|message]], but does not [[auto-identify]] the wand.{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|712|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=the case for WAN_MAGIC_MISSILE does not set doknown|name=doknown}}

==Strategy==
Wands of magic missile are the least effective [[attack wand]], dealing only 2d6 damage and lacking useful secondary effects - they are best used liberally in the early game as a form of disposable [[ranged attack]] as it will soon be almost worthless. The wand's damage can be increased to a somewhat respectable 4d6 by bouncing the ray off a wall behind your target.

It is possible to use a wand of magic missile to engrave in the dust while [[levitation|levitating]]. If you're already levitating and want to engrave [[Elbereth]], you can use this to save a charge from a more useful [[wand of digging]], [[wand of fire|fire]] or [[wand of lightning|lightning]], since engravings will not erode while you are levitating.

Arguably the best use of a wand of magic missile in the late game is to [[throw]] it at an intelligent monster. They may elect to pick it up and use it over any more deadly innate attacks or ranged weaponry that they possess, and most late-game players will have [[reflection]], rendering it harmless while damaging the zapping monster along with other monsters in the ray's path that are not resistant.

==History==
The wand of magic missile has been present in the game since Hack 1.21, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

==Origin==
The canonical [[D&D]] spell of ''[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicMissile.htm Magic Missile]'' was a stereotypically puny level one wizard spell that quickly became a staple of the wizard class, as it was effectively a homing attack with each bullet doing its own damage roll; this can easily rack up significant damage, short of the target having magic resistance. The magic missiles of ''NetHack'' lack this homing property.

In [[Rogue (game)|Rogue]], a wand of magic missile did ''1d4+1'' damage unless a given monster saves vs. magic ("The missile vanishes in a puff of smoke");<ref>http://rogue.rogueforge.net/vade-mecum/#glossary</ref>; this is a rough translation of the spell into the world of Rogue. In [[Hack]], it would always have the appearance of an aluminum wand and dealt ''2d6'' damage;<ref>[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/games/hack/uni87a/part1. Hack 1.02 Files Part 1]</ref><ref>[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/games/hack/uni87a/part9. Hack 1.02 Files Part 9]</ref> the latter trait was carried over into ''NetHack''.

==Messages==
{{message|The floor is riddled by bullet holes!|You engraved on the floor with a wand of magic missile.<ref name="doknown"/>}}

==Variants==
In several variants, engraving with a wand of magic missile will auto-identify it.

&&%s&& %s Wand of sleep {136621 2020-12-21T10:07:40Z {4001094 Luxidream} read off breaking wands part of the code, oops {{wand
  |name=sleep

  |type=ray
  |maxcharges=8
  |abundance=5%
  |spell=sleep
  |muse=off
}}

The '''wand of sleep''' is a [[wand]] in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Effect==
When zapped, it emits a [[ray]] that puts monsters it hits to [[sleep]] for 6d25 turns, unless they resist. Bolts of sleep can bounce from walls and unrevealed secret doors, but are absorbed by non-secret or discovered secret doors.

==Strategy==
You can use it to help defeat (or escape) a difficult [[monster]](s) unless they have [[sleep resistance]]; just be careful where the beam bounces. In a co-aligned [[temple]], you can use this wand to park a heavy monster on the [[altar]] so that you can kill it there without having it run away from you.

When engraving, this wand gives the same message as a [[wand of death]]. If the wand was not generated in a monster's inventory, the odds are 6:1 for it being sleep.

}}

The '''amethyst stone''' is a type of [[gem]] which is soft and always violet in appearance. Its base cost is 600 [[zorkmid]]s.

==Generation==
In addition to random generation and [[monster starting inventory]], every version of [[Mines' End]] contains an amethyst.

==Effects==
Dipping an amethyst in a [[potion of booze]] will turn it into a [[potion of fruit juice]].

==Strategy==
Amethysts are a unique and useful means to identify both the potions of booze and fruit juice as well as the gem, since no other gem transforms a potion by being dipped into it. Identifying fruit juice will also distinguish it from the [[potion of see invisible]], which has the same messages when [[quaff]]ed.

==Variants==
In [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNetHack]], amethyst stones can be used in [[Alchemy#Gem alchemy|gem alchemy]]; dipping one into a [[potion of acid]] produces a magenta potion.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Amethyst}}
The amethyst is a real-life gemstone; the ancient Greeks believed that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness. Its name comes from the Greek ἀ ''a-'' (“not”) and μέθυστος ''methustos'' (“drunk”), which is why it transforms booze into fruit juice in ''NetHack''.
