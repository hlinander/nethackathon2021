&&%s&& %s Branch {145405 2022-04-09T05:54:46Z {4001483 Cathartes} mention alignment bias of branches In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''branches''' are paths you can take within the [[Mazes of Menace]] that will lead you to various useful (and often optional) rewards. They are not to be confused with [[special level]]s, though most branches contain them &nbsp; the [[Big Room]] is a special level, but it is not a branch in the dungeon.  The [[monster frequency]] of randomly-generated monsters in dungeon branches may be biased toward specific [[alignment]]s.

Below is a list of dungeon branches:

* The [[Dungeons of Doom]], which contains the following dead-end branches:
** The [[Gnomish Mines]], which is eight or nine levels deep and biased toward lawful alignment.
** [[Sokoban]], which is always four levels high and biased toward neutral alignment.
** The [[Quest]], which is 5-7 levels deep and contains your role's [[quest artifact]] as well as the [[Bell of Opening]].
** [[Fort Ludios]], which may be accessible through a [[magic portal]] found in a [[vault]].
* [[Gehennom]], which contains the following dead-end branch:
**[[Vlad's Tower]], which is always 3 levels high, contains the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]], and is biased toward chaotic alignment.
* The [[Endgame]], consisting of the four [[Elemental Planes]] and the [[Astral Plane]].

The [[Wizard's Tower]] is not considered a dungeon branch, though it behaves similar to one for purposes of level teleportation.

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
[[UnNetHack]] makes some changes to existing branches and adds several new ones to the dungeon - see [[UnNetHack#Branch changes|UnNetHack § Branch changes]] for full details.

&&%s&& %s Throne room {146859 2022-07-21T12:32:44Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  A '''throne room''' is a type of [[special room]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]'', and contains an assortment of [[monster]]s, a [[throne]], and a [[chest]].

==Generation==
A throne room is generated with a {{frac|6}} chance in ordinary rooms-and-corridors levels from level 5 onwards, provided the level does not already have a [[shop]].{{refsrc|src/mklev.c|763|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} The monsters are always generated hostile and [[asleep]].{{refsrc|src/mkroom.c|348|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

The list of [[throne room monster]]s is as follows:{{refsrc|src/mkroom.c|738|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}
* [[dragon]]s (on level 15+)
* [[giant]]s (13+)
* [[troll]]s (10+)
* [[centaur]]s (6+)
* [[orc (monster class)|orc]]s
* [[bugbear]]s
* [[hobgoblin]]s
* [[gnome]]s
* [[kobold]]s

Deeper levels are skewed to harder monsters. The limits for ordinary random monsters (based on the average of your and the dungeon floor's level) do not apply. Extinct or genocided monsters will be replaced with ordinary random monsters. 

Additionally, the throne may have one of the following monsters sitting on it:

* [[Ogre king]]
* [[Elvenking]]
* [[Dwarf king]]
* [[Gnome king]]

The monster will have a [[mace]] in its inventory. Deeper levels will have higher level monsters sitting on the throne.{{refsrc|src/mkroom.c|247|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

===Special levels with throne rooms===
There is a guaranteed throne room in [[Fort Ludios]] (if the Fort is generated at all), with [[Croesus]] situated on the throne.

While there are also guaranteed thrones in the [[Castle]] and in [[Vlad's Tower]], the rooms they are located in are not considered throne rooms.

==Strategy==
Fighting all the monsters when they are awake can be dangerous for low-level characters, as most of the monsters can generate with [[wand]]s to use against you. Additionally, it is possible for early throne rooms with an otherwise-out of depth monster on the throne to generate - beware the Elvenking who rules over the sixth level!

If you have [[stealth]], you can carefully pick off the denizens of a throne room one by one&mdash;most throne room monsters are slower than an unhasted player, making them vulnerable to hit-and-run, ranged attacks and/or funneling them into outside hallways. Centaurs are the fastest throne room monsters that can generate, and pose the biggest obstace to the above strategies&mdash;they often generate with ranged weapons of their own, and may hit you several times per turn in [[melee]].

If luring throne room monsters into a hallway to fight, beware of monsters zapping a [[wand of digging]] down and leaving a hole between you and the throne room.

==History==
Throne rooms first appear in [[NetHack 1.3d]]; from this version to [[NetHack 3.6.0]], "royal" monsters could generate randomly in throne rooms, but they were not specifically placed on the throne (with the exception of Croesus) or given a mace until [[NetHack 3.6.1]];<ref>NetHack 3.6.1 commits: {{commit|4d7d63814a99b14acf0bcc96ddf567e966064b78|Throne room's throne is occupied by a king}}</ref> this addition is based on a patch by [[L (person)|Leon Arnott]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180902003105/http://l.j-factor.com/nethack/mkroom.diff Zoos and Courts patch] on an archive of L's website</ref>

{{message|You hear Queen Beruthiel's cats!|As above while [[hallucinating]].}}
{{message|You enter an opulent throne room!|You entered an occupied throne room.}}

==Variants==
Many 3.4.3-derived variants place a "royal" monster on the throne, and some of them additionally provide them with an enchanted mace or similar weapon.

===dNetHack===
In dNetHack, throne room monsters are often (75%) themed after a specific ruler. Rulers are chosen according to their [[difficulty]]: a chosen ruler will not have a difficulty greater than the average of your level and the dungeon level difficulty + 5, and will not be lower than {{frac|2|3}} of the dungeon level difficulty. If no prospective ruler fits these criteria, dNetHack will fall back on the standard set of throne room monsters.

The ruler types and corresponding monsters for each room are as follows, roughly sorted in order of difficulty:

* [[Kobold lord]] (difficulty 3): [[Kobold shaman]], [[large kobold]], [[kobold]], [[lemure]], [[imp]].
* [[Gnome king]] or gnome queen (difficulty 6): [[Gnome lord]], [[gnome lord|gnome lady]], [[gnome]], [[gnomish wizard]], [[tinker gnome]], [[dwarf]], [[dwarf lord]], [[dwarf cleric]], [[hobbit]], [[leprechaun]], [[homunculus]].
* [[Orc captain]] (difficulty 7): [[Orc shaman]], [[mordor orc]], [[hill orc]], [[hobgoblin]], [[goblin]], [[manes]], [[quasit]].
* [[Dwarf king]] or [[dwarf queen]] (difficulty 8): [[Dwarf lord]], [[dwarf cleric]], [[dwarf]], [[gnome]], [[gnome lord]], [[gnome lord|gnome lady]], [[gnomish wizard]], [[hobbit]], [[leprechaun]].
* [[Ogre king]] (difficulty 11): [[Ogre mage]], [[ogre lord]], [[ogre]], [[orc captain]], [[mordor orc]], [[tengu]], [[troll]], random [[H]].
* [[Elvenking]] or Elvenqueen (difficulty 14): [[Elf lord]], elf lady, [[Grey-elf]], [[Green-elf]], [[Woodland-elf]], [[quickling]], [[dryad]], [[naiad]], [[Eladrin#Coure Eladrin|Coure Eladrin]], [[Eladrin#Noviere Eladrin|Noviere Eladrin]], [[Eladrin#Bralani Eladrin|Bralani Eladrin]], [[Eladrin#Firre Eladrin|Firre Eladrin]], [[Eladrin#Shiere Eladrin|Shiere Eladrin]], [[doppelganger]], [[wood troll]].
* [[Vampire lord]] (difficulty 14): [[Vampire]], random [[Z]], random [[M]], [[flesh golem]], [[werewolf]], [[floating eye]], [[gargoyle]], [[winged gargoyle]], [[quasit]], [[black pudding]], [[wraith]], [[phantasm]], [[ghost]], [[maid]], [[weeping willow]], [[swamp nymph]].
* [[Drow matron]] (difficulty 15): [[Unearthly drow]], [[hedrow wizard]], [[hedrow warrior]], [[drow]], [[sprow]], [[swamp nymph]], [[giant spider]], [[cave lizard]], [[large cave lizard]], [[quasit]].
* [[Titan]] (difficulty 20): [[Storm giant]], [[fire giant]], [[frost giant]], [[hill giant]], [[stone giant]], [[giant]], [[son of Typhon]], [[dryad]], [[naiad]], [[oread]], [[deminymph]].
* [[Embraced drowess]] (difficulty 27): [[Drow alienist]], [[hedrow blademaster]], [[edderkop]], [[hedrow wizard]], [[hedrow warrior]], [[drow mummy]].
* [[Deepest one]] (difficulty 33): [[Deeper one]], [[deep one]], [[human]], [[mind flayer]], [[dark young]], [[umber hulk]], [[stumbling horror|stumbling]], [[wandering horror|wandering]], and [[shambling horror (dNetHack)|shambling horror]]s.
* [[Orc of the ages of stars]] (difficulty 37): [[Deep wyrm]], [[red dragon]], [[white dragon]], [[black dragon]], [[blue dragon]], [[angband orc]], [[hedrow blademaster]], [[succubus]], [[incubus]], [[olog-hai]], [[siege ogre]], [[hell hound]].

===GruntHack===
From its first version onward, [[GruntHack]] always generates a [[racial monster|monster royal]] on the throne of a throne room; this implementation is much different from the L patch that was eventually merged into vanilla.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], a "royal" monster always occupies the throne of a throne room, and is always given an [[ornate mace]].

==Strategy==
You can easily guess the presence of hidden doors in swamps, because of the absence of water pools near the door.

Very small swamp rooms can generate just one water pool, easily mistaken for a [[fountain]], so be careful.

The risks of [[drowning]] yourself or [[wet]]ting your inventory make swamps unappealing to traverse. Additionally, unlike other special rooms, swamps don't have much interesting loot. If you need to frequently pass through a level with swamps, and no swamp-free path exists between the upstair and downstair, consider [[dig]]ging your own.

A '''falling rock trap''' is a type of [[trap]] that appears in ''[[Nethack]]''.

==Generation==
If a [[trap door]] would be randomly generated on a level with a non-diggable floor, it is replaced with a falling rock trap.

==Description==
When triggered, the falling rock trap will either drop a [[rock]] that hits whoever triggered it on the head for 2d6 damage and lands on the ground, or disappears with a {{frac|15}} chance; if the victim is wearing a [[metallic]] [[helm]], the damage is reduced to 2.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|1020|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on player}}{{refsrc|src/trap.c|2246|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on monsters}}

==Removal==
One way to remove a falling rock trap is to trigger it repeatedly until it runs out of rocks.

==Strategy==
Early [[pet]] deaths are often due to this type of trap, earning it the nicknames "Puppy Pounder" and "Kitty Killer". The falling rock trap can be used as a source of rocks for cheap ammunition.

One of the early game weaknesses of an [[elven leather helm]] is the fact that it does not protect against damage from falling rock traps.

==History==
The falling rock trap was added in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

&&%s&& %s Wall {138305 2021-03-06T06:12:13Z {4001463 Actual-nh} Link xorn {{features}}
The '''wall''' is a [[square|terrain type]] represented mainly by {{lightgray|-}} and {{lightgray|&#x7c;}}, or {{lightgray|&nbsp;}}.

The solid black {{lightgray|&nbsp;}} generally represents [[solid rock|solid, unfinished rock]], and the other glyphs some kind of "finished" walls.

There are a few ways to pass through walls.

*You can [[dig]] through most walls.
*You can [[phasing|pass through]] walls if you are [[polymorph]]ed into a [[monster]] that can do so.
*A [[tunneling monster]] will randomly dig through walls, clearing a path for you.

Sometimes items randomly generated [[zorkmid|gold]] and [[gem]]s are embedded in [[solid rock]] walls. This random loot will never be generated in finished walls. If a monster, such as a [[xorn]], is killed while phasing through a wall, any objects it is carrying will become embedded in the wall.

If you don't have any means of digging, [[kick]]ing the wall will sometimes make the item fall loose, allowing you to pick it up.  You can also zap the objects with a [[wand of teleportation]] to move them to random locations on the level.  Embedded items can be polymorphed with a [[wand of polymorph]], but this does not remove them from the wall.

Note that {{lightgray|&nbsp;}} can also represent [[air]].

&&%s&& %s Enchantment {143596 2021-11-08T00:12:10Z {723 Scorchgeek} /* Gloves */ note that enchanting GoP only increase AC because all enchanted armor does this; I found myself wondering if GoP had started giving extra AC! {{otheruses||the school of magic|Enchantment spells}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', an '''enchantment''' is the bonus (or penalty) that some items have (e.g., a ''+1'' [[leather armor]]). A bonus (+) increases the item's power, and a penalty (-) decreases the item's power. An item that is [[cursed]] at the time of its creation is more than likely going to have a penalty - likewise, an item created as blessed will often have a bonus.

==Armor==
When a piece of armor is enchanted, the enchantment is added to the armor's [[AC]] rating.

You can increase the enchantment of armor using a non-cursed [[scroll of enchant armor]].  Be aware that a cursed scroll will ''decrease'' the enchantment.  Other ways to decrease the enchantment include the [[drain life|drain life spell]] and [[disenchanter|disenchanters]].

===Gloves===
*[[Gauntlets of power]].  These gauntlets increase your [[strength]] to 25 regardless of what the enchantment is.  The enchantment increases the AC the gauntlets give (as with any other armor).
** In [[SLASH'EM]], these raise your strength to the 18/**, with further strength being given if the gauntlets are positively enchanted.
*[[Gauntlets of dexterity]].  The enchantment on these gauntlets increases your [[dexterity]] and AC by its enchantment value.

The enchantment on all other gloves acts the same way as for armor.

===Helms===
A [[helm of brilliance]] increases the wearer's [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]] by its enchantment value.

==Weapons==
Attacking with a  [[weapon]] adds its enchantment to the weapon's [[to-hit]]{{refsrc|weapon.c|134}} and [[damage]]{{refsrc|weapon.c|262}} values. For example, attacking with a +1 [[dagger]] would add 1 to the to-hit throw, and 1 to the damage.  You can increase the enchantment of a weapon using a non-cursed [[scroll of enchant weapon]].  As with armor, a cursed scroll will ''decrease'' the enchantment.  Other ways to decrease the enchantment include the [[drain life|drain life spell]] and [[engraving]] with the weapon.

Ascertaining the enchantment of a weapon can be useful, though sometimes tedious.  Your character apparently can make some distinctions because weapons with different enchantments do not [[Stackable|stack]] in inventory, but this doesn't tell you which stack has a better enchantment.  [[Identify#Straightforward_identification|Straightforward identification]] will tell you the exact enchantment of a weapon.  

Ways to informally identify the enchantment of a weapon include
* Studying the weapon's effectiveness in combat.  A [[stethoscope]] is very helpful for this, although early-game characters may notice differences in their chance to hit.
* Attempting to [[engrave]] with the weapon.  Weapons which are "too dull to engrave with" are hindered by a disenchantment of -3 or worse.  If you're fighting with one of these, you should consider finding a better weapon a priority.
* [[Cancellation|Canceling]] a weapon will adjust its enchantment to +0.
* [[Price identification]] can be used to find positively enchanted weapons, but it cannot be used to differentiate non-positive enchantments. 
* Noting the [[BUC]] state the weapon had when it was generated.  Items which were generated blessed <!--It looks like this is also true of uncursed?!  Am I reading the source right? --> (ignoring [[bones]] levels) are never negatively enchanted.  Items generated cursed are often negatively enchanted (though they can also be positively enchanted).

The following methods are useful for [[stackable]] weapons:
* Altering the enchantment of only part of a stack to rank two stacks relative to each other (e.g., engraving with a single dagger from a stack of 10 until it hits -3, thereby determining the enchantment of the remaining 9 items)
* Paying attention to how commonly the items are generated.  Note that you should pay attention to the ''number of stacks of items'' generated, not simply the ''number of items'' generated. (See [[rne|rne(3)]]).
* Formally identifying only one item from a stack and [[name|#naming]] the rest of the stack.

==Rings==
Some rings have an enchantment value associated with them:

*[[ring of adornment]]
*[[ring of gain constitution]]
*[[ring of gain strength]]
*[[ring of increase accuracy]]
*[[ring of increase damage]]
*[[ring of protection]]

The enchantment determines how much the ring modifies your attributes and statistics.  For example, a ''+2 ring of protection'' will lower (i.e. improve) your AC by 2.  You can increase a ring's enchantment by [[charging]] it using a [[scroll of charging]] or [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]].

==Losing enchantment==
There are many ways an item might lose enchantment:

*Enchanting an item too much will cause it to be destroyed.  See [[scroll of enchant armor]], [[scroll of enchant weapon]], and [[charging]] for more information.
*Getting hit by a [[disenchanter]] will decrease enchantment on weapons and armor, and striking a disenchanter with an item will decrease that weapon's enchantment. Disenchanters remove only positive enchantment; a disenchanter will not remove negative enchantment or cause an unenchanted item to gain negative enchantment.
*Reading a cursed scroll of enchant weapon or enchant armor.
*Reading a cursed scroll of charging and selecting a ring as the target.
*[[Engraving]] with an edged weapon other than a non-cursed [[athame]].
*Casting a spell of [[drain life (spell)|drain life]] at the item

[[Erosion]] does not affect the enchantment on an item.

== Spells ==

Spells to-hit calculation is quite different. For ray spells, your to-hit bonus must exceed the result of 4 ''minus'' 1d20.

The calculation  of the to-hit bonus is simple:

* A bonus or penalty from &minus;4 to +3 ([[#Spell skill bonus|see table]]), depending on your [[skill]] with the spell school.{{refsrc|zap.c|2540|comment=skill bonus}}
* A bonus based on your dexterity (see [[#Dexterity bonus|dexterity table]]).{{refsrc|zap.c|2548|comment=spell dexterity bonus}}
* If the monster's AC is non-negative, add the monster's AC.
* If the monster's AC is negative, add a random number between &minus;1 and its AC.

Non-ray spells work differently. {{spell of|Force bolt}} will hit if the roll of a d20 is lower than (10 + target's AC), with no modification for dexterity or skill. Other beam and non-directional spells will always hit, but may be [[Magic resistance (monster)|resisted]].

&&%s&& %s Swimmer {148403 2022-10-04T23:35:58Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} de-SLEX A '''swimmer''' is any [[monster]] that has the <code>M1_SWIM</code> flag set. Only swimmers will be generated on the [[Plane of Water]].{{refsrc|makemon.c|66|version= NetHack 3.6.1}} Swimming is largely similar to [[amphibious]]ness, preventing a monster from [[drowning]].  One difference is that swimming monsters can pick up items underwater{{refsrc|dogmove.c|1263|version= NetHack 3.6.1}}.  Attacking a swimmer with a [[trident]] while it is in water gives a +4 [[to-hit]] bonus.{{refsrc|weapon.c|168|version= NetHack 3.6.1}}

== List of swimmers ==
=== Individual monsters ===
* {{monsymlink|baby crocodile}}
* {{monsymlink|crocodile}}
* {{monsymlink|gremlin}}
* {{monsymlink|mail daemon}}
* {{monsymlink|newt}}
* {{monsymlink|rust monster}}
* {{monsymlink|water demon}}
* {{monsymlink|water elemental}}
* {{monsymlink|water nymph}}
* {{monsymlink|water troll}}
* {{monsymlink|woodchuck}}

=== Entire classes ===
* all snakes:
** {{monsymlink|cobra}}
** {{monsymlink|garter snake}}
** {{monsymlink|pit viper}}
** {{monsymlink|python}}
** {{monsymlink|snake}}
** {{monsymlink|water moccasin}}

** {{monsymlink|electric eel}}
** {{monsymlink|giant eel}}
** {{monsymlink|jellyfish}}
** {{monsymlink|kraken}}
** {{monsymlink|piranha}}
** {{monsymlink|shark}}

=== Unique monsters ===
* {{monsymlink|Medusa}}
* {{monsymlink|Orion}}

== You ==
Swimming property can be obtained by [[polymorph]]ing into one of the above monsters or riding a swimming [[steed]].  It is very similar to [[magical breathing]], allowing you to stay in water but not preventing [[wet|water damage]].  Interestingly, while messages imply that you stay on the surface of water, you still cannot see your surroundings while swimming{{refsrc|trap.c|3693|version= NetHack 3.6.1}}.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], swimming ability can additionally be obtained by wearing [[gauntlets of swimming]] or reaching level 15 as a [[Yeoman]].  It's a bit more desirable property than in vanilla because of the [[create pool]] monster spell, although [[flying]] supersedes it.
