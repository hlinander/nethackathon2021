: [[Ring of polymorph]]
: [[Ring of polymorph control]]

The Polymorph article is getting very, very long. Breakaway articles already exist that can't be easily reincorporated: this proposes to codify and structure the separate articles. To-do notes exist under Polymorph trap and under the Redirect for Polyself--[[User:PeterGFin|PeterGFin]] ([[User talk:PeterGFin|talk]]) 20:54, 11 August 2012 (UTC)

An amphibious monster is able to survive on both land and water. Such a monster is identified by the macro '''amphibious(ptr)'''{{refsrc|include/mondata.h|38|nethack=3.6.6}} which checks for either of the tags '''[[breathless|M1_BREATHLESS]]''' or '''[[M1_AMPHIBIOUS]]''' (see those articles for lists). Note that amphibiousness does not protect items from getting wet.

Also note that, rather confusingly, "amphibious" may include or exclude breathless non-amphibious monsters, depending on which of the macro and the tag is being referred to. Unless the meaning is obvious from context or the distinction is irrelevant, please specify which is meant.

It has 10 [[boulder]]s and 9 [[pit]]s, leaving 1 spare boulder.

Like all Sokoban levels in UnNetHack, this level may be flipped horizontally or vertically.

== Strategy ==

The following solution may not be very fast or organized. Improvements welcome. Like all Sokoban levels it can be solved without making any boulders 'stick'.

All boulders are replaced by letters so they can be referred to. Moving the boulders is shortened to '''r''' for right, '''l''' for left, '''u''' for up, '''d''' for down. An asterisk is used to denote the last move filled a pit (and thus removed the boulder from the game). So "'''N''' ddrr*" means move boulder '''N''' two times down and two times to the right into a pit.

This is the starting position. First, push the closest boulder into a pit:

      -------                  '''F''' d
      |..|..|     --------     '''G''' rrrr r*
 ------..A..--- ---......---

 |.|.|...I..|.--|........|.---
 |......---...| |?.........|
 ------..J..--- ---......---
      |..|..|     --------
      -------

Open up the way to the back area:

      -------                  '''B''' ll
      |..|..|     --------     '''D''' d
 ------..A..--- ---......---   '''B''' rrrr ddrr rrrr*

 |.|.|...I..|.--|........|.---
 |......---...| |?.........|
 ------..J..--- ---......---
      |..|..|     --------
      -------

This makes a few more boulders very easy to deal with:

      -------                  '''A''' rrdd ddrr rrrr r*
      |..|..|     --------     '''E''' uurr rddr rrrr rrr*

 |.|.|...I..|.--|........|.---
 |......---...| |?.........|
 ------..J..--- ---......---
      |..|..|     --------
      -------

The final boulders finish this level:

      -------                  '''J''' rruu uurr rrrr rrrr r*
      |..|..|     --------     '''I''' rruu rrrr rrrr rrrr*

Pick up the two [[scroll of earth|scrolls of earth]] and check under the final boulder in case an item happens to be underneath.

An asterisk is used to denote the last move filled a pit (and thus removed the boulder from the game). So "'''N''' ddrr*" means move boulder '''N''' two times down and two times to the right into a pit.

First, fill in the first three pits with the nearest boulders:

   -------------     '''F''' dddd l*
 --|...........|     '''G''' lddd dll*
 |.+.........<.|     '''A''' lldd dddd lll*

           ---

Collect the two scrolls of earth if they are present and solve two more boulders:

   -------------     '''B''' llll dddd ddll lllu u*

 |...@........|-----
 |??---.......|
 ---- ------>--
           ---

Now open up the room on the right by solving the boulder at the bottom entrance and another nearby almost the same way:

   -------------     '''L''' rrrl llll lddl llll llll uuuu*
 --|...........|     '''H''' dddu rrrr llll lldd llll llll luuu uu*

           ---

One specific boulder needs to be pushed to avoid the remaining boulders getting stuck, but after that the solution is straightforward:

   -------------     '''E''' l

All boulders are replaced by letters so they can be referred to. Moving the boulders is shortened to '''r''' for right, '''l''' for left, '''u''' for up, '''d''' for down. An asterisk is used to denote the last move filled a pit (and thus removed the boulder from the game). So "'''N''' ddrr*" means move boulder '''N''' two times down and two times to the right into a pit.

First, push a couple of boulders out of the way and solve the first boulder, grabbing the [[scroll of earth|scrolls of earth]] in the process:

 ----             '''C''' rrrr

      -----

Now solve the next six boulders:

 ----             '''B''' llll uuud rr*

 |..------------- '''D''' uull lluu udrr rr*

   |.|..L.-------
   |.---..|
   |....|>|
   ----...|
      -----

The next boulder needs to be moved specifically to prevent getting the final boulders stuck, but from there the solution is straightforward:

 ----             '''J''' u

In UnNetHack, as with all Sokoban levels, this level may be flipped horizontally or vertically. In most variants, this floor has 10 [[boulder]]s and [[pit]]s, leaving no spare boulders - in SLASH'EM, there is an extra boulder lying next to the [[lava]] pit.

The lava near the end of the first corridor can not only spell a very quick end to a promising character, but careless movement can also result in losing boulders and forcing you to take a potential [[Luck]] penalty by using up a [[scroll of earth]].
