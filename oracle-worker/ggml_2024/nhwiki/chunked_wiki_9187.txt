&&%s&& %s Ascension kit (dNethack) {140143 2021-05-23T00:36:10Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Tools & miscellaneous items */ Better link {{variant-343}}
The [[ascension kit]] is the nickname given to a set of items that are virtually required for a successful [[ascension]]. The '''dNethack ascension kit''' is similar to the vanilla ascension kit, but has some differences, due to new or increased threats to the player, the addition of new items, and changes to existing items. This article discusses the additional options and concerns presented by dNethack, and how they modify the standard ascension kit selection.

==Common items==
===Armor===

====Cloak====

*'''[[Oilskin cloak]]''': The oilskin cloak now protects your '''entire''' inventory from water damage. Given that the endgame has many Water Elementals and divine spellcasters (with their inventory-wetting geyser and acid rain spells), this cloak is a serious contender for inclusion in the ascension kit. Further, genociding ';' before reaching the Plane of Water causes a large army of (ungenocideable) [[deep one]]s to spawn in the Plane of Water, in place of the native seamonsters.
**Other sources of Water Proofing
***A R'lyehian faceplate (see below).
***An ample supply of [[grease]] for your cloak, [[bag of holding]], and other critical items, or perhaps even an [[oilskin sack]], may be used instead.  A greased cloak will protect your entire inventory; however, because it wears off you will want to also grease or otherwise protect your bag and other critical gear.
*** Permanent intrinsic water-proofing is the passive bonus from reading the [[Word of Creation#The Dividing Word of Creation/Cerulean Glyph|Dividing Word of Creation]] of the [[Mithardir Quest]].
*'''[[Cloak of magic resistance]]''': Two cloaks of MR can be found on the [[Tulani Eladrin]] in the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Arcadian_Tower|Arcadian Tower]].
**Other sources of Magic Resistance
*** The amulet of nullify magic now exists, which grants MR while worn. It will block spellcasting though, so the cloak is likely better for wizards and other spellcasters. 
*** [[Orihalcyon gauntlets]] offer magic resistance in the glove slot. 
*** Magic resistance is offered by numerous dNethack artifacts, and slotless magic resistance can be obtained from two of the [[Alignment quest#Chaos|Chaos Quests]].

====Body armor====
{{main|User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Changes_to_armor}}

*'''[[Dragon scale mail]]''', usually silver or grey: This provides either reflection or magic resistance, 9 base points of [[AC]], and does not hinder spellcasting, but weighs 150 units (fairly heavy) and does not provide [[Magic cancellation]]. The other colors can be used to augment your offensive ability, or to plug a gap left in your energy resistances. Note that dragon scales can also provide resistances when converted into shields; see below. [[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack_Items#Body_armor|The secondary effects]] are also useful.  If you're planning on going for silver dragon scale mail for improved reflection, consider a shield instead.  They don't grant as much AC, but leave the body slot open for either another DSM or for (crystal) plate mail.
*'''Plate mail''', either regular or bronze: When fully enchanted, these provide lower AC than Dragon scale, as well as MC 3, but are heavy at over 200 units, and hinder spellcasting. If you can find high-elven plate (made from mithril, so it doesn't erode), maybe from a bones file, that is by far the better choice.  It gives 1/2 the dex bonus to AC, and weighs only 60 units.
*'''Crystal plate mail''': When highly enchanted, this provides the lowest possible AC, does not hinder spellcasting, and MC 2, but is also the heaviest option at 250 units (1/4 the maximum unburdened carrying capacity).  This can be found at the top of the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Arcadian_Tower|Arcadian Tower]], but it's on the Tulani Eladrin.  A crystal plate mail can also be found in [[Vlad's tower]].  They can be safely enchanted to +7, and each enchantment counts for 2 points of AC.  Their base value is less than a normal plate mail, but fully enchanted they are much better.
*'''Elven mithril-coat''': When enchanted to +7, gives 1 more point of AC than the dwarven variety. Both mithril coats grant MC3 and allow the character to apply their full dex bonus to AC, but still provide less of a bonus to AC than either of the other options. The coats are the lightest possible armor, however, weighing in at 40 units for dwarven and 20 units for elven coats.

====Boots====
*Boots with the "Hiking Boots" random appearance give a 100 unit boost to your carrying capacity when worn, and are therefore useful for carrying a larger kit. This can inform your choice between speed boots and jumping boots, if one of those types happens to have gotten this appearance.  
*Very fast speed can also be gained from blue dragon scale mail/shield, so that may favor blue DSM/S in combination with jumping boots.
*Boots with the appearance "Mud Boots" can also be very useful, as they protect you from drowning attacks. Mud boots in combination with a R'lyehian faceplate can replace a oilskin cloak, but you still won't be able to see.
*'''Flying boots''': Replace levitation boots, and are much easier to put to good use.

====Helmet====
*'''Helm of drain resistance''': Since there are a few more sources of level drain in dNethack than in vanilla Nethack, drain resistance is a more useful property. Most players get by fine without this, though.
*'''Cornuthaum''': As it provides [[MC]]2 from a slot other than the cloak or body armor slots, it can be helpful when fighting [[nightgaunt#dNethack|nightgaunts]].

====Shield====
*'''Dragon Scale Shields''': Dragon scales can be converted into a dragon scale shield via confused enchant armor. A dragon scale shield can be used to plug a gap in your resistances, but is inconveniently heavy at 75 units. They provide 3 points of AC and can be enchanted to +5. 
*'''Shield of reflection''': No longer reflects dragon breath, so a silver dragon scale shield is a much better choice.

====Shirt====
*'''Ruffed shirt''': This grants a point of Charisma, but for all intents is interchangeable with the vanilla shirts.
*'''Victorian underwear''': This grants [[MC3]] as well as providing an extra enchantable item, but its restrictive nature means that it also costs you 2 points of AC. A +5 set of underwear, therefore, provides only +3 net AC. Since it is not a cloak or suit of body armor, yet provides high MC, it can be very helpful when fighting [[nightgaunt#dNethack|nightgaunts]].

===Rings===
*'''Engagement ring''': This is a random appearance, rather than a separate type of ring. Engagement rings grant immunity to seduction attacks, in addition to their normal abilities. If you find yourself facing Pale Night, Belial, Malcanthet, Lilith, or Graz'zt, this ring may prove essential.
*'''Rings of energy resistance''': Since you can no longer gain permanent energy resistances from eating corpses, these rings are more valuable. [[Crowning]] provides a full suite of intrinsic energy resistances, but if you don't get crowned, or if a [[gremlin]], [[phantasm]], or unique monster steals one of your resistances, you can use one or more of these rings to plug the gaps.  Note that the elemental crystals from Version 1 of the Chaos Quest can provide shock, cold, and fire resistance.  This only leaves sleep, disintegration, and poison resistance.
*'''Ring of Free Action''': There are many more opportunities in dNethack for monsters to paralyze the player, and that tends to end in death. Some source of free action (and the ring is one of the easiest) is nearly as necessary as magic resistance.

===Amulets===
*'''Amulet of drain resistance''': Since there are a few more sources of level drain in dNethack than in vanilla Nethack, drain resistance is a more useful property. Most players get by fine without this, though.
*'''Amulet versus curses''': Situational. If you're going to be fighting, say, a devil lord that likes the ''curse items'' monster spell, this may be useful.  It gives 100% resistance to this effect. It's almost always better to wear an amulet of life saving instead.
*'''Amulet of reflection''': As amulets of reflection no longer reflect dragon breath, this may not be as good a choice anymore.  A silver dragon scale mail/shield will, and may be a better choice.
*'''Amulet of nullify magic''': Bad choice for spellcasters, as it will block your own spellcasting. However, it grants magic resistance when worn. May be useful if you can't find/don't want a cloak of magic resistance or GDSM/S

===Tools & miscellaneous items===
*'''R'lyehian faceplate''': When worn over your eyes, this item protects your entire inventory from water, but blinds you (the visor is opaque, or perhaps transparent in a part of the spectrum outside your visual range). Given that the endgame has many Water Elementals and divine spellcasters (with their inventory-wetting geyser and acid rain spells), some form of waterproofing is essential.  Note that these are somewhat rare, but can be dropped by deep(er, est) ones and (master) mind flayers.
**Other sources of waterproofing: see notes above under [[Ascension kit (dNethack)#Armor|armor]].

===Wands===
*'''[[Wand of opening]]''': Divine spellcasters (such as the priests on the Astral Plane) love to [[punish]] you. This wand (or the [[Knock]] spell) is an essential countermeasure.

===Stoning Countermeasures===
*Some high-level arcane spellcasters can cast Turn-to-stone as a monster spell. This spell is partially, but not completely, blocked by a [[lizard corpse]] in open inventory (much like a [[cockatrice]]'s hissing attack).
**Therefore, you need at least one lizard corpse in open inventory at all times, as well as a means to cure stoning (possibly a second lizard corpse). Do not depend on a single lizard corpse for both, eating it would mean that you no longer resist the spell, and could immediately be affected a second time.
***You should keep all items that allow you to cure stoning that you find in the game, and bring them on your ascension run in your [[bag of holding]]. You ''probably'' won't be affected by Turn-to-Stone more than once or twice in the entire game, but better safe than sorry!
**Some races can't eat, and therefore can't use lizard corpses to cure stoning. These races will need potions of acid, lizard blood, or acidic blood for this purpose. They still need a single lizard corpse to help them resist Turn-to-Stone.
** As an alternative, yellow dragon scale mail provides extrinsic stoning resistance.  Note that [[Medusa]] in dNethack is tameable.  Stoning resistance, pet blind Medusa, and a light source make a powerful combination.  Because she remains susceptible to reflection, the easiest way to grant stoning resistance to Medusa is by blinding her.

===Quest Artifact===
*The [[Wizard of Yendor]] can no longer steal your [[quest artifact]], so in many cases it can now serve as a reliable source of useful extrinsics.
*You can no longer [[wish]] for any quest artifacts (though you may still find other roles' quest artifacts in bones files). Therefore, the contribution of quest artifacts varies from role to role.}

A '''potion of ESP''' is a [[potion]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]]. It grants [[intrinsic]] [[telepathy]] temporarily if uncursed and permanently if blessed. If cursed, removes intrinsic telepathy.

==Strategy==

A character is by no means guaranteed to find a [[floating eye]] corpse; a blessed potion of ESP can be a useful way to gain the intrinsic for such unlucky ones.  They are also useful for non-chaotic characters wishing to commit [[murder]] who lack a [[tinning kit]].

For players who already possess telepathy and don't anticipate losing it, these potions are a good candidate for dilution.

The Underground Rivers patch adds streams of water or lava to random rooms-and-corridors levels in the Dungeons of Doom. According to the readme, dungeons below dlvl 13 occasionally generate with rivers, either of water or lava. The code doesn't check for blocking the way, so there's a chance you might need either cross the river or dig around it to get to the stairs. Special rooms are not affected by the river.

This patch does not invalidate bones or saves.

This page contains the new information.

==''SLASH'EM'' roles==
''[[SLASH'EM]]'' has several new roles with varying levels of difficulty. Also, some of the original roles are more or less difficult in ''SLASH'EM'' than in vanilla ''[[NetHack]]'', due to differences in starting equipment, skills, abilities, and the character of the game. Below is a rough, subjective ordering of difficulty of various SLASH'EM roles, incorporating some stats on ascensions from the SLASH'EM server at slashem.crash-override.net.

{|class="wikitable"
!Rank

!Ascension rate*
|-
|1||[[Valkyrie]]||Starts with spear instead of long sword, but still the easiest; [[Mjollnir]] much more powerful in SLASH'EM||24%

|2||[[Samurai]]||Fast speed more important in early game where you must flee often; Snickersnee and Excalibur make powerful weapon combo; charged 2x more in shops||13%
|-
|3||[[Knight]]||Start with [[plate mail]], [[long sword]], Str 18/**; much weaker as a spellcaster than in Vanilla||10%

Note: Ascension rate equals the percentage of games for each role that ended in ascension on slashem.crash-override.net as of Feb. 13, 2013, given that (1) the race was not Doppelganger (too easy) or Vampire/Lycanthrope (too difficult), (2) the player had achieved at least one ascension on the server, and (3) at least 20 qualifying games had been played for that role. N/A indicates a sample size of < 20.

In SLASH'EM, race is often more of a factor than role in determining success. In particular, [[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppelgangers]] are far and away the most powerful race to play, [[Drow]] are extremely hardy in early game thanks to their barehanded sleep attack, and [[Vampire (starting race in SLASH'EM)|Vampires]] and [[Lycanthrope (starting race)|Lycanthropes]] are extremely challenging.

==[[dNetHack]] roles==

!Role
!Starting Difficulty
!Quest Difficulty
!Ascension Difficulty
!Notes
|-
|'''Archeologist'''
| Normal.  The starting +2 bullwhip makes an ok early weapon, the starting pickaxe simplifies exploration and allows early vault access, the starting touchstone allows early identification of valuable stones.
| Normal. The Minion of Huhetotl hits quite hard and can cast spells, but he can be warded off.
| Normal. Archeologists have no major advantages or disadvantages going into the end game.
|
|-
|'''Anachrononaut'''
| Easy.  Good AC and strong weapons make short work of early monsters.  Lack of prayer means that mistakes can be fatal, though.
| Very Hard.  Abundant mind flayers, which can't be genocided due to the nature of the quest.  Beware of long-ranged death from mind blasts.  Additionally, enemies in the quest tend to use future tech weapons, which are very high damage.
| Easy. Future tech complements the standard ascension kit well.
|
|-
|'''Barbarian'''
| Easy.  Strong starting weapon and stats makes up for bad AC.
| Normal. Thoth Amon's spellcasting can pose a problem to non-magic resistant Barbarians, but his HP is unimpressive and a fast Barbarian can catch him off guard and kill him with the bonus melee attacks.
| Easy.  The Barbarian's iterative attacks and full BAB gives them nearly unrivaled damage output.  The quest artifact is very powerful, providing several necessary resistances and giving unlimited uncurse.  MR and reflection are also provided, leaving the armor slots open for something like dNetHack's improved [[crystal plate mail]]. A fully enchanted crystal plate mail can give ''30'' AC! (16 base + 14 for enchantment)
|
|-
|'''Binder'''
| Hard. Bad starting weapons, bad AC, lousy stats.  Lucky draws for the first three spirits simplify the early game, otherwise progress slowly through the dungeon and let your pet do the bulk of the fighting.
| Hard. The Binder needs to convert three temples, and thus have to deal with the three angry aligned priests, which are powerful on their own rights, as well as the minions summoned by the altars. The nemesis himself, Acererak, is a very tough foe with life-draining attacks and spell casting.
| Easy.  Once a Binder reaches the level cap and unlocks all their spirits, they become extremely powerful.  A Binder with Gauntlets of Power and melee spirits bound rivals the Barbarian's damage output.
| A Binder's overall power increases strongly with character level, unlike other roles who's overall power depends more on the equipment they find.  Orcish Binders almost don't need equipment.
|-
|'''Caveperson'''
| Normal.  Decent starting weapon and stats makes short work of early enemies.
| Hard. The Chromatic Dragon possesses over 500 HP, -20 AC, very damaging attacks and various spells, including summon nasties. She can be warded off with a scroll of scare monster, but even then it can take a very long time before she finally goes down, and during this time the scroll can be destroyed by a stray fire bolt.
| Normal. Cavepersons have no major advantages or disadvantages going into the end game.
|
|-
|'''Convict'''
| Hard.  Low starting nutrition and bad starting alignment makes early starvation a distinct threat.  The heavy iron ball deals a lot of damage but has bad to-hit.
| Easy. Warden Arianna's combat power is unimpressive, though the various prison guards and the lava demon around her lair can hit hard.
| Normal.  Convicts don't become unusually powerful, though the artifacts they pick up on the quest greatly increase their carrying capacity, and allow them to phase through walls, which opens up some unique options.
|
|-
|'''Healer'''
| Hard.  Low damage starting weapon, low to-hit due to stats, and bad AC makes melee difficult.  No offensive spells or starting ranged weapon makes melee difficult to avoid.  Healing spells increase survivability, but low starting food makes starvation a worry.
| Hard. There are several dragons in each level, which can pose a problem for Healers lacking a decent weapon. More dangerously, the quest nemesis can wield the artifact against you, but he can be warded off.
| Hard.  The quest artifact is a good weapon, but is two-handed and thus can be a liability in the lategame.  Healers are saddled with a 1/2 BAB, which means they may have trouble hitting things in melee, even at level 30.  Finally, they may have trouble casting attack spells, due to their low skill caps in those schools.
|
|-
|'''Knight'''
| Easy. Decent starting weapon and armor. The starting long sword gives easy access to [[dNetHack artifacts#Excalibur|Excalibur]].
| Hard. There is a unique red dragon on the quest home, and the quest nemesis is a spell casting nymph.
| Easy. Their quest artifact lets them cast very damaging magic missile and cone of cold spells. Blessed Excalibur is fine endgame weapon, as is the [[dNetHack artifacts#The Rod of Seven Parts|Rod of Seven Parts]].
|-
|'''Monk'''
| Easy.  Punch all the things.  The need to avoid body armor means AC will be bad. The possible starting spells (healing, sleep or protection) all help with greatly increasing early game survivability.
| Normal. Master Kaen hits very hard, can cast spells and cannot be warded off with regular wards. Going toe-to-toe against him is usually suicide, so a Monk will need ways to damage him without retaliation. However, a well-enchanted Premium Heart, a means of sleep, and ideally free action can possibly make the quest easier. A triple Gorgoneion on the upstair might help as well.
| Normal.  Martial arts are only so-so by default, but can be improved through artifacts.  Monks are likely to be gifted artifact armor, most of which is quite good.
|
|-
|'''Madman'''
| Very Hard.  The Madman begins the game stuck in a straitjacket (which prevents the use of hands), their gods start angry at them, they don't have a traditional pet, and occasionally find monsters disguised as other monsters. While skillful play can allow surprising progress to be made even in the face of all of these disadvantages, the Madman may ultimately depend on the RNG to provide a means of escaping the jacket. Playing as a Vampire can help the madman survive the early game.
| Normal. The madman needs a unicorn horn and a decent weapon to take on the quest, and care must be taken around the quest enemies. However, the nemesis, while resilient, is not a serious threat.
| Normal.  Madmen have no strong pluses or minuses going in to the late game. They do, however, need to be careful about gaining too much insight too quickly.
| Madmen are a bit more incentivized than other roles to explore the depths of the Neutral Quest, which can be painful to vampires due to the amount of silver-damage found in the upper sections of the Neutral Quest. However, they also obtain a lot of the same rewards from their quest.
|-
|'''Noble'''
| Normal.  Starts with a +2 rapier, but only so-so AC.  First Gift is a 2x damage melee weapon.
| Hard.  The quest nemesis is a team of 4 adventurers, resulting in a surprisingly high damage output.
| Normal.  The 2x damage First Gift and artifact cloak quest item can help the Noble fill out their ascension kit more easily than normal; however, they don't really increase the Noble's power beyond that of other well-prepared roles.
|
|-
|'''Elven Noble'''
| Easy.  AC starts ok and has room to be easily improved.  The +2 starting spear makes short work of early enemies.  The First Gift is a 2x damage melee weapon.  As an Elf, can use Elbereth.
| Normal.  The quest nemesis is a spell casting wraith with a draining gaze; however, it is able to be warded off.
| Normal. Your racial artifacts are quite strong, but your limited spell casting will make it difficult to eliminate dangerous enemies from a distance. Wands, strong pets, and warding will be of value to you in the late game.
|
|-
|'''Female Droven Noble'''
| Easy.  Very good starting AC, if only so-so weapons (The +2 whip is ok but not great, the crossbow is more powerful but will run out of ammo quickly). First gift is a 2x damage two-handed sliver melee weapon. Light-blindness does make the Gnomish Mines far more dangerous for drow than for other races.
| Insanely Hard.  Abundant mind flayers, which can't be genocided due to the nature of the quest.  Beware of long-ranged death from mind blasts.  The nemesis is an Elder Brain, who will absolutely destroy unprepared characters, with powerful mage 'and' divine spells and a '2-square' reaching intelligence-draining attack.  It's almost impossible to do without a wand of death for the nemesis, and a crystal helm (which blocks all head tentacle attacks) will help you keep your intelligence. Standing just out of range and spamming the fire storm spell can make this quest considerably easier.
| Normal.  The 2x damage First Gift and artifact cloak quest item can help the Noble fill out their ascension kit more easily than normal; however, they don't really increase the Noble's power beyond that of other well-prepared roles.
|
|-
|'''Male Droven Noble'''
| Easy, very similar to default nobles.  The +2 starting rapier makes up for only so-so AC.  First Gift is a 2x damage melee weapon.
| Normal.  The quest nemesis can't be warded away, hits hard, and has a disease causing melee attack, but she is not resistant to death rays.  She is equipped with both a wand of death and an amulet of life saving.
| Normal.  The 2x damage First Gift and artifact cloak quest item can help the Noble fill out their ascension kit more easily than normal; however, they don't really increase the Noble's power beyond that of other well-prepared roles.
|
|-
|'''Dwarven Noble'''
| Normal.  Decent starting weapon but only so-so AC.  As a dwarf, the mines are safer.  First gift is good artifact armor, which also confers MR.
| Easy. Other than the Watcher in the Water, which can largely be avoided, there is little challenge to this quest. The hordes of orcs will be low level and a good source of random items, and Durin's Bane can be warded against or even simply tanked out if necessary.
| Normal. The artifacts from your Quest work well together and can bear you through much of the game if they need to. The lack of ranged weaponry, however, can lead to some dangerous situations in Gehennom, so a good selection of wands or some other source of ranged damage may be necessary as well.
|
|-
|'''Priest'''
| Normal.  Decent starting weapon, and the ability to know BUC enables easy AC improvement.
| Normal. The high volume of undead can be taken care off with turn undead. The nemesis hits quite hard and can cast spells, but he can be warded off.
| Normal.  The quest artifact is a bit weak, but that can be compensated for without too much trouble.  The low skill caps can be troublesome, but Priests are at least a 3/4 BAB role.  Priests can also invoke artifacts a bit more frequently than other roles.  Priests also always receive the to-hit bonus granted by artifact weapons, even when attacking foes it would not normally apply vs.
|
|-
|'''Pirate'''
| Normal. High starting weapon skill and the flintlock can win most early game fights.
| Easy. A Pirate that can survive against the soldiers and skeletal pirates will find no problem fighting Blackbeard's ghost.
| Normal.  The Pirate's special rules for artifacts constrain them a bit, but their skill caps are fine, their crowning gift is decent, and their quest artifact converts some enemies into weaker pirate enemies. By the end of the game, they should have plenty of artifacts to choose from for their weapons.  Getting expert saber is nice, but skilled-expert axe, flail, spear, trident, crossbow, and more means that almost artifact can be used well in the right hands.  The sacrifice gift helps you identify these.
|
|-
|'''Rogue'''
| Normal. The starting stack of daggers can be thrown to take out enemies from afar. Furthermore in dNetHack, the daggers can be dipped in the potion of sickness for a very damaging ranged option.  Rogues can also have a small stack of daggers coated with paralysis venom (#dip into a potion of paralysis) to deal with more dangerous enemies.
| Normal. The Master Assassin is not a threat, however the cruel level design means a Rogue needs to be prepared when entering the quest.
| Normal.  Rogues have a very damaging attack option in the form of highly enchanted thrown daggers, that can serve as the main weapon during the endgame.
|
|-
|'''Ranger'''
| Normal. The cloak of displacement and bow can help easily avoid and take out early game foes, but the limited supplies of arrows must be managed carefully.
| Easy. Scorpius's disease attacks can be mitigated with a unicorn horn, and outside of it he's not very impressive in melee.
| Easy. Rangers can fire very damaging volleys of arrows from their quest artifact.  Depending on alignment, the quest gift will be a small stack of unbreakable artifact ammo.
|
|-
|'''Gnome Ranger'''
| Normal. The cloak of displacement and crossbow can help easily avoid and take out early game foes, but the limited supplies of bolts must be managed carefully.  Gnomes take the quest early, however.
| Easy. Gnomes can enter the quest at level 6, and can easily complete the quest at that level.  The quest can be reached from the Gnomish Mines by dropping down through any hole.  The quest artifact is very powerful.
| Easy.  The quest artifact is as good as the normal Ranger quest artifact, and helps stretch ammo supplies.  The two bolts are each almost as powerful as a full volley from the Longbow.
| 
|-
|'''Samurai'''
| Easy. Very good weapons, very good armor.
| Normal. Ashikaga Takauji's instakilling attacks pose a very grave threat, but he's not magic resistant and thus should be taken out in one turn with a wand of death.
| Normal.  The quest artifact is quite good, but is two handed and should be replaced during the lategame.
|
|-
|'''Tourist'''
| Hard. They must rely on their limited supply of darts in order to fix their lack of melee weapons and bad AC. The weapons that they can become somewhat proficient on (unicorn horns and sabers) are also hard to find in the early game.
| Easy. The Master of Thieves poses no threat to Tourists that can make it to the quest.
| Easy. Tourists have unlimited charging from the quest artifact, and can wish for future tech from the Anachrononaut role.  Tourists are, however, a 1/2 BAB role, and therefore can have trouble hitting high AC opponents, so care must still be taken.
|
|-
|'''Troubadour'''
| Hard. No starting weapons (unless you're an orcish troubadour), bad weapon skills and weak AC means they have to rely on buffing pets and have them do the fighting. On the upside, Troubadours gain EXP observing their pets kill enemies.  Troubadours can also build up skill with thrown daggers, which helps a lot in this phase of the game.
| Normal. Aglaope's main strategy is teleporting you to her, clawing and robbing you before teleporting away to heal. Troubadours possessing teleport control and an engagement ring can chase after her and beat her face in safety, otherwise she can be a very annoying foe. By this point, the Troubadour should probably be using a stack of daggers as their main attack.
| Hard.  Troubadours' bad weapon skills continue to be a liability in this phase of the game, as as a 1/2 BAB role they may have trouble hitting high AC enemies.  By this point their pets are probably very impressive, however.  A crystal armored Tulani with an artifact weapon, buffed by your beastmaster skill and your songs, can kill almost anything in the game.  The Troubadour may also wish for an Archon or Solar figurine.
| 
|-
|'''Valkyrie'''
| Normal. Average weapon, average armor and good stats give them an average early game.
| Easy. With fire resistance, the quest level and the nemesis's [[dNetHack artifacts#Sol Valtiva|weapon]] poses little threat. Flying/levitation is essential to get past the lava pools.
| Easy.  With all three Valkyrie weapons (Sol Valtiva, Mjollnir, and the Bow of Skadi) Valkyries have access to the three major elemental damage types.  They can use Mjollnir and the Bow of Skadi in gehennom, and Sol Valtiva against angels and other non-fire-resistant foes.  Lawful Valkyries can also use the Rod of Seven Parts.
|
|-
|'''Wizard'''
| Hard. Low damage starting weapon, low to-hit due to stats, and bad AC makes melee difficult. Force Bolt can easily kill most early game threats, but weak power supply limits its use. Furthermore, most early game AC solutions hamper with spellcasting, so a Wizard looking to improve their AC usually have to give up Force Bolt. Their first gift, Magicbane, is a very decent melee weapon though.
| Normal. The Dark One's Flesh to Stone spell can cause delayed instant death, so several lizard corpses/stone to flesh spell is crucial. His other spells can be threatening, but with Magicbane most of them should be nullified.
| Easy. With the various attack spells (finger of death, magic missile and fireball/cone of cold) as well as the powerful [[dNetHack artifacts#High-level artifacts|Wizard-exclusive nameable artifacts]], late game Wizards should be able to demolish everything in their way.
|
|-
|'''Incantifier Wizard'''
| Easy.  The massive quantities of power make casting spells incredibly easy.  Once he is confident, a incantifier wizard can easily clear the mines.  Make sure to grab any enchanted items, and stash it for food later.  Incantifier wizards can also quickly improve their AC by keeping an eye out for enchanted gear.  And make sure to watch your HP, as incantifiers don't naturally regen health.
| Easy. Intrinsic magic resistance is nice, and the starting robe is quite useful for casting harder spells later.  Keep an eye out for rings with positive extrinsics, and consider eating some to gain it.  Rings of regeneration are very useful, as the extra hunger penalty doesn't seem to affect an incantifier  For the quests, make sure to bring lizard corpses in addition to acid, to prevent the Dark One's Flesh-to-Stone spell.  Lizards provide some resistance versus this, even if you can't eat them.  
| Easy. Easy permanent intrinsics via ring eating, the Silver Key slows down food consumption massively (energy regen while carried), and the massive mana pool and spellcasting bonus provides easier casts of high-level spells.

'''fg''' (mnemonic: "'''f'''ore'''g'''round") is a generic Linux/Unix utility that resumes execution of a suspended process.

Sometimes, unwary users press {{kbd|Ctrl|Z}} by accident. This suspends the game and puts it in the background, giving a message similar to:

 "[1]+ Stopped        nethack"

Attempting to restart the game by rerunning "nethack" will give the message:

"There is already a game in progress under your name. Destroy old game? [yn]"

Say "no" to the above; you need to run the command "fg" in the original terminal to resume the frozen game. 

If you have already killed the original terminal, then try killing nethack with "killall nethack"; then you might need to use the [[recover]] utility.

== Expert Farming ==
This expert farming guide is written for users who want to farm without the assistance of bots.

== Mandatory requirements ==
* A weak iron weapon, a -3 dagger works fine
* A wand of fire/lightning for engraving 'Elbereth'
* A pick-axe or other digging tool to create a nice hiding nook
* Some Initial Food
* A Black Pudding or a Sink to generate one
* A Container of some sort (Not a Bag Of Holding)
* Enough hit-points to survive several black pudding bites

== Useful requirements ==
* A ring of slow digestion, this should be one of your first priorities, once you have this you can start farming much faster
* Reflection & Magic Resistance
* A scroll of Earth on case a monster gets away with a wand of digging or to generate a boulder fort if necessary
* A wand of striking, In case a boulder shows up
* A Unicorn Horn
* An Altar
* Boots of Speed
* A stethoscope, only really useful for initial farming

== Preparation ==
First, you need to find a level with either a Sink or method of generating a black pudding. A Sink can be kicked multiple times and always has a chance of spawning a pudding before it breaks. Be aware that it is possible to spawn a foocubus before a pudding, so be prepared.

Ideally you want to find a level with an altar for offerings. However, this won't be all that useful. Once you start farming fast, you won't need an Altar as every non-quest artifact has a chance of being dropped.

Once you have located a method of spawning a Pudding (or found a level with one available), the next thing you need to do is prepare your farming location. Ideally an [[Elbereth]] engraved stairs is a good choice, as it allows you to leave the level if necessary. A common farming locations may look like this:

<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[Player|{{white|@}}]]
P={{black|P}}

      ##P@
 -----.------
 |..........|
 ...........|
 |....{.....|
 |..........|
 |..........|
 ---.--------
</replacecharsblock></div>

The above farming location has various pros and cons:
* It provides shelter from attacks from multiple angles
* The P(udding) square puts you in harms way by one Monster
* You have no escape
* Attack wands are still able hit you

A slightly better setup might be:
<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[Player|{{white|@}}]]
P={{black|P}}

      @
      #
       #
      #
 -----.------
 |..........|
 ...........|
 |....{.....|
 |..........|
 |..........|
 ---.--------
</replacecharsblock></div>

The only advantage this offers is that you can no-longer be targeted easily by attack wands. However this creates an issue where large monsters may block the passage of Black Puddings.

Once you have a farming location setup. Drop a chest and engrave 'Elbereth' on you Home square. Now Generate a Black Pudding and begin by splitting it slowly. You will find that if you aren't careful, that you may be able to kill off the initial puddings if they aren't given enough time to regain their health. Once you have a large amount of puddings ready you can begin automation.

== Automation ==
If you don't wish to use some sort of bot, you can make your farming on some servers easier by using MSGTYPE and AUTOPICKUP options.

=== MSGTYPE ===
Once you have a small farm going, you can begin an automation process. On some servers, this is significantly easier than vanilla nethack due to the MSGTYPE addition.

Edit your config and insert the following:


 #msgtypes for instant death!
 MSGTYPE=stop "The couatl swings itself around you!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "The electric eel swings itself around you!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "The giant eel swings itself around you!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "The kraken swings itself around you!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "The python grabs you!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "You don't feel very well."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are turning a little green."
 MSGTYPE=stop "Your limbs are getting oozy."
 MSGTYPE=stop "Your skin begins to peel away."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are turning into a green slime."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are slowing down."
 MSGTYPE=stop "Your limbs are stiffening."
 MSGTYPE=stop "It constricts your throat!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "You find it hard to breathe."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You're gasping for air."
 MSGTYPE=stop "Your blood is having trouble reaching your brain."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You can no longer breathe."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You're turning blue."
 MSGTYPE=stop "Your consciousness is fading."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You feel deathly sick."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You feel much worse."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You feel even worse."
 MSGTYPE=stop "* needs food, badly!"
 
 ##msgtype for pudding farming
 MSGTYPE=hide "You hit the black pudding*"
 MSGTYPE=hide "The * divides as you hit it!"
 MSGTYPE=hide "Your * looks completely corroded."
 MSGTYPE=hide "You kill the *!"
 MSGTYPE=hide "The * turns to flee!"
 MSGTYPE=hide "You attack thin air."
 MSGTYPE=hide "You hear a slow drip."
 MSGTYPE=hide "You miss the *"
 MSGTYPE=hide "You hear the footsteps of a guard on patrol."
 MSGTYPE=hide "You caitiff!"
 MSGTYPE=hide "The * oozes under the door."
 MSGTYPE=hide "It divides as you hit it!"
 MSGTYPE=hide "Your * feels completely corroded."
 MSGTYPE=hide "You hear a * howling at the moon."
 MSGTYPE=stop "The * hits!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "The * strikes at you*"
 MSGTYPE=stop "The * swings *"
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are jolted with electricity!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are splashed*"
 MSGTYPE=hide "Your long sword named Excalibur is not affected."
 MSGTYPE=stop "There are many objects*"
 MSGTYPE=stop "*digging*" #You want to know when someone uses a / of digging
 MSGTYPE=hide "The ware*changes*"
 MSGTYPE=stop "*are suddenly very hot!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "*are jolted with electricity!"
 MSGTYPE=stop "*are suddenly very cold!"
 
 #Testing for scroll detection
 MSGTYPE=stop "*a scroll*"
 MSGTYPE=stop "*boulder*"
 
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are beginning to feel hungry."
 MSGTYPE=stop "*faint*"
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are getting the munchies"
 MSGTYPE=stop "You are beginning to feel weak."
 MSGTYPE=stop "*weak*"
 MSGTYPE=stop "You faint from lack of food."
 MSGTYPE=stop "You regain consciousness."
 MSGTYPE=stop "*confuse*"


The message types defined above will pause your farming when any of the following conditions are met:

* You need food
* You find a scroll of scare monster
* You attack a monster that passively damages you
* You become confused
* You become in a situation where instant death is possible
* When a monster picks up or uses a Wand of Digging

=== Auto-pickup ===

The following auto-pickup options will pickup all money, potions, wands, rings, amulets and scrolls. It also has some exceptions that will pickup magic markers and magic lamps.

 OPTIONS=autopickup,pickup_types:$!/="?

 autopickup_exception="<*magic marker*"
 autopickup_exception="<*magic lamp*"
 autopickup_exception="<*lamp called magic"

When you stand on your Pudding square, you will automatically pickup all the items above, you can then move back to your Elbereth square and put all of the following items back in your chest. 

=== Paste Farming ===

The following example below will constantly attack left, check for scrolls, and save occasionally to prevent NAO crashes.

 ;h;FhFhFhFhFhFhFhFhF;h;FhFhFhFhFhFhFhFhF

Repeat this as many times as you like, Ideally you want to end this just before you become hungry, and end it with a 'Sy' so that your game is saved. NAO has issues in the past with long farming sessions where it may corrupt your game. Saving and quitting occasionally seems to prevent this.

== Farming interruptions ==

There are still some conditions you need to manually resolve, should they arise:
* You need to eat food
* You need to kill some monsters that aren't puddings that stand on your farming square
* You need to resolve being stunned/confused/blinded/hallucinated
* A wand of digging is used
* A boulder is dropped on you or your pudding square
* A scroll of scare monster is dropped

Of all the above, the wand of digging situation can be the most frustrating to deal with. If a monster manages to pickup and use a wand of digging on your Pudding square the contents of that square get scattered several dungeon levels below you. It also creates a hole that you need to fill. Be sure to carry a scroll of earth in case this situation arrives.

A boulder (usually from a giant) being dropped on you or your pudding square is also a likely situation over a long farming session. Make sure you have a pickaxe, and a wand of striking.
<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
@=[[Player|{{white|@}}]]
0=[[boulder|{{white|0}}]]

      ##0@
 -----.------
 |..........|
 ...........|
 |....{.....|
 |..........|
 |..........|
 ---.--------
</replacecharsblock></div>
In the situation above, lets assume a boulder was also thrown at you and has landed on your Elbereth Square. First, make sure there are no items on your square that can be destroyed by a striking blast. Use your pickaxe (not your wand of striking) to destroy the boulder(s) to the left. Move left and then use your wand of striking to destroy the boulder on your Elbereth Square.

== Cleaning your pudding square ==
Occasionally you are going to want to 'clean' your pudding square. NAO doesn't deal well with 100's of pages. The easiest way to do this is with a wand of polymorph. Make sure you have a bunch of AC, HP and a decent weapon and stand on your pudding square and zap downwards. This will cause a few items to be destroyed. Be careful of generated [[golem]]s though!

== Making wishes ==
After a while, you will get an abundant supply of smokey potions, magic lamps and maybe a few wands of wishing. While wands of wishing can be used while you are standing on your Elbereth square, the potions and lamps both required a empty tile for a Genie to be generated. Instead of using potions or lamps on your Elbereth square, use them on your pudding square while your Elbereth square is empty.

'''Great Cthulhu''' is a monster from the [[dNetHack]] variant.

==Strategy==
Great Cthulhu is the second or third most dangerous creature in dNetHack, and as such should be avoided rather than confronted. Great Cthulhu is generated asleep on one of the altars in R'lyeh, and plan A should always be to keep him that way. Great Cthulhu can be sensed from standard warning distance (13&times;13) as "an unknown monster causing you dread" regardless of whether or not you have [[warning]]. Beware of squeaky boards near the upstair, as these can cause him to awaken. You may also want a [[wand of opening]] to lower the drawbridge, as the [[wand of striking]] will make a loud noise. If he spawns in one of the hidden side rooms, he will not be able to get out due to his large size.

Should the character need to approach Great Cthulhu, it is vitally important to avoid looking at him. Extinguish light sources and remain out of sight or blind yourself. Great Cthulhu's gaze attack ''permanently'' reduces wisdom by 1d10 points, though not below 3. In this case, the character's wisdom is reduced to 3 and the character then takes 10 damage for each point of wisdom drain remaining. You will also suffer amnesia, including losing 25% of ''all'' spell memories. For this reason, it's best not to light up the level (it is naturally dark). Sustain ability prevents both the drain and damage, but not the amnesia.  

It is vitally important to remain at least 2 squares away from Great Cthulhu if at all possible, as his melee attack deals around 250 damage on average and is essentially guaranteed to hit.
