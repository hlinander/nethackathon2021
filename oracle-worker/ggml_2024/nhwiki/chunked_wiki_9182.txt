Chokhmah Sephiroth can duplicate the attacks of any of the lesser Keter. Additionally, Chokhmah Sephiroth grow in power with each Chokhmah that is sent out, increasing their speed, damage, magic resistance, and AC.

* to keep track of various in-game resources such as [[shops]], [[fountains]], [[altars]], etc.
* to keep track of various events, such as [[prayer timeout]].
* to preserve some information in the event the character has a bad encounter with [[scroll of amnesia|amnesia]].
* to learn from their mistakes.

While this wiki provides information on universal facts ("is it safe to eat a [[kobold]] corpse?"), a player's notes serve to record information specific to the game they are playing that may change from game to game ("which floor has the entrance to [[Sokoban]]?").

The game provides a limited amount of in-game note-taking ability in the [[dungeon overview]], which automatically tracks many things one would want to write down anyway. [[Name|Naming]] items with intrinsics the character has gained or other useful facts is another common method. For other forms of note taking, a separate text-editing window, screenshots, or physical pen-and-paper can be used.

== Things worth noting ==

=== Dungeon features ===
[[NetHack 3.6.0]] added the [[overview]] and [[annotate]] commands, which allow you to keep in-game notes of the dungeon overview. Dungeon features such as sinks, fountains, and altars, special rooms such as [[shops]] and [[temples]], most special levels, and dungeon branches are automatically recorded.

You may want to annotate certain levels with things that are not automatically tracked:
* Location of any durable [[Elbereth]] retreat squares the character has prepared.
* Location of any [[Stash|stashes]] the character has created.
* Configuration of various dungeon elements that change on a game-by-game basis. For example, which shops are in Minetown (and which variant it is perhaps), if the altar there is co-aligned, etc.
* "Todos" such as floors that have not been completely explored or where there is a [[nymph]] that stole an item.
* Floors on which an unexplored [[vault]] exists.

=== Character attributes ===
Although the best way to review a character's attributes is through various means of [[enlightenment]], the character may not always have such means, particularly in the early game.

* Intrinsics the character has acquired. For example: "Has this character eaten a [[floating eye]] corpse (to gain telepathy) yet?"
* A matrix of desirable attributes ([[reflection]], [[magic cancellation]], resistances, etc.) and what gives them.

=== Events ===
* Last turn prayed, which is useful for tracking [[prayer timeout]].
* Last turn an item was invoked.
* If your [[pet]] becomes separated from you, noting the level in which this occurred may be useful, as well as the turn on which separation took place. Separated pets lose [[tameness]] the longer they are apart from their owner.

{{float right|{{caption|1=<div class="ttymap">{{dNethackMonsters}}</div>|2=Click on a glyph to go to that monster's page.}}}}

'''dNetHack''' is a NetHack variant based on [[NetHack 3.4.3]]. In addition to the usual features common to variants (e.g. new monsters, playable races, roles, and items) it introduces various novel features, including horror elements reminiscent of those found in [[Wikipedia:Call of Cthulhu (role-playing_game)|the ''Call of Cthulhu'' roleplaying game]] (based on the [[H.P. Lovecraft]] story of the same name).

== Major features ==
*New roles:
** [[Anachrononaut]]
** [[Binder (role in dNethack)|Binder]]
** [[Convict]]
** [[Madman (dNetHack role)|Madman]]
** [[Noble]]
** [[Pirate]]
** [[Bard|Troubadour]]
*Revised roles:
** [[Monk revision (dnethack)|Monk]]
*New races:
** [[Chiropteran]]
** [[Clockwork Automaton (starting race)|Clockwork Automaton]]
** [[Drow (starting race)#dNetHack|Drow]]
** [[Half-Dragon (starting race)|Half-dragon]]
** [[Incantifier (dNetHack starting race)|Incantifier]]
** [[Yuki-onna]]
** [[Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)|Vampire]]
*New skills:
** [[Musicalize spell]]
** [[Beast mastery]]
** [[User:Chris/dNethack/Lightsaber_Forms|Lightsaber forms]]
** [[Wand damage (dnethack)|Wand damage]]
*New items:
** Many new [[dNetHack artifacts|artifacts]]
** [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Changes to armor|Re-balances armors]] (As part of this, [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Rule Changes#Eating Corpses|some resistances now time out when obtained from corpses.]])
** New [[object properties#dNetHack|object properties]]: holy/unholy (which is somewhat different from blessed/cursed), sizzling, and possibly other effects. 
*Implements new [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Monsters|monsters]].
*Significant changes to [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Devil_Lords|Devil Lords]] and [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Demon_Lords|Demon Lords]]
*When reaching the levels with a Devil Lord or Demon Lord it is not always necessary to fight them.  Not all of them block the stairs.  Avoiding them may be the best course of progress in those cases.
*Re-organizes and expands the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches|dungeon]]. ([[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches/Map|ASCII-Sketch of the dungeon]])
* Replaces the Elbereth mechanic with [[Wards (dNethack)|warding signs]], [[File:Wards_dNethack.pdf]], [[User:Chris/dNetHack/WardLookup|lookup table]].

== Other features==

*[[User:Chris/dNetHack/Rule Changes|Rule changes]] ('''Some of this stuff is pretty critical to know''')

*[[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items|Items]]

*[[User:Chris/dNetHack/Conducts|Conducts in dNethack]]

*A summary of the effects of all wards can be found here: [[File:Wards_dNethack.pdf]] (spoiler).

*[[Sanity]], [[Sanity#Madnesses|Madness]], [[Insight]] spoilers

*[[Spirits_(dNetHack)|Spirits]]

*[[Cult_(dNetHack)|Cults]]

*[[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches|New/changed dungeon levels]]

== Useful pointers ==

*[[User:Chris/dNetHack/Pointers|Here are some useful pointers for experienced nethack players.]]

*[[Alignment_key_(dNethack)|How to get each of the alignment keys.]]

*[[Ascension_kit_(dNethack)|Ascension kit information for dNethack]]

*When living creatures are killed they often respawn a short time later as "zombie" versions if the corpse is left.  Zombies do higher melee damage but are slower.  If the zombie corpse remains it also may respawn.

*In the "Quest branch" for each role "genocide" is ignored.

*Converting altars can be dangerous in dNethack.  The deity of the altar may summon one or more guardians after the conversion attempt is done.

*Sokoban levels do not generate monsters in any of the boulder areas.  This means that level 1 of Sokoban is monster free (unless you bring a monster in through other means) and can be a useful place to read spellbooks or store a cache.

*The "Pokedex" entry for each monster is incredibly informative.  Checking new creatures with far-look is a good idea.  Information on the monster's attacks and resistances are generally displayed.  Additionally a [[Stethoscope]] will show the current hit points of the creature.

You arrive in the portal outside the walls of the keep. On the left side of the map are 5 hostile [[peasant]]s, 3 hostile [[soldier]]s, and 1 hostile sergeant. On the right side are 3 peaceful peasants. Your quest leader, [[old Gypsy woman|the old Gypsy woman]], is at the point marked {{white|@}}. You will need some method of crossing the moat to enter the castle.

The [[throne]] on this level is special, as it is YOUR throne. Sitting on it while wearing your quest artifact brings up a menu allowing you to chose a variety of special effects. Each effect may only be used once. They are: 
* ''Order a [[genocide]]'' (uncursed genocide) 
* ''Grant an audience'' (create some random [[pet]]s)
* ''Demand tribute'' (make a [[wish]])
* ''Use your insight'' ([[identify]] a few items from your pack).

===Upper filler levels and Locate level===
These levels are [[Mines]]-style forest levels. Each level has 4 traps, two peaceful [[Knight (player monster)|knight]]s, three peaceful peasants, and 7 random hostiles. The peaceful monsters will attack hostile monsters.

===Lower filler level(s)===
This level is a [[Mines]]-style forest level. Each level has 4 traps, one peaceful knight, and 7 random hostiles. The peaceful knight will attack hostile monsters.

The rebel leaders ({{magenta|@}}{{brightgreen|@}}{{white|@}}{{blue|@}}) can be found in the large building to the north. 16 hostile peasants, a hostile captain, lieutenant, two hostile sergeants, and 6 hostile soldiers are distributed around the map, along with 3 other monsters. The large building on the right is a cross-aligned [[Temple|shrine]]. The [[graveyard]] contains multiple [[grave]]s, but no undead or treasure ([[Vampire (starting race)|vampires]] can potentially recruit a number of followers by digging up the graves, however).

====Rebel Leadership ====
*'''Rebel Ringleader''' {{magenta|@}}[[File:Rebel_Ringleader.png]]: The [[Rebel Ringleader]] is equipped with a silver saber, gray dragon scale mail, small shield, high boots, and the quest artifact and [[Bell of Opening|silver bell]].
*'''Half-elf Ranger''' {{brightgreen|@}}[[File:Half-elf_ranger.png]]: The [[Half-elf ranger|ranger]] is equipped with 10 silver arrows, two elven short swords, an elven mithril coat, an elven leather helm, an elven cloak, high boots, and an elven bow.
*'''Militant Cleric''' {{white|@}}[[File:Militant_cleric.png]]: The [[Militant cleric|cleric]] is equipped with a mace, a set of plate mail, a large shield, and a pair of iron shoes. He casts a variety of healing magic, including mass heal, and can attack with pillars of flame.
*'''Adventuring Wizard''' {{blue|@}}[[File:Adventuring_wizard.png]]: The [[Adventuring wizard|wizard]] is equipped with a quarterstaff, a robe, a set of leather armor, and low boots. He casts magic missiles, summons elemental spheres, and can put you to sleep.

==Messages==
===Transporter level===
On descending to the level where the transporter is located:
 You receive a faint telepathic message from the old Gypsy woman:
 Your help is urgently needed at your ancestral home!
 Look for a ...ic transporter.
 You couldn't quite make out that last message.

===Entry===
First time:
 You find yourself standing in sight of your ancestral home.  You relax, anticipating 
 the comforts of home. But wait! What are those banners in the distance?
Next time:
 Once again, you return to your ancestral home.
If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again you return to your ancestral home.  You fear the rebelion may soon overwhelm
 the keep.

===Quest guardians===
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Greetings, <currentrank>.  It is good to see you again."
 "<currentrank> <playername>!  There has been an uprising amongst the peasantry!"
 "Greetings, <currentrank>.  The old Gypsy woman arived, claiming she will help us put down the
 rebellion. She is waiting in the great hall."
 "Alas, it seems as if <deity> has withdrawn from us."
 "I think the rebellion has outside aid."
If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Greetings, <currentrank>.  It is good to see you again."
 "The rebellion was easily crushed, once their leader was slain."
 "Good news, <brother|sister>!  With the rebellion quelled, your tax collectors have 
 been able to resume their work!"
 "Long live the <currentrank>!"
 "<Deity> save the <currentrank>!"

===Quest leader===
When you first meet your quest leader:
 "Ah, <playername>, my "<currentrank>."  You're a little late.  The peasant revolt has
 already swept across your lands, leaving only this keep untouched.
 The cards say you will need my help to reclaim your place. But
 I won't assist just anyone."
When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Again, you have returned.  Are you now ready to begin?"
This message is not currently used:
 "Once more, you have returned.  Are at last ready to begin?""
When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test seven times:
 "<Deity> has turned away from you, my "<currentrank>." Your faithlessness has
 cost you your ancestral home and your destiny. Flee into exile
 or end your life at the hands of the rebels.
When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Fool, only as a Boier can you hope to put down the rebellion.
 You must go out and gather further renown."
When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "Only with the full support of <deity> can you succeed.
 Go away, and don't return without the favor of <deity>."
When finally assigned the quest:
 "Yes, <currentrank>.  The cards say you are ready."
 With that, she begins drawing cards from her deck. First is
 the [[Wikipedia:The Fool (Tarot card)|zero of trumps]], followed swiftly by the [[Wikipedia:Queen of Swords|queen]] and [[Wikipedia:Seven of Swords|seven
 of swords]].
 "After you departed from your ancestral home, the Rebel Ringleader 
 and her companions broke into the keep and stole
 the Mantle of Heaven{{note|1}}, which symbolizes your right to rule
 these lands."
 The [[Wikipedia:Five of Wands|five of wands]] joins them on the table, followed by the
 [[Wikipedia:Five of Swords|five of swords]].
 "With her stolen authority, the Rebel Ringleader raised
 a peasant revolt and routed your army."
 The old Gypsy woman gathers up the cards, suffles the deck, and
 resumes drawing. Again, the first card is the zero of trumps,
 this time followed by the [[Wikipedia:Three of Wands|three]] and [[Wikipedia:Seven of Wands|seven of wands]], the
 [[Wikipedia:Queen of Swords|queen]] and [[Wikipedia:Ten of Swords|ten of swords]], and finally the [[Wikipedia:Wheel of Fortune (Tarot card)|ten of trumps]].
 "You must travel to the rebel village, slay the Rebel Ringleader,
 and recover the Mantle of Heaven{{note|1}}."
 She sits back and fixes you with a piercing stare.
 "I'd use the secret passage in your throne room to reach
 the forest, if I were you."

====Encouragement====
If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "You must learn to rely on <deity>."

 She draws a card from the center of the deck.
 It is the [[Wikipedia:Queen of Swords|queen of swords]].
 "A powerful warrior with a silver sword."

 "Why are you still here?"

 She deals a card from the bottom of the deck. It is the
 [[Wikipedia:Queen of Wands|queen of wands]].
 "A woman of nature. She fights with arrows of the moon's metal."

 "Well, what are you waiting for?"

 "Get on with it!"

 "Your surviving knights still fight the rebels in the woods."

 "There are still some loyal peasants in the woods."

 She turns over the top card. It is the [[Wikipedia:The Hierophant|five of trumps]].
 "A holy man.  He can heal his friends and set the sky on fire"

 She pulls a card from the deck: The [[Wikipedia:The Magician (Tarot card)|one of trumps]].
 "A man of magic.  At his word the elements rise up and energy
 rains down; but as any true mage knows, sleep will kill you
 faster than flames!"

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 You remember the directions to the rebel village, given to you
 by the the old Gypsy woman.  You are on the right path.
When returning:
 Again, you approach the rebel village.
When first entering the goal level:
 You have found the rebel village.
 The rebel leaders will be in  one of the houses.
When returning:
 Again, you have invaded the Rebel Ringleader's stronghold.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So, at last you have come. Your death shall set this land free!"
Upon further meetings:
 "So, <currentrank>.  You are a fool to return here."
And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "Die, <currentrank>!"
When you have the Mantle of Heaven/Vestment of Hell, but the Rebel Ringleader has not been destroyed:
 "You have no right to the Mantle of Heaven{{note|1}}!"

====Discouragement====
The Rebel Ringleader will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "Run away, <Nobleman|Noblewoman>, and keep your life."
 "You are no match for us, <Nobleman|Noblewoman>."
 "Turn to dust!"
 "<deity> won't help you."
 "You shall oppress us no more!
 "You will die here, <currentrank> <Nobleman|Noblewoman>"
 "You cannot defeat me, for I have justice on my side."
 "Monster!"
 "I powers have failed you, <currentrank>."
 "Without the Mantle of Heaven{{note|1}}, you have no claim over us!"

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you pick up the Mantle of Heaven{{note|1}}, you feel connected to your land and your people
 for the first time since returning to your ancestral home.
 You feel you should hury back to the keep and take up your throne
 once again, if just for a short time.
When destroying the nemesis:
 The Rebel Ringleader sinks to her knees, coughing blood. She gasps:
  "Bastard. You may kill me, but you can't kill justice!
  The rebellion is greater than any one person. These people shall
  be free of your tyrany yet!"
 The Rebel Ringleader is silent after that, but you remain prudently out of arm's reach
 until you are certain she has bled out.
When returning to your quest leader:
 "You have returned, <currentrank>.  And regained the Mantle of Heaven{{note|1}}, no less."
 She flicks a card from her deck, and when it lands at your feet you
 see that it is [[Wikipedia:The Devil (Tarot card)|fifteenth trump]].
 "Isn't your own quest yet unfinished?"
When subsequently throwing the Mantle of Heaven/Vestment of Hell to the old Gypsy woman:
 The old Gypsy woman studies the Mantle of Heaven{{note|1}} for a moment,
 then turns to glare at to you.
 "How cruel you are to taunt an old woman. My curse, the curse of
 all my kin, prevents me from ever finding a home of my own."

===Post-Quest===
When talking to the old Gypsy woman after the quest:
 "Why are you back!?  There is nothing left to be done here!"
When talking to the old Gypsy woman after getting the [[the Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 The old Gypsy woman holds up the last two cards in her deck: the [[Wikipedia:The High Priestess|two]] and [[Wikipedia:The World (Tarot card)|twenty-one
 of trumps]].
 "You have one task remaining. It begins where you entered."

The '''Warrior''' is a [[role]] that appears in ''[[SlashTHEM]]''. They are a pure fighting-class similar to the [[Knight]], and can be any race or alignment.

A Warrior will gain [[Speed]] at level 7, but doesn't learn techniques by leveling up (unless their race grants them).

The [[Warrior quest]] sees you fighting [[Archnemesis]] for [[The Magic Mirror of Jason]].

The Warrior's starting pet is a [[green nightmare]] that starts out with a saddle. However, unlike the [[Knight]], a Warrior's riding skill starts out Unskilled, preventing the player from picking up items while riding unless the skill is advanced to Basic.

==Starting Equipment==

* +1 [[mace]]
* +1 [[crossbow]]
* 50 blessed +0 [[crossbow bolt]]s
* +0 [[large shield]]
* a random amount of [[carrot]]s and [[apple]]s

And one of the following (5% chance each):

* plate mail
* plasteel armor
* crystal plate mail
* bronze plate mail
* splint mail
* banded mail
* chain mail
* scale mail
* ring mail
* yellow dragon scales
* red dragon scales
* blue dragon scales
* green dragon scales
* white dragon scales
* shimmering dragon scales
* deep dragon scales
* black dragon scales
* orange dragon scales
* silver dragon scales
* gray dragon scales

== Intrinsics ==

Warriors gain intrinsics at these [[experience level]]s:

* XL 7 : [[Speed]]

==Warrior rank titles==

The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1-2: Swordsman
*XL 3-5: Longswordsman
*XL 6-9: Two-Handed Swordsman
*XL 10-13: Legionnaire
*XL 14-17: Crusader
*XL 18-21: Baron/ess
*XL 22-25: Count/ess
*XL 26-29: Duke/Duchess
*XL 30: Patriarch/Matriarch

==Strategy==
The Warrior is a combat-oriented role. His high physical stats allow him to fight in melee most of the time while also allowing him to use a variety of ranged weapons. However, the complete lack of any spellcasting skills means the Warrior will have difficulty casting higher-level spells. They also don't get a lot of useful intrinsics or techniques by leveling up.

The Warrior's quest artifact, [[The Magic Mirror of Jason]], is extremely hard to obtain thanks to the quest nemesis' difficulty; basically, the quest forces the Warrior to fight a beefed-up version of [[Master Kaen]].

Being a [[drow]] can aid in the Warrior's melee fighting abilities, and a [[vampire]] Warrior can deal extra damage by feeding on enemies.

==Origin==
The Warrior is based on the Gauntlet role with the same name. If the Warrior is weak from hunger, the game will display "Warrior needs food, badly!", which is a reference to Gauntlet's low health warning.

The ogro is a playable race that starts with a [[club]] in their inventory in addition to whatever the player's role usually starts with. They can be any role and alignment. An ogro learns [[techniques]] by leveling up: they start out with [[missile flurry]], and they get [[berserk]] at XL 10, [[primal roar]] at XL 15 and [[critical strike]] at XL 20. Ogro characters also start with uncurable [[aggravate monster]] and are prevented from getting [[stealth]].

== Strategy ==

Apart from their techniques, ogro characters aren't that great. Their intrinsic aggravate monster means they will have to fight more often, but they may use their techniques for melee and ranged combat to increase their chances of survival.

Any ogres that are randomly spawned will be peaceful for an ogro character. There is no penalty for eating them either.

The trollor (subspecies of [[troll]]) is a playable race specific to [[Slash'EM Extended]]. They can be any role and alignment, and they start with intrinsic [[sickness resistance]] and [[regeneration]] but cannot have [[fire resistance]]. If a trollor dies and is at least [[experience level]] 3, there is a 75% chance of reviving (similar to the [[life saving]] effect), but this will [[level drain|drain]] two character levels.
Their maximum stats are as follows:

{|class="prettytable"
!Character<br />[[Race]]
!Strength
!Dexterity
!Constitution
!Intelligence
!Wisdom
!Charisma
|-
|[[Trollor]]
|25
|25
|25
|25
|25
|25
|}

== Strategy ==

Trollor characters are hard to kill thanks to regeneration and their ability to "cheat death" by reviving. However, they will take a significant hit to their maximum [[hit points]] and [[energy]] in the process, making it easier for monsters to kill them again, and there is always a 25% risk of the revival effect failing. Also, a trollor will get next to no hit points or energy on leveling up, so they may want to do some [[nurse dancing]], eat lots of [[newt]] corpses and quaff [[potions]] that increase their max values.

Having an [[amulet of life saving]] is very useful as a trollor, because the 75% chance of auto-reviving gets checked prior to the AOLS check. So if the player auto-revives, the amulet will still be there, allowing the player to die again at least once without ending the game.

Using a blessed genocide on T will [[instadeath|instantly]] [[YASD|kill]] a trollor character, with no chance of reviving.

The '''Electric Mage''' is a [[role]] specific to ''[[SlashTHEM]]''. They are a spellcaster class, and can be any race or alignment.

An Electric Mage starts the game with equipment and abilities related to lightning magic, including [[shock resistance]]. Their starting pet is a [[shock hound pup]].

The [[Electric Mage quest]] sees you fighting the ghost of [[Elvis Presley]] for the [[Thunder Whistle]].

*XL 14-17: Energic
*XL 18-21: Arclite
*XL 22-25: Volt Technician
*XL 26-29: Thundermage
*XL 30: Shock-Master

==Strategy==
The Electric Mage is a battlemage similar to the flame/ice mage, with the main difference being that they specialize in lightning magic. Their starting pet is also shock resistant, making it much safer to use lightning spells/wands. Upon leveling up enough, the shock hound pup will grow into an adult shock hound which is very strong and capable of taking down lots of enemies.

The [[Electric Mage quest]] mainly spawns [[shoggoth]]s and [[blob]]s, and the player may suffer from [[acid]] damage quite often. Their quest nemesis, the [[ghost]] of [[Elvis Presley]], isn't too hard to take out.

==Origin==
The Electric Mage is a lightning-based pendant to [[SLASH'EM]]'s [[flame mage|flame]] and [[ice mage]]s.

The '''Noble''' is a role added in the Noble Role patch, which was implemented for [[dNetHack]].

Nobles are a melee-focused role that specializes in one-handed weapons. They can engage in some spellcasting if their ability scores are good enough.

They can be [[Human_(starting_race)|Humans]], [[Incantifier_(starting_race)|Incantifiers]], [[Vampire_(starting_race)|Vampires]], [[Elf_(starting_race)|Elves]], [[Drow_(starting_race)|Drow]], or [[Dwarf_(starting_race)|Dwarves]].  In this variant many races receive race-specific quests, artifacts, equipment, and skill lists for this role.

== dNethack Human, Vampire, and Incantifier Noble ==

This was the first set of races to be implemented, and is therefore the 'default' Noble configuration. This configuration is essentially the Vampire racial configuration, and is very (very very) loosely based on the classic [[Wikipedia:Ravenloft (module)|Ravenloft]] D&D module.

The Noble's [[special spell]] is [[spellbook of protection|protection]]. Spell success is determined by [[intelligence]]. 

===Starting Pet===

The starting pet is a saddled [[pony]].

===Starting Equipment===
*+2 [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Rapier|rapier]]
*''Noblemen'': [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Ruffled_Shirt|ruffled shirt]]
*''Noblewomen'': [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Victorian_Underwear|Victorian underwear]]
*+1 [[leather gloves]]
*+1 [[leather cloak]]
*A random [[ring]]
*[[Apple]]s
*[[Food ration]]s

===Artifacts===
====First Gift: Rod of Lordly Might====
The Rod grants +1d3 to-hit, 2x damage, and can be invoked for a variety of effects.
*'''At will''': The Rod can be ordered to assume a different form as often as desired.
**Become Mace
**Become Axe
**Become Rapier
**Become Spear
**Become Lance
**Fast engraving: the Rod engraves as an [[athame]].
*'''Limited''': these powers are limited by the artifact's invoke cooldown. Once you invoke one of them, you can't invoke any of these powers for <code>[[rnz]](100)</code> turns.
**Become Ladder (Rod must be a mace):
***''Before gaining the amulet'': Similar to quaffing a cursed potion of [[gain level]], allows you to escape through the ceiling to the level above.
***''After gaining the amulet'': Similar to zapping a [[wand of digging]] downward, allows you to escape through the floor to the level below.
***''While swallowed'': Similar to zapping a [[wand of digging]], the extending ladder seriously injures physical monsters engulfing you.
**Show me my surroundings: Maps local area using [[clairvoyance]].
**Inspire Fear: Scares nearby monsters that can see you.
**Give me your life (Rod must be a spear): Drains two levels from one adjacent monster, healing you for 4d8 hp.
**Kneel: Paralyzes one adjacent monster.

====Quest Artifact (non-vampire): Mantle of Heaven====
The Mantle of Heaven is an artifact [[ornamental cope]] that grants [[cold resistance]] when carried. When worn, it also grants [[shock resistance ]], [[half spell damage]], and double the AC bonus of a non-artifact ornamental cope. As an [[ornamental cope]], its base item type varies from game to game. If found in a [[bones file]], it will be [[lawful]]
====Quest Artifact (vampire): Vestment of Hell====
The Vestment of Hell is an artifact [[opera cloak]] that grants [[fire resistance]] when carried. When worn, it also grants [[acid resistance]], [[half physical damage]], and double the AC bonus of a non-artifact opera cloak. As an [[opera cloak]], its base item type varies from game to game. If found in a [[bones file]], it will be [[chaotic]].

==== Crowning Artifact (Lawful or Neutral Non-vampire): The Crown of the Saint King ====
The Crown of the Saint King is an artifact [[gold circlet]] that causes all pets on a dungeon level to follow you when traveling between dungeon levels (normally, only adjacent pets will follow you between levels).  When invoked, it shows the location of all pets on the current level, and increases their tameness.  This can be useful for keeping [[inediate]] pets tame. As a gold circlet, its base item type varies from game to game, it may even be a [[Helm of opposite alignment]].  As with all gold circlets, it increases your [[charisma]] score by its enchantment bonus when worn.  It can be safely enchanted at +5 or below, meaning it can safely reach +7.

==== Crowning Artifact (Vampire or Chaotic Non-vampire): The Helm of the Dark Lord ====
The Helm of the Dark Lord is an artifact [[visored helmet]] that causes all pets on a dungeon level to follow you when traveling between dungeon levels (normally, only adjacent pets will follow you between levels).  When invoked, it shows the location of all pets on the current level, and increases their tameness.  This can be useful for keeping [[inediate]] pets tame. As a visored helm, its base item type varies from game to game, it may even be a [[Helm of opposite alignment]].  As with all visored helms, it protects your eyes from the blinding attacks of [[Raven]]s.  It can be safely enchanted at +5 or below, meaning it can safely reach +7.

===Quest===
The [[Noble quest]] sees the Noble returning to their ancestral keep to put down a peasant revolt, by recovering their stolen quest artifact. 

===Gods===
