 side of a hill.  From within, you smell the foul stench of carrion.
 The pools on either side of the entrance are fouled with blood, and
 pieces of rusted metal and broken weapons show above the surface.

When returning:

 Again, you stand at the entrance to Ixoth's lair.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the [[quest nemesis]]:

 "Hah!  Another puny Knight seeks death.  I shall dine well tonight,
 then tomorrow, Camelot Castle shall fall!"

Upon further meetings:

 "Again, thou challengest me, <currentrank>?  So be it.  Thou wilt die here."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "Thou art truly foolish, <currentrank>.  I shall dispatch thee anon."

When you have the Magic Mirror of Merlin, but Ixoth is still alive:

 "So, thou darest touch MY property!  I shall have that bauble back,
 puny <currentrank>.  Thou wilt die in agony!"

====Discouragement====
[[Ixoth]] will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "A mere <currentrank> can never withstand me!"
 "I shall kill thee now, and feast!"
 "Puny Knight.  What manner of death dost thou wish?"
 "First thee, <playername>, then I shall feast upon King Arthur."
 "Hah!  Thou hast failed, <currentrank>.  Now thou shalt die."
 "Die, Knight.  Thou art as nothing against my might."
 "I shall suck the marrow from thy bones, Knight."
 "Let's see...  Broiled?  No.  Fried?  Nay.  Baked?  Yea verily,
 that is the way I like my Knight for dinner."
 "Thy strength waneth, <playername>.  The time of thy death draweth near."
 "Call upon thy precious Lugh, <playername>.  It shall not avail thee."

===Victory===
When picking up your [[quest artifact]]:

 As you pick up the Magic Mirror of Merlin, you feel its protective fields
 form around your body.  You also feel a faint stirring in your mind,
 as if you are in two places at once, and in the second, you are waking
 from a long sleep.

When killing the nemesis:

 As Ixoth sinks to the ground, blood gushing from his open mouth, he
 defiantly curses you and King Arthur:
     Thou hast not won yet, <currentrank>.  By the gods, I shall return and dog
     thy steps to the grave!
 His tail flailing madly, Ixoth tries to crawl towards you, but slumps
 to the ground and dies in a pool of his own blood.

When returning to your quest leader:

 As you approach King Arthur, he beams at you and says:
     Well done!  Thou art truly the Champion of Camelot Castle.  We
     have received word that Merlin is recovering, and shall soon
     rejoin Us.    
     He hath instructed Us that thou art now to be the guardian of
     the Magic Mirror of Merlin.  He feeleth that thou mayst have need of
     its powers in thine adventures.  It is Our wish that thou keepest
     the Magic Mirror of Merlin with thee as thou searchest for the fabled
     Amulet of Yendor.

When subsequently throwing the Magic Mirror of Merlin to King Arthur:

 "Careful, <playername>!  The Magic Mirror of Merlin might break, and that would
 be a tragic loss.  Thou art its keeper now, and the time hath come
 to resume thy search for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await thy
 return through the magic portal that brought thee here."

===Post-quest===
When talking to [[King Arthur]] after the quest:

 "Well met, <playername>.  How goeth thy search for the Amulet of Yendor?"

When talking to King Arthur after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:

 "Thou hast succeeded, We see, <playername>!  Now thou art commanded to take
 the Amulet to be sacrificed to Lugh in the plane of the astral.
 "Merlin hath counseled Us that thou must travel always upwards through
 the planes of the elements, to achieve this goal.
== Strategy ==
The Knight [[player monster]]s in the home level can generate with a variety of useful scrolls, potions, and wands, as well as a well-enchanted longsword for twoweaponing. A powerful [[pet]] should be able to kill them, although the Knights have strong attacks and might be able to kill your pet instead. Killing the Knights yourself is [[murder]], and could make King Arthur hostile if he's in line of sight, making the game [[unwinnable]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|King Arthur is now guaranteed to have Excalibur, if it does not already exist.  While most Knights will already have [[dip]]ped for Excalibur long before the Quest, any Knight who does not already have it should consider creating it before reaching levels that can have the Quest portal.}}

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 What sorcery has brought you back to the Temple of Epidaurus?  The smell
 of fresh funeral pyres tells you that something is amiss with the healing
 powers that used to practice here.
 No rhizotomists are tending the materia medica gardens, and where are the
 common folk who used to come for the cures?
 You know that you must quickly make your way to the collegium, and
 Hippocrates' iatreion, and find out what has happened in your
 absence.

Next time:
 After your last experience you expected to be here, but you certainly
 did not expect to see things so much worse.  This time you must
 succeed.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again, you <see|sense> the Temple of Epidaurus in the distance.
 The smell of death and disease permeates the air.  You do not have
 to be a Medicus ossium to know that the Cyclops is on the verge of victory.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Did you read that new treatise on the therapeutic use of leeches?"
 "Paint a red caduceus on your shield and monsters won't hit you."
 "I passed handwriting so they are demoting me a rank."
 "I've heard that even Hippocrates has not been able to cure Chiron."
 "We think the Cyclops has used his alchemists, and the Staff of Aesculapius,
 to unleash a new disease we call 'the cold' on Gehennom."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Did you read that new treatise on the therapeutic use of leeches?"
 "Paint a red caduceus on your shield and monsters won't hit you."
 "How are you feeling?  Perhaps a good bleeding will improve your sprits."
 "Have you heard the absurd new theory that diseases are caused by
 microscopic organisms, and not ill humors?"
 "I see that you bring the Staff of Aesculapius, now you can cure this plague!"

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 Feebly, Hippocrates raises his head to look at you.
 "It is good to see you again, <playername>.  I see the concern in your
 eyes, but do not worry for me.  I am not ready for Hades yet.  We have
 exhausted much of our healing powers holding off the Cyclops.
 I need your fresh strength to carry on our work.
 "Come closer and let me lay hands on you, and determine if you have
 the skills necessary to accomplish this mission."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Again you return to me, <playername>.  I sense that each trip back
 the pleurisy and maladies of our land begin to infect you.  Let us
 hope and pray to Hermes that you become ready for your task before
 you fall victim to the bad humors."

This message is not currently used:

 "Chiron has fallen, Hermes has fallen, what else must I tell you to
 impress upon you the importance of your mission!  I hope that you
 have come prepared this time."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "You have failed us, <playername>.  You are a quack!  A charlatan!
 "Hades will be happy to hear that you are once again practicing your
 arts on the unsuspecting."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Alas, <playername>, you are yet too inexperienced to deal with the rigors
 of such a task.  You must be able to draw on the knowledge of botany,
 vetenary, and alchemy before I can send you on this quest with good
 conscience.
 "Return when you wear a Medicus ossium's caduceus."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "You have learned much of the remedies that benefit, but you must also
 know which physic for which ail.  That is why Hermes' teachings are a
 part of your training.
 "Return to us when you have healed thyself."

When finally assigned the quest:

 For the first time, you sense a smile on Hippocrates' face.
     You have indeed learned as much as we can teach you in preparation
     for this task.  Let me tell you what I know of the symptoms and hope
     that you can provide a cure.
     A short while ago, the dreaded Cyclops was fooled by the gods
     into thinking that he could use the Staff of Aesculapius to find a
     cure for old age.  Think of it, eternal youth!  But his good
     health is accomplished by drawing the health from those around him.
     He has exhausted his own supply of healthy people and now he seeks to
     extend his influence into our world.  You must recover from him
     %o and break the spell.
     You must travel into the swamps to the Temple of Coeus, and from there
     follow the trail to the Cyclops' island lair.  Be careful.

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "Remember, <playername>, to always wash your hands before operating."
 "The Cyclops has no real magic of his own.  To this he is vulnerable."
 "If you have been true to Hermes, you can draw on the power of
 the Staff of Aesculapius."
 "Bring with you antidotes for poisons."
 "Remember this, the Cyclops can twist the powers of the Staff of Aesculapius
 to hurt instead of heal."
 "I have sent for Chiron, but I am afraid he will come too late."
 "Maybe when you return the snakes will once again begin to shed."
 "The plague grows worse as we speak.  Hurry, <playername>!"
 "Many times the Cyclops has caused trouble in these lands.  It is
 time that he was eradicated like the diseases he has caused."
 "With but one eye, the Cyclops should be easy to blind.  Remember this."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:

 You stand before the entrance to the Temple of Coeus.  Strange
 scratching noises come from within the building.
 The swampy ground around you seems to stink with disease.

When returning:

 Once again you stand at the entrance to the Temple of Coeus.

When first entering the goal level:

 You stand within sight of the infamous Isle of the Cyclops.  Even
 the words of Hippocrates had not prepared you for this.
 Steeling yourself against the wails of the ill that pierce your ears,
 you hurry on your task.  Maybe with the Staff of Aesculapius you can
 heal them on your return, but not now.

When returning:

 Once again, you <see|sense> the Isle of the Cyclops in the distance.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "They have made a mistake in sending you, <playername>.
 "When I add your youth to mine, it will just make it easier for me
 to defeat Hippocrates."

Upon further meetings:

 "Unlike your patients, you seem to keep coming back, <playername>!"

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "Which would you like, <playername>?  Boils, pleurisy, convulsions?"

When you have the Staff of Aesculapius, but the Cyclops is still alive:

 "I'll have the Staff of Aesculapius back from you, <currentrank>.  You are
 not going to live to escape this place."

====Discouragement====

The Cyclops will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "They might as well give scalpels to wizards as to let you try to
 use the Staff of Aesculapius!"
 "If I could strike Hippocrates, surrounded by his attendants, imagine what I
 can do to you here by yourself."
 "I will put my Medicus ossiums to work making a physic out of your ashes."
 "As we speak, Hades gathers your patients to join you."
 "After I'm done with you, I'll destroy Hippocrates as well."
 "You will have to kill me if you ever hope to leave this place."
 "I will impale your head on my caduceus for all to see."
 "There is no materia medica in your sack which will cure you of me!"
 "Do not fight too hard, I want your soul strong, not weakened!"
 "You should have stopped studying at vetenary."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Staff of Aesculapius, you feel its healing begin to
 warm your soul.  You curse Zeus for taking it from its rightful owner,
 but at least you hope that Hippocrates can put it to good use once
 again.

When killing the nemesis:

 The battered body of the Cyclops slumps to the ground and gasps
 out one last curse:
     You have defeated me, <playername>, but I shall have my revenge.
     How, I shall not say, but this curse shall be like a
     cancer on you.
 With that the Cyclops dies.

When returning to your quest leader:
 As soon as Hippocrates sees the Staff of Aesculapius he summons his attendants.
 Gently, Hippocrates reaches out and touches the Staff of Aesculapius.
 He instructs each of the assembled to do the same.  When everyone
 has finished he speaks to you.
     Now that we have been replenished we can defeat this plague.  You must
     take the Staff of Aesculapius with you and replenish the worlds you have
     been called upon to travel next.  I wish you could ride Chiron to the
     end of your journey, but I need him to help me spread the cure.  Go
     now and continue your journey.

When subsequently throwing the Staff of Aesculapius to Hippocrates:
 Hippocrates cautiously handles the Staff of Aesculapius while watching you.
 "You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
 for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the
 magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Hippocrates after the quest:
 "You have again returned to us, <playername>.  We have done well in your
 absence, yes?  How fare you upon your quest for the Amulet?"

When talking to Hippocrates after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Ah, you have recovered the Amulet, <playername>.  Well done!
 "Now, you should know that you must travel through the elemental planes
 to the astral, and there return the Amulet to Hermes.  Go forth and
 may our prayers be as a wind upon your back."

== Strategy ==
[[Reflection]] is strongly recommended, as you're unlikely to have resistances to all the different types of dragon breath you'll encounter on the Quest. You'll also need a safe way to deal with the eels, such as a [[polearm]] or [[oilskin cloak]].

If you don't have a source of [[levitation]] or [[water walking boots]], you can still traverse the home level by evaporating pools with a [[wand of fire]], or luring a [[red dragon]] into breathing in the right direction. You can then walk to the temple through the resulting pits. A [[wand of cold]] or [[white dragon]] can freeze the pools, but the ice is likely to melt eventually.

Try not to kill the dragons over water if you can avoid it; they carry many valuable scrolls, potions, and wands, and are likely to supply gray or silver [[dragon scales]] to turn into mail without the need to spend a wish on it.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 Waves of blistering heat ripple off of the lava-covered landscape that
 surrounds you.  Off in the distance, you can see the craggy rocks
 of the great Circle of Flame.
 Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect a faint hint of
 evil moisture in the air.

Next time:
 Once again, you near the great Circle of Flame.  You know that the High Flame Mage
 will be waiting.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
 the great Circle of Flame.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood has boiled away!"
 "May your days always be warm!"
 "We have had trouble concentrating on our studies!"
 "The water elementals are fierce, but they boil away under our fire!"
 "The High Flame Mage is a strange one, but he has helped defend us."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood has boiled away!"
 "May your days always be warm!"
 "Since the defeat of the hoarde (sic), all can concentrate fully on our studies!"
 "I'm taking my holidays in Gehennom this year - very warm there, supposedly"
 "Have you noticed how much stronger the High Flame Mage is since the Candle of  Eternal Flame was recovered?"

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 "Ah, <playername>.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
 need of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.
 "But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "<playername>, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"

This message is not currently used:

 "Again, you stand before me, <playername>.  Surely you have prepared yourself."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, <player>.  You will never attain
 the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
 closed this future to you.
 "I will protect these people as best I can, but soon the Water Mage will overcome
 me and destroy all who once called you <brother|sister>.  Now begone!"

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "<playername>, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
 the Water Mage.  Only a Torcher with the help of <deity> could ever hope to
 defeat him."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "<playername>!  You have wandered from the path of the <alignment>!
 If you attempt to overcome the Water Mage in this state, he will surely
 enslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
 Go forth, and return when you feel ready."

When finally assigned the quest:

 "The world is in great need of your assistance, <playername>.
 "About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
 as the Water Mage, had begun to summon horrible elementals from the plane of
 Water.
 "The Water Mage and his hordes of elementals swept down upon the great Circle of Flame and stole 
 the Candle of Eternal Flame, and seeks to bend it to his will.
 After many brave wizards were slain by his watery servants, I
 sent forth a summons for you!
 "If the Water Mage can bend the Candle of Eternal Flame to his will, he will become
 almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave our elementals, 
 and destroy us.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
 and with <deity> behind you, you alone can defeat the Water Mage.
 "You must go to the Water Mage's Cave.  From there, you can track down
 the Water Mage, defeat him, and return the Candle of Eternal Flame to us.  Only
 then will the world be safe."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "The Water Mage is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
 "Remember that the Water Mage is a great sorcerer.  He lived in the time
 of Atlantis."
 "If you fail, <playername>, I will not be able to protect these people long."
 "To enter the Water Mage's Cave, you must be very stealthy.  The elementals will be on guard."
 "Call upon <deity> in your time of need."
 "May <deity> protect you, and guide your steps."
 "If you can lay hands upon the Candle of Eternal Flames, carry it for good fortune."
 "I cannot stand against the Water Mage's sorcery.  But <deity> will help you."
 "Do not fear the Water Mage. I know you can defeat him."
 "You have a great road to travel, <playername>, but only after you defeat
 the Water Mage."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:

 The soggy scent of water comes to you in the breeze.  You know that
 you have located the Water Mage's Cave.

When returning:

 Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate the Water Mage's Cave.

When first entering the goal level:

 The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
 very air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
 make you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of the Water Mage.

When returning:

 Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer the High Flame Mage sends to do his bidding.
 I have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.
 "Prepare to die, Flame Mage."

Upon further meetings:

 "I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "You return yet again, Flame Mage!  Are you prepared for death now?"

When you have the Candle of Eternal Flame, but the Water Mage is still alive:

 "I shall have the Candle of Eternal Flame back, you pitiful excuse for a 
 Flame Mage.
 And your life as well."

====Discouragement====

The Water Mage will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
 "You are a sorry excuse for a <currentrank>."
 "Run while you can, Flame Mage.  My next spell will be your last."
 "I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
 "<deity> cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
 "Your <alignment> nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
 "Come, Barbarian.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your people."
 "Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off the High Flame Mage, and your people."
 "Fight, Flame Mage, or are you afraid of the mighty Water Mage?"
 "You have failed, Flame Mage.  Now, my victory is complete."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Candle of Eternal Flame, you feel the power of it
 flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
 at once, even though you are holding it.

When killing the nemesis:

 The Water Mage falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then his
 body fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
 slowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
 begun to fade.

When returning to your quest leader:

 When the High Flame Mage sees the Candle of Eternal Flame, he smiles, and says:
     Well done, <playername>.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
     What, now, should be done with the Candle of Eternal Flame?
     These wizards, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
     other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as the Water Mage did.
     Take the Candle of Eternal Flame with you, <playername>.  It will guard you in
     your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
     quest far greater than you realize.
     Remember me, <playername>, and return when you have triumphed.  I
     will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
     time comes.

When subsequently throwing the Candle of Eternal Flame to the High Flame Mage:

 The High Flame Mage gazes at the Candle of Eternal Flame warmly for a moment, then back at you.
 "You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
 for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the
 magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to the High Flame Mage after the quest:

 "Tell us, <playername>, have you fared well on your great quest?"

When talking to the High Flame Mage after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:

 "This is wondrous, <playername>.  I feared that you could not possibly
 succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
 of Yendor!
 "I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
 the Book of Skelos, I found this:
     <deity> will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
     be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for <deity> has willed it so.
     It is said that the child of <deity> will recover the Amulet of Yendor
     that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.
 "As you now possess the amulet, <playername>, I suspect that the Book
 speaks of you.
     The child of <deity> will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
     Plane, where the Great Temple of <deity> is to be found.  The Amulet
     will be sacrificed to <deity>, there on His altar.  Then the child will
     stand by <deity> as champion of all Flame Mages for eternity.
 "This is all I know, <playername>.  I hope it will help you."

Every level of the Priest quest is considered a [[graveyard]] level, regardless of whether it contains a graveyard, meaning [[undead]] monsters are less likely to leave corpses.

The two-way magic portal back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point to top left. Each floor space in the 11 leftmost and rightmost columns (marked in green above), other than the portal, has a 10% chance of being a [[tree]]. The room with the unaligned altar is a desecrated temple lacking its aligned priest; the Arch Priest is next to the altar, and eight acolytes inhabit the room. There are twelve human zombies surrounding the Temple. In addition to the two marked dart traps inside the doors, there are four random other traps on the level.

The level is no-teleport and has an undiggable floor; the walls are also undiggable, but trees may be chopped down.

===Upper filler level===

This is an "ordinary" room-and-corridor level, with six rooms (two of which are graveyards). In addition to the usual undead and boxes in the graveyards, the level contains two human zombies and one wraith; nine random objects; and four random traps.

===The Temple of Nalzok===

The above core of the level is surrounded by empty ground, containing the upstair a little way to the right of the mapped area. The unaligned [[temple]] has both its [[aligned priest|attendant priest of Moloch]], and another hostile priest nearby; fighting the hostile priest will not anger the peaceful one. The entire mapped area outside the temple is a [[graveyard]], filled with the usual assortment of undead. In addition to the boxes of the graveyard, the four corner chambers of the temple each contain four random objects (except the northwestern corner, which contains 3); each also contains a marked random trap, and there are two other random traps located in the mapped area. The entire level has undiggable walls and floor. Teleportation is permitted.

===Lower filler level(s)===

These are "ordinary" room-and-corridor levels, with six rooms (three of which are graveyards). In addition to the usual undead and boxes in the graveyard, each level contains three human zombies and three wraiths; eleven random objects; and four random traps.

The above core of the level is surrounded by empty lava plain. [[Nalzok]], with the [[Bell of Opening]] and the [[Mitre of Holiness]], is at one of the two points marked {{msl|Nalzok}} (randomly chosen); also in the mapped area are sixteen human zombies, eight wraiths, two random {{monclasssym|Z}}, and one random {{monclasssym|W}}; fourteen random objects; four fire traps, and two other random traps. Teleportation is permitted.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You find yourself standing in sight of the Great Temple.  Something
 is obviously wrong here.  The doors to the Great Temple, which usually
 stand open, are closed.  Strange human shapes shamble around
 outside.
 You realize that the Arch Priest needs your assistance!

Next time:
 Once again, you stand before the Great Temple.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again you face the Great Temple.  Your intuition hints that this may be
 the final time you come here.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Greetings, honored <currentrank>.  It is good to see you."
 "Ah, <playername>!  Surely you can help us in our hour of need."
 "Greetings, <brother|sister>.  The Arch Priest has great need of your help."
 "Alas, it seems as if even <deity> has deserted us."
 "May <deity> be with you, <brother|sister>."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Greetings, <currentrank>.  It is good to see you again."
 "Ah, <playername>!  Our deepest gratitude for all of your help."
 "Welcome back, <brother|sister>!  With the Mitre of Holiness, no undead can stand against us."
 "Praise be to <deity>, for delivering us from Nalzok."
 "May <deity> be with you, <brother|sister>."

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 "Ah, <playername>, my <son|daughter>.  You have returned to us at last.
 A great blow has befallen our order; perhaps you can help us.
 First, however, I must determine if you are prepared for this
 great challenge."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Again, my <son|daughter>, you stand before me.  Are you ready now to help us?"

This message is not currently used:

 "Once more, <playername>, you stand within the sanctum.  Are you ready now?"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "You are a heretic, <playername>!  How can you, a <currentrank>, deviate so from the
 teachings of <deity>?  Begone from this temple.  You are no longer
 a <brother|sister> to this order.  We will pray to <deity> for other assistance,
 as you have failed us utterly."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Alas, <playername>, it is not yet to be.  A mere <currentrank> could never
 withstand the might of Nalzok.  Go forth, again into the world, and return
 when you have attained the post of Curate."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "This is terrible, <playername>.  You have deviated from the true path!
 You know that <deity> requires the most strident devotion of this
 order.  The <brother|sister>hood must stand for utmost piety.
 "Go from here, atone for your sins against <deity>.  Return only when
 you have purified yourself."

When finally assigned the quest:

 "Yes, <playername>.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
 tell you of what has transpired:
 "At one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, Nalzok and a legion
 of undead invaded the Great Temple.  Many acolytes were killed, including
 the one carrying the Mitre of Holiness.
 "As a final act of vengefulness, Nalzok desecrated the altar here.
 Without it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
 barely enough acolytes left to keep the undead at bay.
