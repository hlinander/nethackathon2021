'''Death by Boredom''' is an all too common problem among many players. You get frustrated playing along slowly and decide "It's probably ok to hold down '''.''''' ''or ''',''' for a hundred or so turns while my power comes back." And then you get killed by a newt, robbed of your +7 Stormbringer/Grayswandir by a nymph, or have your pet dragon get confused from hunger and turn on you.

In [[SLASH'EM]] the hydra is one of two non-dragons to use the {{white|D}} glyph, the other being the [[wyvern]].  True to its source mythos, it has a large number of bite attacks.  It cannot, however, grow new heads when attacked with a sword.

===Strategy===
These should not pose a problem by the time one encounters them; they are somewhat slow, do only a moderate amount of damage, and have no particular special attacks.  They do have a large amount of hit points and a decent AC, though, in addition to resisting stoning.

== SpliceHack ==
In [[SpliceHack]] the hydra uses the {{white|:}} glyph and can grow new heads.

==Mythos==

The hydra is of course the monster from Greek mythology. It's full name being the Lernaean Hydra (Λερναῖα Ὕδρα). It is a  large, snake-like monster, with multiple heads, that Heracles fought, which would grow two new heads for every one chopped off.

It may also be a reference to the [http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Hydra same monster] in [[Linley's Dungeon Crawl|Crawl]], which also uses the {{brightgreen|D}} glyph.  It is one of the more notable monsters in Crawl, as it does have the ability to regrow heads, and will do so whenever attacked with a non-flaming edged weapon.

A wyvern is one of two dragon-like monsters to use the {{white|D}} glyph in [[SLASH'EM]], the other being the [[hydra]]. It possesses a [[poisonous]] sting, but no breath weapon.

==Strategy==
Wyverns are an exception to the general rule that SLASH'EM's new monsters tend to be more dangerous than their vanilla counterparts.  As compared to normal dragons, this is a relatively weak monster. The poison component of its attack is rendered mostly harmless by [[magic cancellation|MC 3]], and completely so by [[poison resistance]]. By the time one encounters wyverns, one should almost certainly have at least one, if not both, of these properties. Since they have no breath attack, they are thus less of a threat than normal dragons.

==Mythology==
A wyvern is a dragon-like creature from English mythology that possesses only two legs (sometimes none) and a barbed tail, unlike most depictions of dragons.

A leprechaun wizard is a stronger, spellcasting leprechaun introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].  They are always generated sleeping, and never in [[leprechaun hall]]s.  Note that leprechauns can [[grow up]] to be leprechaun wizards.

==Strategy==
Leprechauns are very similar to [[brownie]]s.  They are mid-level spellcasters who  are derived from a thieving monster, and more importantly, are always generated asleep.  They are truly best left this way; although they cannot steal your items as a brownie can, waking them up means you will be facing a fast, moderately tough spellcaster who is more than happy to [[curse items|curse your items]] and teleport away.  If you do find yourself facing an awake leprechaun wizard, it is advisable to ditch or stash your gold, to prevent it from teleporting away after every attack.

&&%s&& %s Amulet versus stone {148376 2022-10-04T23:00:52Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} cat The '''amulet versus stone''' is a SLASH'EM item which prevents stoning in much the same manner as an [[amulet of life saving]]. Unless it is cursed, instead of vanishing after saving your life, the amulet will change in beatitude (blessed to uncursed or uncursed to cursed). Thus, the same amulet can save your life multiple times, especially with a supply of [[holy water]]. Overall, it is generally inferior to an amulet of life saving; however, due to SLASH'EM's stronger stoning monsters, it can be a good item to have on hand if, say, a basilisk blocks off your escape route or an asphynx attacks from under that chest you were trying to loot. Also, if you have another source of reflection and drain resistance and haven't found an amulet of life saving, it's probably the best one to be wearing to prevent YASD.

&&%s&& %s Potion of invulnerability {150148 2023-03-07T18:03:30Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Description */* {{potion|name=invulnerability|cost=300}}

The '''potion of invulnerability''' is a [[potion]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].

==Generation==
Several potions of invulnerability are guaranteed in the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)|SLASH'EM special levels]], including:

* 1 on the [[Rat level]]
* 2 in [[Grund's Stronghold]]
* 2 in [[The Spider Caves]]

{{todo|More specific context on this.}}

==Description==
[[Quaff]]ing a potion of invulnerability will causes the player to become invulnerable for a few turns, with the duration depending on the potion's [[beatitude]]: a blessed potion makes you invulnerable for 12&ndash;15 turns, an uncursed one will make you invulnerable for 8&ndash;11, and a cursed potion only makes you invulnerable for 4&ndash;7.

The invulnerability from this potion is not the same as the "invulnerability" offered by a successful [[prayer]], and only protects from hit-point loss. A player made invulnerable via this potion will still be vulnerable to [[beheading]], due to its calculations using your maximum HP without inflicting direct HP loss; they are also still susceptible to [[petrification]], [[illness]] and other methods of [[instadeath]].

==Strategy==

In general, this potion is fairly useless.  Unlike in some other roguelikes, monsters in NetHack (and SLASH'EM) tend to inflict slow but steady damage over many turns, rather than a large amount in a short period of time.  This potion's duration is simply too short to make much of a difference, and its effectiveness is noticeably less than a burned [[Elbereth]] square.  Overall, it is a good candidate for [[dilution]].

&&%s&& %s Shopkeeper services {100993 2016-01-11T20:17:18Z {663 Qazmlpok} /* Strategy */ conduct Shopkeepers in [[SLASH'EM]] may offer the following services: identifying, uncursing, appraisal (saying how much damage a weapon does), weapon-works, armor-works and charging. All shops offer a form of identification but not necessarily any other services. The [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]] always possesses full identification services, appraisal, and uncursing services.{{refsrc|shknam.c|744|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

Sometimes shopkeepers may try to cheat you. The probability of this mainly depends on your Charisma. It will never happen if your Charisma is 10 or more and will always happen if it is 7 or less. If your Charisma is 8 or 9, shopkeepers will sometimes try to cheat you, with a probability dependent on your Luck.{{refsrc|shk.c|25|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} On a related note, many services will not work properly if you are hallucinating or confused.

The price of services will be mentioned under the individual service headings, but in general, it is strongly dependent on the object on which the service is being performed. Your charisma also affects the price of services, but to a lesser degree than it affects the price of objects.

You can open the Shopkeeper Services window by attempting to pay a shopkeeper.

== Availability of services ==
Not all shops offer all services.{{refsrc|shknam.c|752|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} All shops offer either basic or premier identification services. There is a 5/15 chance of both being available, 2/15 chance of only premier, and 8/15 chance of only basic identification.

All shops are capable of uncursing. Shops have a 1 in 3 chance of offering this service.

Weapon shops have a 1 in 3 chance of offering appraisal service. <!--The spoiler states that general shops may offer appraisal, and there is code to handle it, but I can't find any indication that general shops can ever offer it from the source (except the black market, which has everything)-->

Tool, jewelry, and spell shops have a 1 in 2 chance of offering basic charging. Wand shops have a 1 in 4 chance of offering basic charging and a separate 1 in 4 chance of offering premier charging.

Armor and weapon shops have independent 1 in 4 chances of offering repair and enchantment services. Weapon shops have an additional 1 in 4 chance of offering poisoning services.

== Pricing ==

All services have a base cost. This base cost is then modified by the player's [[charisma]]. If the service is being done in the [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]], the price is then multiplied by 3. The price is then restricted by the upper and lower bound associated with the service. The upper bound is also modified by charisma; every point of charisma above 10 will lower the upper bound by 2%, but never lower than the lower bound.{{refsrc|shknam.c|5489|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

The base price is modified as shown in this table.

== The services ==
=== Identifying ===

Shopkeepers offer both basic identification (just identifies the type of an object) and premier identification (completely identify an object, as a scroll of identify would). Basic identification does not reveal BUC and will never reveal information about the contents of a [[tin]]. The price varies with the type of object being identified, gems being the most expensive type.{{refsrc|shk.c|4712|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} Artifacts cost 1.5 times as much to identify as an ordinary item, and premier identify costs twice as much as basic, but an identify will never cost more than 750 zm. This means that jewellers and general stores are very handy for identifying all your gems, selling a few whenever you run low on gold.

|}

If you ask for the identification of an item which is already identified, the shopkeeper may try to cheat you, but you will be warned by the message "''Shopkeeper'' chuckles greedily..." before you pay any money.

After you've paid for the identification, a few things can still go wrong. If you're hallucinating, "You hear ''shopkeeper'' tell you it's a pot of flowers", and if you're confused "''shopkeeper'' tells you but you forget". If you asked the shopkeeper to identify an item which he/she doesn't sell, a basic identify has only a 1 in 2 chance of success and a premier identify a 1 in 4 chance.{{refsrc|shk.c|4762|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

=== Uncursing ===

All shopkeepers can offer uncursing, and can uncurse all types of object including ones they don't sell. The cost of uncursing an item is the same as the cost of that item, with a lower bound of 50 zm and an upper bound of 250 zm.{{refsrc|shk.c|4804|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

If you do not know that an item is cursed (i.e. it is not marked as cursed in your inventory), then the shopkeeper may cheat you by taking your money and not uncursing the item. You will know that this has happened because you will get the message "''Shopkeeper'' snickers and says "See, nice and uncursed!"". The shopkeeper will never warn you if the item was already uncursed, presumably because if they did, you could determine for free which of your items were cursed.{{refsrc|shk.c|4818|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

If you're confused, "You accidentally ask for the item to be cursed!" and the shopkeeper curses it. If you're hallucinating, there is a 1 in 4 chance that "Distracted by your blood-shot eyes, the shopkeeper accidentally blesses the item!" but a 3 in 4 chance that "You can't see straight and point to the wrong item!" and nothing happens.{{refsrc|shk.c|4827|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

=== Appraisal ===

The cost of appraisal is 1/3 of the cost of the weapon to be appraised, with a lower bound of 5 zm and an upper bound of 50 zm.

This is another service which does not work when you are hallucinating ("You hear ''shopkeeper'' say it'll "knock 'em dead"") or confused ("The numbers get all mixed up in your head."). Otherwise, you are told the basic damage your weapon does against small and large foes. General shopkeepers have a 1/10 chance of not being able to tell you anything about the weapon, a 1/10 chance of not being sure about small foes, and a 1/10 chance of not being sure about large foes.

=== Weapon works ===

Only weapons shops can offer weapon-works. All types of weapon improvement work properly when you are hallucinating or confused, although you may get YAFM.

Erodeproofing costs more the more eroded your weapon is, with a minimum of 200 zm and a maximum of 1500 zm. The base cost is 500 zm plus an additional 500 zm per level of erosion,{{refsrc|shk.c|5035|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} doubled if the item is an artifact. Note that multiple types of erosion '''will''' count towards this cost. A rusty corroded dagger has an effective -1 enchantment when used as a weapon, but is considered 2 levels of erosion for this service. If the object is erodeproof already, the shopkeeper will "give you a suspiciously happy smile" but will still attempt to charge you, regardless of your Charisma and Luck.

Note that ''tools'' may be made erodeproof and enchanted. This is a boon to people using pick-axes, unicorn horns and other skill-using tools as weapons.

Enchanting a weapon will increase the enchantment by +1. Enchanting a [[worm tooth]] will turn it into an uncursed [[crysknife]] without modifying the enchantment. The BUC of the object is otherwise unaffected, unlike the otherwise equivalent uncursed [[scroll of enchant weapon]]. Shopkeepers cannot enchant weapons beyond +5.{{refsrc|shk.c|5081|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} The cost of enchanting a weapon increases dramatically with its current enchantment. The base cost is 100 if the weapon is negatively enchanted, and otherwise (enchantment+1)^2 * 625 zm.{{refsrc|shk.c|5070|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} Artifacts cost twice as much. The base cost of enchanting a non-worm tooth, non-artifact weapon from +0 to +5 is 34,375 zm. The base price for enchanting is affected by charisma, but there is no upper limit.

Poisoning weapons costs 10 zm times the number of items (e.g. poisoning 50 darts would cost 500 zm). Unlike other services, this is a flat fee and is unaffected by charisma. The shopkeeper will not warn you if the item is already poisoned.

=== Armor works ===

Armor works are similar to weapon works. Only armor shops can offer armor works, the types of armor works offered are erodeproofing and enchanting, and both these improvements work even when you are hallucinating or confused.

Erodeproofing costs more the more eroded your armor is, with a minimum of 100 zm and a maximum of 1000 zm. The base cost is 300 zm plus an additional 300 zm per level of erosion,{{refsrc|shk.c|5165|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} doubled if the item is an artifact. There is no warning about armor which is already erodeproof.

Just as in the case of weapons, enchanting a piece of armor will increase the enchantment by +1 and will not normally modify the BUC. Enchanting [[dragon scales]] will turn the armor into the appropriate uncursed [[dragon scale mail]] without modifying the enchantment. Shopkeepers cannot enchant armor beyond +3{{refsrc|shk.c|5203|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}, but will take your zorkmids anyway. The cost of enchanting a piece of armor increases dramatically with its current enchantment. The base cost is 100 zm if the armor is negatively enchanted and otherwise (enchantment+1)^2 * 500 zm.{{refsrc|shk.c|5192|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} Artifacts cost twice as much. The base price for enchanting is affected by charisma, but there is no upper limit. The base price of enchanting a non-dragon scale, non-artifact piece of armor from +0 to +3 is 7,000 zm.

=== Charging ===

Wand, ring, tool and spellbook shops can offer charging, but shopkeepers will only charge the type of objects they sell. Note that lighting stores and general tool shops can both charge all types of tools. There are two types of charging: basic charging, which acts like an uncursed scroll of charging, and premier charging, which acts like a blessed scroll. Only wand shops offer premier charging.

The base cost of basic charging is 300 zm and the base cost of premier charging is 1000 zm, which is also the upper limit on the cost of charging.  Wands of wishing are an exception to this rule; the charge is outright tripled instead of being affected by charisma.

If you're confused or hallucinating, the shopkeeper may cheat you by taking your money and not charging the item. The message associated with this is "''Shopkeeper'' says it's charged and pushes you towards the door".

Otherwise, your item will be recharged. It has the same chance of blowing up as it would if it had been recharged with a scroll of charging.{{refsrc|shk.c|5320|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} If it's a wand, and it didn't blow up, it then gets some extra charges. A wand of wishing will get one extra charge if premier charging was used, bringing it to an otherwise unattainable (1:4). Recharging a wand of wishing with either method will result in the shopkeeper asking you to "loan him/her some money", and he/she will take all your unstashed gold.{{refsrc|shk.c|5345|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} Any other wand will get 5-9 more charges if it had fewer than 16, or one more charge if it had 16-19.{{refsrc|shk.c|5368|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

== Strategy ==
It's likely that only uncursing will be affordable enough for an early adventurer to use for any great effect. However, as long as you are testing the [[BUC]] status of your items with an altar, this shouldn't be necessary.

Later, when you've acquired enough [[gold]] or [[credit cloning|credit]], the other services will become more useful. Note however that gold is much more useful for [[gypsy|gypsies]] and the [[protection racket]], so you'll likely want to save it.

Most of the services will be used simply to save scrolls for [[wet|blanking]], and preserve your precious supply of [[holy water]]. However, tool shops' charging can be used to get unlimited food, from a [[horn of plenty]], and weapon- and armor-works can be used to build up all of your items to +3, leaving your scrolls for higher enchantments. Wand shops' premier charging service is especially useful, since it effectively gives you one extra charge on your [[wand of wishing]].

Shopkeeper services additionally provide a way to identify, curse, uncurse, enchant, and charge items without breaking any conducts, if the appropriate shops are found.

=== Potion farming ===
Even more useful than a free wish on your wand is dozens of [[wish]]es.
This is easiest if:
* [[smoky potion|Smoky potions]] are either potions of [[potion of acid|acid]], [[potion of booze|booze]], [[potion of fruit juice|juice]], [[potion of oil|oil]], or [[potion of sickness|sickness]].
* You have a [[blessed]] [[horn of plenty]].
* You've built up a sufficient credit at a tool shop which offers charging service; a non-eating pet can be used to continually credit clone, as can a hostile baby dragon and a [[spellbook of turn undead]]: baby dragons love gold and always leave corpses, and continually casting in SLASH'EM means you will never forget the spell.

To do this, simply keep charging and using your horn, quaffing all smoky potions you obtain. Eventually, you should release a dozen or so [[djinni|djinn]] grateful enough to offer you wishes.

Even if smoky potions are not produced by the horn, you can still use it to make even larger quantities of [[potion of water|water]] for [[polypiling]], or produce them by [[alchemy]] (not all potions have specific recipes, but combinations without any defined result can produce any potion). The worst case is when smoky potions are not food, and you lack a means of polypiling. However, since [[pill|pink pills]] are food, you will eventually get some from the horn, and thus a few wishes; it just takes a far longer time.

Allows you to learn the raise undead spell, new to [[SLASH'EM]]. There is a 72 in 73 chance of creating one undead monster and a 1 in 73 chance of creating five undead. The undead monsters will be {{white|V}} (1/10 chance), {{white|Z}} (4/10 chance), {{white|M}} (3/10 chance), {{white|&nbsp;}} (1/10 chance), or {{white|W}} (1/10 chance). [[Necromancer]]s begin with a spellbook of raise undead.

If the player is a [[Necromancer]] they will automatically attempt to dominate the resulting monster(s). If the player is not a necromancer but knows the [[spellbook of command undead|command undead spell]] they will automatically cast command undead<ref>{{sourcecode|read.c|1224|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>. In either case the monster(s) may resist, based on their [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]]. The differences between the two cases is that non-Necromancers must expend additional power to cast the second spell, and Necromancers will dominate the resulting monsters, even if they are not undead - this is especially relevant for [[fire vampire]]s and [[star vampire]]s, which are {{white|V}} but not undead.

Baseball bats are a weapon type in [[Slash'EM]] that use the [[Club]] skill and are more powerful than regular clubs. However, they aren't randomly generated, and are generally only seen as the [[base item]] for the [[Bat from Hell]]. You can find a normal one in a [[bones]] level if you already have the [[Bat from Hell]], or you can even [[wish]] for one.

&&%s&& %s Monster level {149580 2022-12-31T17:56:08Z {4001483 Cathartes} 3.6.6 refs, category '''Monster level''' is the experience level of a monster. It is used in the calculation of a monster's [[hit points]] and [[Experience|experience point]] value, and in [[to-hit|determining whether or not a monster's attack hits you]].
If the monster is a [[Monster spell|spellcaster]], then a higher level means a larger spell repertoire, usually containing more dangerous spells. Also, your [[pet]] uses monster level to decide whether or not to attack another monster.

The number of hit points of most monsters is [[D notation|(monster level)d8]]; because of that, monster level is also known as '''hit dice''', a term from [[Dungeons and Dragons]]. This is the meaning of "HD", which appears in the bottom status line when you are [[Polymorph#Self-polymorph|polymorphed]] into a monster.

==Calculation of monster level==

Each monster has a ''base level'', which can be found in the information box on the monster's page. However, not every monster will be generated at its base level; monster level is influenced by level depth and the hero's experience level.

Specifically, when a monster is generated, its level is determined as follows:{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1755|nethack=3.6.6}}
*Start with the monster's base level;
*If the level depth is lower than the monster's base level, subtract one;
*If the level depth is higher than the monster's base level, add one-fifth of the difference between the two (rounded down);
*If your experience level is higher than the monster's base level, add one-fourth of the difference between the two (rounded down);
*If the result is higher than 1.5 times the monster's base level (rounded down), then it is lowered to that number;
*If the result is higher than 49, then it is lowered to that number.
The final result is the monster's starting level.

If you are in the [[Endgame]], then your effective level depth is the depth of the Sanctum plus one half of your experience level. If you have the [[Amulet of Yendor]] but are not in the Endgame, then your effective level depth is the depth of the Sanctum.

There are a few ways for a monster to gain levels. For more information about this, see [[Growing up]].

==Exceptions==

The [[Wizard of Yendor]] is an exception to these rules. His level is 30, plus the number of times he has been killed, up to a maximum of 49.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1762|nethack=3.6.6}}

[[Player monsters]] that are generated when you arrive on the [[Astral Plane]] or the final level of the [[Wizard quest]] are another exception. They are generated at a random level, between {{rn1|16|15| and }} for the Astral Plane, and between 1 and 16 for the Wizard quest.{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|142|nethack=3.6.6}}

Similarly, your [[Angel|guardian angel]] on the [[Astral Plane]] is generated at a random level, between {{rn1|8|15| and }}.{{refsrc|src/minion.c|501|nethack=3.6.6}}

Named demons and the mail daemon (which are internally defined with "monster level" greater than 49) are another exception. They have a fixed starting number of hit points, and their starting level is one-fourth of that number (rounded down):{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|995|nethack=3.6.6}}

{|class=prettytable
|-
! Monster !! Starting hit points !! Starting level

Another exception is self-polymorph. When you polymorph into a monster, your hit dice (HD) will be equal to the monster's base level, without adjustment for dungeon depth or your natural form's level.{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|701|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Monster level and hit points==

*The number of hit points of most monsters is (monster level)d8.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|980|nethack=3.6.6}} Exceptions are [[golem]]s, the [[Rider]]s, the named demons, adult [[dragon]]s, [[elemental]]s created on their home planes, level 0 monsters, player monsters generated when you arrive on the [[Astral Plane]] or [[Wizard quest]]{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|143|nethack=3.6.6}}, and your [[Angel|guardian angel]] on the Astral Plane.{{refsrc|src/minion.c|502|nethack=3.6.6}} For more details, see [[Hit points#Monster|the hit points article]].
*When you are polymorphed into a monster, your monster form's hit points are (HD)d8. Exceptions to this are [[golem]]s, adult [[dragon]]s, [[elemental]]s (if you polymorph into one on its home plane), and HD:0 monsters.{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|702-L714|nethack=3.6.6}}

===Rate of fire===
Firearms, in general, have the potential to fire many shots per round. The rate of fire is computed as follows:
 Basic shots fired:
 Start with 1
 Add 1 if skilled, 2 if expert
 Add 1/3 the enchantment of the launcher, rounded down
 If player is limiting their shots fired, and this number is lower than above, use it instead
Your rate of fire starts as ''1d'' this number. Limiting shots fired is accomplished by typing, for example, "t3x", where x is the inventory letter of the ammunition. The number of shots fired is then modified as follows:
 Add ROF of firearm
 Subtract 1
 If in burst mode, divide the total number by 3, rounding down
 If in single shot mode, set the total to 1
Note that if you would fire less than one shot, you will instead fire one. The burst/single shot modes can be enabled on submachine guns, assault rifles and auto shotguns only. A couple of illustrative examples:
*A rogue with their starting +0 pistol, at basic skill level:
**Basic rate of fire: 1d1 (not skilled, no enchantment on launcher)
**Adding ROF of pistol, +0, gives 1d1
**Subtracting 1 gives 1d1 - 1
**Since this is always below 1, it is set to 1
**Note that advancing to skilled would still only allow said rogue to fire 1 shot. At expert, however, they could fire 1d3 - 1 shots.
*A tourist (basic skill) who found/enchanted a +6 assault rifle, firing in full automatic
**Basic rate of fire: 1d3 (not skilled, adding +6/3 from enchantment)
**Adding ROF of assualt rifle, +5, gives 1d3 + 5
**Subtracting 1 gives 1d3 + 4
**So, said tourist could fire between 5 and 7 shots. Choosing burst mode would limit this to between 2 and 3 shots, and choosing single shot mode would always fire 1 shot.
Note that it is possible even for unskilled adventurers to pick up and use an automatic firearm moderately effectively; even an unskilled user of an assault rifle will always fire at least five shots. Also note that when twoweaponing with two firearms, you will fire from both in one turn, possibly in different directions.

See individual weapon articles for a more detailed treatment of the rate of fire of each.

===Generation===
Firearms are never randomly generated. [[Rogue]]s and [[undead slayer]]s may start with one, they may be wished for, or they may be found on the members of the [[Yendorian Army]] and shopkeepers. The generation on mercenaries is as follows:
*Soldier:
**Equal chance of rifle or submachine gun
**2d25 + 4 bullets
**d6 + 5 frag grenades
*Sergeant:
**Equal chance of assault rifle or auto shotgun
**If assault rifle, has 2d30 + 4 bullets
**If auto shotgun, has 2d10 + 4 shotgun shells
**d5+2 grenades, equal chance of being gas or frag grenades
*Lieutenant:
**Equal chance of heavy machine gun or submachine gun
**If heavy machine gun, has 3d50 + 6 bullets
**If submachine gun, has 2d30 + 4 bullets
**2d6 + 10 grenades, with an equal chance of being gas or frag grenades
*Captain:
**50% chance of auto shotgun, 25% chance of heavy machine gun, 25% chance of assault rifle
**If auto shotgun, has 2d20 + 4 shotgun shells
**If heavy machine gun, has 3d60 + 6 bullets
**If assault rifle, has 2d60 + 4 bullets
**Additionally and independently, has 50% chance of rocket launcher, 25% chance of grenade launcher, and 25% chance of no additional firearms
**If rocket launcher, has d5 + 2 rockets
**If grenade launcher, has d5 + 2 grenades, equal chance of being frag or gas grenades
Shopkeepers always start with a shotgun and stack of shells. Note that they are the only source of the basic, one-handed shotgun.
Exploding grenades will destroy bullets and shells on the ground. Since the radius of effect of stacked grenades can be quite large, and grenades may trigger each other, this means that very frequently one may not find any ammunition on dead soldiers.

==Strategy==
===Firearm choice===
The firearms all have various benefits and drawbacks; however, by far the most practical choices are the submachine gun and the assault rifle:
*Pistol: This can be a [[rogue]] or an [[undead slayer|undead slayer's]] starting weapon.  It is decent in the starting game, but has far too low of a rate of fire to be useful later.
*Submachine gun: A very good choice, it is quite light (25) and fires relatively quickly.  It does suffer from a to-hit penalty, but this is more than offset by its rate of fire.  Easily found on basic soldiers.
*Assault rifle: Like the submachine gun, but fires more rapidly at the cost of greater weight and reduced accuracy.  Probably the best choice, as the -2 to-hit penalty becomes relatively insignificant in the later game.  Easy to find on sergeants and occasionally on captains.
*Rifle: Often a soldier's basic weapon, these are relatively accurate.  However, they fire even more slowly than a pistol, making them an impractical choice as compared to other weapons found on mercenaries.
*Sniper rifle: These are not randomly generated, and normally only a soldier in Grund's Stronghold will hold one.  It is essentially a more accurate, slower rifle.
*Heavy machine gun: These are far too heavy (500, half of a full inventory) to be useful.  They also are two-handed, and suffer from the largest to-hit penalty of any firearm.
*Shotgun: A [[shopkeeper|shopkeeper's]] preferred weapon, these are occasionally useful in the early game if you should happen to kill a shopkeeper.  They are very accurate and damaging, but the ammo is somewhat difficult to find.
*Auto shotgun: This weapon is accurate, quick-firing, and very damaging.  Unfortunately, it is also two-handed, making it impractical for most characters.  Also, as with the shotgun, the ammo is hard to find.
*Grenade launcher: While it is relatively light, [[grenade]]s are not.  It is not practical to accumulate grenades in quantities sufficient to make a grenade launcher useful.
*Rocket launcher: This is the heaviest of all firearms, weighing in at 750.  The ammo is also very rare and very heavy; no player could wield a rocket launcher with more than one rocket in open inventory without becoming burdened.

===General===
Firearms have the capability of doing more damage per round than any other weapon in the game, far and away. An expert user of a well-enchanted assault rifle can fire up to 9 shots in one round, doing up to 9d20 base damage. If the projectiles are enchanted as well, the damage is considerably increased. However, they do have downsides.
*The ammunition can be hard to find:
**This can be helped by good strategy, however. If you happen upon a [[barracks]], do your best to kill all the soldiers while they sleep, and be sure to collect and stash their ammo as you do. If you spot a grenade thrown near a pile of ammo, pick it up and throw it elsewhere. If you are careful, you can get large amounts of ammo from places such as [[Fort Ludios]] and the [[Castle]].
*The ammunition is heavy, and since it is always destroyed on impact, you must carry a lot of it. A [[bag of holding]] (or in particular the [[Wallet of Perseus]]) helps a fair amount, but one simply cannot find or carry enough ammunition to make firearms a valid choice for a main weapon throughout the whole game.
*Getting hit by grenade explosions removes all bullets from your open inventory, so if you have a large stack of bullets, you should carry most of them in a container. Having a stack of 100+ bullets in main inventory just tempts the game to spawn a soldier with grenades.
*Few roles can gain skill in firearms. [[Tourist]]s can gain basic proficiency, [[archeologist]]s and [[yeoman|yeomen]] can become skilled, and rogues and undead slayers can reach expert. All other roles are restricted.
In general, firearms are best used for clearing out specific areas. For example, the [[Astral Plane]] can be a breeze with a well-enchanted assault rifle and a large stack of enchanted ammo.  Even an unenchanted firearm can be useful to dispatch the [[Riders]] from a distance, as unlike most high-level adversaries in SLASH'EM, they lack [[Need +x weapon to hit|enchantment resistance]].  They are also generated with at most 80 hitpoints, so not much ammo will be required either.

When using firearms, one should be careful that no friendly monsters are in the line of fire.  While this is true of any [[multishot]]-capable ranged weapon, it bears repeating for firearms, due to their very high rates of fire.  In particular, one should be careful of [[shopkeepers]] and the [[high priest]]s.

Another use for those not interested in using the firearms is to simply sell them. Firearms are expensive and soldiers are generated with firearms in fairly large quantities, and soldiers and sergeants are generated in groups as well. The high price of the firearms means that it is possible to quickly drain a shopkeeper's gold and pay for [[shopkeeper services|services]] without the need for tedious [[credit cloning]]. This is especially useful in the [[tourist quest]], where there are large numbers of soldiers and many shops on the same level.

Large quantities in which bullets are found (you can collect several ''thousands'' of them in Fort Ludios alone) make them ideal candidates for [[Scroll of enchant weapon#Overenchanting strategy|overenchanting]] (a feat made slightly easier in SLASH'EM with [[Shopkeeper services#Weapon works|enchanting services]] and [[Spellbook of enchant weapon|enchant weapon spell]]); you can then polymorph them into something more useful, like a [[Excalibur|long sword]], or leave some for more tough opponents.

==Real life==
In real life, several of these weapons can't share ammunition.

==Variants==
===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], firearms and ammunition are far lighter. Combined with a much higher weight cap, firearms are a viable option as a primary weapon. They can also be randomly generated, plus there are additional monsters that may be generated with firearms and bullets in their starting inventory.

===dNetHack===
[[dNetHack]] incorporates the (slightly modified) firearm code, and additionally implements several types of ''blasters'' that use the same skill.  [[Anachrononaut]]s and [[Pirate]]s can achieve '''expert''' proficiency, [[Archeologist]]s can advance to '''skilled''', and [[Tourist]]s are limited to '''basic''' skill.  All other roles are restricted.
However, it must be noted that in dNetHack firearms are exceedingly rare: they are not normally generated, and, with the exception of the lowly [[flintlock]], are classified as [[Anachrononaut#Future Tech|future tech]], making them unwishable except by Tourists.  For non-Anachrononauts the most common way to obtain a firearm is to find it in a bones pile.  Even then, the only reliable sources of bullets are [[wish]]ing, a ''bullet fabber'' which is also future tech, and [[wandering pirate]]s which appear if you have the Pirate quest artifact.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], shopkeepers are generated with shotguns and shotgun shells. These may be generated in many different materials due to the [[object materials]] system in SpliceHack.

to this page so we'll get collapsible tables etc.? [[mediawikiwiki:Extension:ShowHide]] has more information. Thanks! :) -- [[User:Schneelocke|Schnee]] 21:13, May 4, 2010 (UTC)
: Your request seems reasonable, and I've added the line.  You might need to use the refresh function on your browser before you see a hide button on your [[Template:Gods|Gods]] template.--[[User:Ray Chason|Ray Chason]] 18:17, May 5, 2010 (UTC)

:: Wonderful, thanks! -- [[User:Schneelocke|Schnee]] 18:18, May 5, 2010 (UTC)

== Random rumours ==

[[Template:Random true rumor]]'s javascript doesn't seem to actually be in place.  Does anybody know what the code was supposed to be?  If not I can write it. --[[User:TPGreyKnight|TPGreyKnight]] ([[User talk:TPGreyKnight|talk]]) 22:47, 24 June 2012 (UTC)

:The comment for [{{fullurl:Template:Random_true_rumor|diff=68785&oldid=68784}} this edit] links to http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Su9PQsxF, which seems to contain the necessary code.  Alternatively, the edit could simply be reverted.

:Given the size of the script (23 kB uncompressed, 8 kB compressed), I'd be hesitant to just include it in Common.js.  Instead, we could lazy-load it, e.g. by putting it in [[MediaWiki:Rumors.js]] and adding the following code to Common.js:

<source lang="JavaScript">
jQuery( document ).ready( function( $ ) {
    if ( $( '.nhw-randomtruerumor' ).length > 0 ) {
        importScript( 'MediaWiki:Rumors.js' );
    }
} );</source>

:This would make the script slightly slower to load the first time, but would avoid loading the whole rumors list on pages that don't use the feature (which means pretty much all of them, except [[Main Page]]). --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] ([[User talk:Ilmari Karonen|talk]]) 23:17, 27 June 2012 (UTC)
::I agree, that would be a better approach.  Someone who can edit Mediawiki: pages should do that, hint hint <tt>;-)</tt> --[[User:GreyKnight|GreyKnight]] ([[User talk:GreyKnight|talk]]) 17:10, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
:::I'm no expert, but what about putting all of the rumors into a hidden div on the main page and use a tiny script to read the text of a random one into the rumor placeholder? The script itself isn't complicated; it's only large because it contains all of the rumors. Could that be a viable solution? -- [[User:Qazmlpok|Qazmlpok]] ([[User talk:Qazmlpok|talk]]) 20:46, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
::::That could work too, but it might slow down page loading (especially if the div was in the middle of the page, rather than at the end).  Anyway, I went and implemented the suggestion I made above.  If you get any errors, or keep seeing only rumors about acid blobs on the Main Page after [[wikipedia:WP:BYC|clearing your cache]], let me know.  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] ([[User talk:Ilmari Karonen|talk]]) 16:47, 31 July 2012 (UTC)}

The '''Basilisk''' is one of two monsters added in [[SLASH'EM]] that share the [[cockatrice]]'s petrification attacks. A basilisk is capable of killing you in the same way a cockatrice is; touching a living or deceased basilisk with an exposed part of your body is instadeath, and the basilisk causes delayed petrification in the same manner as a cockatrice. See the article on the cockatrice for specifics of petrification.

A basilisk is more dangerous than a cockatrice, as it has a higher level and thus more hit points, and is also faster.

== Strategy ==

The basilisk is more dangerous than a cockatrice, but is still slow and relatively easy to hit. Ranged or magical attacks are advisable.

SLASH'EM's additional petrifying monsters means that it is no longer possible to avoid potential [[YASD]]s by blessed genociding c, as neither the [[asphynx]] nor the basilisk are c.

The corpse of a basilisk can be used as a weapon, but weighs too much for it to be effective.

A basilisk weighs the same as a human and is considered a strong monster, making them superior polymorph forms for travel than a cockatrice or asphynx. Unlike the other two, polymorphing into a basilisk will not severely decrease your carrying capacity, making it more suitable for extended periods of staying polymorphed. Female characters can also polymorph into a basilisk to lay eggs, either to hatch into tame basilisks or to use as a weapon.

==Origin==

The basilisk is closely related to the [[Cockatrice]]. The exact meaning of basilisk/cockatrice is a bit unclear, sometimes they are used as synonyms, other times a basilisk is a different monster. This is why they share the same encyclopedia entry.

The basilisk is alleged to be incubated by a rooster from the egg of a serpent or toad.
For the Cockatrice it's the reverse. A rooster's egg incubated by a serpent or toad. Yolkless eggs, were traditionally believed to have been laid by roosters.
