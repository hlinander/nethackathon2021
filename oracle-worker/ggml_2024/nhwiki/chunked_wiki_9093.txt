: ''"In the morning you awake, collect your belongings, and set off for the dungeon. After several days of uneventful travel, you see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of Menace.

==Vulture's Introduction==
[[File:Vultures-eye-intro.gif|thumb|right|The graphical introduction to [[Vulture's Eye]] ]]

[[Vulture's]] interfaces provide an illustrated introduction that mostly follows the plot from the Guidebook (with a few minor differences). Upon the creation of a new character (after selection of race, role, gender and alignment), Vulture displays a sequence of images with captions, while the intro theme music plays. The player may either wait through this introduction or press any key to skip the entire introduction. After this introduction, Vulture starts the game and the usual in-game introduction ("It is written in the book of...") appears.

== UnNetHack ==
[[UnNetHack]] randomizes the name of the [[Marduk#UnNetHack|creator deity]]. Additionally, [[convict]]s get a somewhat different introduction text:

 It is written in the Book of Tymora:
 
     After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
     against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
     Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
     the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
     and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
     Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.
 
 Your goddess Tymora seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
 to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.
 
 You, a newly escaped Detainee, have chosen to redeem
 yourself by recovering the Amulet for Tymora.  You are
 determined to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die
 in the attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For
 the sake of us all:  Go bravely with Tymora!

&&%s&& %s Wield {144228 2022-01-24T10:54:34Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{Keyboard commands}}
Press {{kbd|w}} to '''wield''' a [[weapon]].  

To attack a [[monster]] in melee, try to move into its square.  To use a [[ranged weapon]], wield the launcher if applicable, then {{kbd|t}} throw or {{kbd|f}} fire the ammunition (after placing the ammunition in your {{kbd|q}} quiver).  It is not necessary to wield a thrown weapon, such as a [[dagger]] or [[dart]]s, unless throwing [[Mjollnir]] or an [[aklys]].

You can have a secondary weapon, and switch between both with {{kbd|x}}; to set a weapon as your secondary weapon, press {{kbd|x}} - your main weapon will become secondary, and you will be barehanded - then wield your other weapon.

You can wield items other than weapons.
* You can wield nothing "-" to fight bare handed.
* Applying a pick axe, tin opener, [[polearm]], or [[lance]] causes you to wield it.
* Rubbing a lamp causes you to wield it.
* If you wield a cursed item, you can then [[remove curse|remove the curse]] using the uncursed scroll or unskilled spell. If the item is not a weapon or a weapon-tool it will ''not'' weld itself to your hand.
* You can wield a [[cockatrice]] or [[chickatrice]] corpse and use it as a potent weapon, provided you are wearing [[gloves]]. '''Caution''' - mistakes are [[cockatrice#Petrification by a corpse|fatal]].

Besides hitting in melee, wielding has (at least) the following effects.  (See the bolded link for details.)
* Wielding a '''[[launcher]]''' (any bow; crossbow; sling) allows you to throw matching [[projectile]]s (arrows; crossbow bolts; rocks or gems or gray stones) much more effectively.
* An uncursed '''[[scroll of remove curse]]''' uncurses the item you are wielding.  (It also uncurses armor worn and items used in a few other ways, but wielding is the only way that uncurses any type of item.)
* A '''[[scroll of enchant weapon]]''' acts on a wielded weapon.
* '''[[Force|Forcing]]''' the lock of a [[container|large box or chest]] uses the weapon you are wielding.  Edged weapons may be destroyed, while blunt weapons may destroy the chest along with some of its contents.  Be careful what you wield.
* When eating a non-blessed '''[[tin]]''', you try to open it with what you are wielding, which dramatically affects the time to open.  Wielding a [[tin opener]] is the fastest, then any [[dagger]], [[athame]] or crysknife, then a [[pickaxe]] or [[axe]] (but not a [[battle-axe]]).  
* Wearing or wielding the '''[[Amulet of Yendor]]''' gives you messages when you are near magic portals.
* Some artifacts will [[artifact blast|blast you]] when you wield them, depending on your class, alignment, and even occasionally [[Sting|race]].
* Certain [[artifact weapons]] gives you effects while wielded:
** '''[[Magicbane]]''' gives magic resistance and catches curses;
** '''[[The Staff of Aesculapius]]''' gives hungerless regeneration and drain resistance; 
** '''[[Stormbringer]]''' gives drain resistance and bloodthirst (attacking peaceful monsters without confirmation); 
** '''[[Mjollnir]]''' can be thrown when wielded if your [[strength]] is 25, and will return to a [[valkyrie]]'s hand 99% of the time.
** '''[[Sunsword]]''' acts as a light source and protects you from light-based blinding;
** '''[[Fire and Frost Brand|Fire or Frost Brand]]''' gives fire or cold resistance; 
** '''[[Grayswandir]]''' protects from hallucination; 
** '''[[The Longbow of Diana]]''' gives reflection; 
** '''[[Sting]]''' warns you about orcs and lets you escape webs.
* '''[[Footrice]] corpses''' may stone you, such as when you are not wearing gloves or if you fall down the stairs, a pit, a hole or a trapdoor.

Monsters also wield weapons before using them.  This takes time for them.  This may help you identify that a weapon is cursed, because if you see a monster wield it, you get a message.

&&%s&& %s Mineral {142407 2021-09-06T21:39:25Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''Mineral''' is the material of rocks, stones and boulders. By definition it can be surmised that the [[dungeon]] in general is comprised of mineral.

Mineral cannot be [[eat]]en, resists any form of [[corrosion]] or rust and does not burn. All tangible mineral items can be converted to dead meat or living flesh using the [[stone to flesh]] spell.

==Mineral items==
*[[Rock]]s and [[boulder]]s.
*[[Flintstone]]s, [[loadstone]]s, [[luckstone]]s and [[touchstone]]s.
*Marble [[wand]]s.
*Granite, opal, clay, coral, black onyx and moonstone [[ring]]s.

*[[crysknife|Crysknives]].
*[[Stone golem]]s owe their thick hide attribute to their mineral constitution. Polymerging too many mineral items will result in one being created, as will inflicting stoning on another golem.
*[[Gemstone]] is a similar material in many ways, and is affected by [[stone to flesh]] in the same way.

&&%s&& %s Shock {129749 2019-12-17T02:19:15Z {4001163 Pinkbeast} edit In NetHack, various types of electrical attacks deal '''shock''' damage:

* Zapped or broken [[wand of lightning]]
* [[Mjollnir]]'s lightning strike bonus
* [[Melee]] attacks of [[grid bug]]s and [[electric eel]]s
* [[Explosion]] attack of [[shocking sphere]]s
* [[Engulf]]ing and [[passive attack]]s of [[energy vortex|energy vortices]]
* Lightning breath of [[blue dragon]]s and the [[Chromatic Dragon]]
* The [[Lightning (monster spell)|lightning]] [[monster spell]]
* Lightning bolt sent by a god through an altar in a [[temple]], against a hero who attacks the attendant [[Aligned priest|priest]]
* Lightning from [[Anger#Smiting|divine wrath]]
* Lightning strikes in the [[Cloudy area|clouds]] on the [[Plane of Air]]
* Surges of electricity from [[container trap]]s
* Electric shocks from sitting on a [[throne]]

[[Ray]] attacks that deal shock damage are lightning.  For example, the game will say that a blue dragon "breathes lightning".  However, not all attacks described as 'lightning' are rays.  For example, an angry deity may [[smite]] you with "lightning", but this is a localized attack that targets the hero, not a directional ray.  These types of lightning may be blocked by [[reflection]], like a ray, but since they are non-directional they cannot be redirected to hit other monsters, unless there is a monster [[engulf]]ing the hero.

==Effects==
===Rings and wands===
In addition to lowering hit points, most shock attacks have a chance of destroying [[ring]]s and [[wand]]s carried in your open inventory.  Rings and wands will not be destroyed if they are stored inside a container.

The [[ring of shock resistance]] and [[wand of lightning]], as items that are specially linked to lightning, are immune to shock damage, and can be kept in open inventory without being destroyed by shock attacks.

The only item-destroying shock attacks that aren't blocked by [[reflection]] are those from electric eels, container traps, Mjollnir, and unusually high-level grid bugs.  None of these is common so they can usually be avoided, so you don't need to keep backup rings if you're careful (but it still never hurts).

===Status afflictions===
Most attacks described as "lightning" are accompanied by a flash of light that [[blind]]s the player when they hit.  This happens even if the lightning bolt is reflected.

Lightning strikes from the clouds on the [[Plane of Air]] also cause [[deafness]] and [[paralysis]].

==Shock protection==
Damage to yourself or your inventory can be prevented or minimized by the following:

* '''Resistance''': Intrinsic or extrinsic [[shock resistance]] prevents or reduces hit point loss from shock attacks.  It does not prevent blindness from lightning flashes or prevect wands and rings from being destroyed.
* '''Reflection''': Many shock attacks described as lightning, including lightning rays, can be [[Reflection|reflected]] away, preventing damage to yourself and your items.  Reflection will not prevent blindness, however.
* '''Magic cancellation''': High [[MC]] can protect your inventory from melee shock attacks.  It does not prevent damage from passive or engulfing shock attacks, or from lightning.  Nor does it prevent blindness.
* '''Blindness''': Being already blinded by a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]], or a self-applied [[cream pie]] or [[expensive camera]], will prevent the longer-lived blindness caused by lightning.  You may prefer to let yourself be blinded, though, if you have one or more reliable cures available, or if you have [[telepathy]].

==System shock==
{{main|System shock}}
[[Polymorph]]ing has a chance of damaging or even destroying targets, including the player.  This effect is called "system shock", but it is not related to shock damage and is not prevented by shock resistance.

==SLASH'EM==
The following new [[SLASH'EM]] [[monster (SLASH'EM)|monsters]] have shocking attacks: [[static blob]]s, [[spark bug]]s, [[arc bug]]s, [[lightning bug]]s, [[sapphire golem]]s, and [[crystal golem]]s.  

SLASH'EM also includes a new [[spellbook of lightning|lightning]] spell that the player can learn.

'''Air''' is a terrain type that only appears on the [[Plane of Air]] and in the form of bubbles on the [[Plane of Water]]. It is extremely hard to move on unless you are [[levitating]] or [[fly]]ing, and attempting to move otherwise may cause you to tumble. However, it is still possible to move across air by [[hurtle|hurtling]] due to Newton's Third Law; in other words, by throwing things in the direction opposite of the one you want to move in. Beware, this will freeze you for one turn per square travelled.
