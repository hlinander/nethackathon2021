The enlightenment from invoking the Eyes can be used as a method to [[identify]] useful [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s.

===Gaze attacks===
Because Nethack assumes line-of-sight is symmetrical&mdash;that is, if you have a clear line of sight to a monster, it can see you too&mdash;monsters are capable of using gaze attacks through walls and other obstructions if they are within a three-tile radius while you are wearing the Eyes. This can be lethally tragic when dealing with [[Medusa]], or if a pesky [[umber hulk]] on the other side of an [[phasing|unphaseable]] or [[undiggable]] wall repeatedly confuses you. In such cases, it may be necessary to temporarily remove the Eyes, as astral vision becomes a liability instead of a boon.

===Zen conduct===
If you are attempting the [[Zen]] conduct, '''do ''not'' wear this item under any circumstances''', as it will instantly break the conduct. As it no longer provides a benefit when carried and the invocation effect of enlightenment is easily achieved through other means, it's best to ignore this artifact altogether to avoid the risk of accidentally wearing it.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|The Eyes of the Overworld}}
''The Eyes of the Overworld'' is a 1966 novel in the ''Dying Earth'' series by [[Jack Vance]]. The anti-hero Cugel, a resourceful but amoral rogue, is tasked by a wizard to obtain the titular artifact from a squalid village whose "aristocracy" wears the Eyes, which allow them to see everything around them as though it were opulent luxury - fittingly, the Eyes are depicted as literal rose-tinted contact lenses.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
... and finally there is "the Eyes of the Overworld".  This obscure artifact pushes the wearer's view sense into the "overworld" -- another name for a segment of the Astral Plane. Usually, there is nothing to be seen.  However, the wearer is also able to look back and see the area around herself, much like looking on a map.  Why anyone would want to ...

'''The Orb of Detection''' is the [[Archeologist]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Archeologist quest]], and is [[lawful]] for [[wishing]] purposes. Its [[base item]] type is a [[crystal ball]].

==Effects==
While carried, the Orb of Detection confers [[magic resistance]], [[telepathy]] and [[half spell damage]]; [[invoking]] the Orb toggles [[invisibility]] on or off. The Orb of Detection can also be [[applied]] like any crystal ball for the same effects.

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Invoke#Optimum invocation schedule|Invoke § Optimum invocation schedule]]''
Archaeologists' high [[intelligence]] let them make good use of the Orb of Detection for [[portal detection methods|portal detection]]. The invoke effect is not useful, since sources of invisibility are common.

If you are carrying it for its magic resistance, it is recommended to find a source of worn magic resistance before challenging the [[Wizard of Yendor]], since he can steal it. 

As a lawful artifact wish, the Orb of Detection has a more useful base type than the [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]] and provides half spell damage. However, it is much heavier.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|For crystal balls in general: You can now search for [[dungeon feature]]s by entering any of [[Staircase|{{white|<}}]] [[Staircase|{{white|>}}]] [[Altar|{{white|_}}]] [[Throne|{{white|\}}]] [[Sink|{{white|#}}]] [[Fountain|{{white|{}}]].

Crystal balls are now generated with 3-7 charges. Uncursed charging adds 1-2 charges up to the maximum of 7. Blessed charging increases the number of charges to 7 and also blesses the ball. Cursed charging removes all charges and curses the ball.

Applying a [[cancelled]] crystal ball now destroys it, regardless of whether or not it is an artifact.}}

==Variants==
Many variants implement [[L (person)|L]]'s Itlachiayaque Patch, which has the Orb of Detection replaced by [[Itlachiayaque]], a lawful-aligned [[shield of reflection]] with some similar properties. xNetHack implements this patch, but additionally allows Itlachiayaque to be [[invoked]] and used like a crystal ball; [[EvilHack]] instead replaces the Orb with [[Xiuhcoatl]], a lawful [[atlatl]].

'''The Heart of Ahriman''' is the [[Barbarian]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Barbarian quest]], and is [[neutral]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its [[base item]] type is a [[luckstone]].

==Effects==
When carried, The Heart of Ahriman confers [[stealth]]. When [[invoked]], it toggles [[levitation]] on or off. While levitating, you can use the {{kbd|>}} key to end the effect and return to the ground, as with a blessed [[potion of levitation]]; dropping the artifact will also end the effect.

When [[thrown]] as a projectile weapon, The Heart of Ahriman gives +d5 [[to-hit]]; when [[sling|slung]], it also does [[double damage]] to the [[monster]] it hits.

==Strategy==
{{main|Invoke#Optimal invocation schedule}}

The Heart of Ahriman is considered one of the weaker quest artifacts, as most Barbarians will gain [[intrinsic]] stealth from reaching XL 15, and there is a luckstone guaranteed in [[Mines' End]]. Its increased damage as a projectile is almost completely useless—not only is the [[sling]] skill considered useless and [[restricted]] for Barbarians anyway, but even the most outside scenarios where a player will want to fire the Heart of Ahriman carries the risk of shooting it into water or any other location that makes it difficult to retrieve.

However, as a source of levitation, the Heart is preferable to a supply of potions, though less desirable than the [[ring of levitation]] or [[boots of levitation]]; if invoked while [[riding]], the artifact will also levitate both you and your steed, and unlike a [[spellbook of levitation|spell]] or blessed potion you will not have to re-mount them. You can also simply end the levitation at any time via {{kbd|>}} or dropping the artifact to cut down on #invoke reliance. As always, keep your eyes open for a [[bullwhip]] if you want to retrieve loot—[[apply]]ing a bullwhip is reliant on [[dexterity]], an attribute Barbarians tend to be high in.

As an [[intelligent artifact]], it will also resist the [[curse items]] spell 80% of the time, which is a useful property for a luckstone in particular due to the negative effects they have when cursed.

==Origin==
In the universe of ''[[wikipedia:Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Barbarian]]'', the Heart of Ahriman is a powerful artifact, the one thing that can allow a man to stand against the powerful wizard Xaltotun. It was also featured in the movie "Conan the Destroyer".

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, the Heart of Ahriman is vulnerable to the {{spell of|stone to flesh}} spell, which will turn it into a normal meatball. This was fixed in [[NetHack 3.6.0]], where the artifact will resist the spell.

Attempting to [[Naming artifacts|name an ordinary luckstone as The Heart of Ahriman]] always makes your hand slip and gives it another name. Before version 3.6, you could exploit the naming artifacts bug and try to name ''any'' unidentified gray stone as The Heart of Ahriman; if it succeeds, then you know that it was not a luckstone. Together with kicking (to detect [[loadstone]]s) and rubbing (to detect [[touchstone]]s), this bug provides a surefire way to distinguish any unidentified [[gray stone]]. The artifact naming trick does not work in Nethack 3.6.0 and later versions, [[NAO]]'s version of 3.4.3, or in many of the [[variant]]s based on it.

==Message==
{{message|You feel a surge of power, but nothing seems to happen.|You invoked the Heart of Ahriman while already possessing uncontrolled levitation from another source.}}

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], the Heart of Ahriman grants [[displacement]] rather than stealth when carried, as well as the same faster [[power]] regeneration that [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]] grants.

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], [[invoke|invoking]] the Heart of Ahriman [[remove curse|removes curses]] instead of toggling levitation.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the Heart of Ahriman is a [[ruby]] that grants [[magic resistance]], [[reflection]], [[half spell damage]], [[drain resistance]], [[fire resistance]], and [[poison resistance]] while carried, and #invokes for [[curse removal]], with the exact effects depending on BUC. If cursed, it uncurses itself; otherwise, it acts as a [[scroll of remove curse]] of the same [[beatitude]]. This makes it significantly more useful in general, and the spell-casting monsters introduced in dNetHack are likely to ensure that a [[Barbarian]] (or anyone stumbling upon the Heart in one's bones) will want as many different sources of MR as they can get.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The other three drew in their breath sharply, and the dark,
powerful man who stood at the head of the sarcophagus whispered:
"The Heart of Ahriman!"  The other lifted a quick hand
for silence.  Somewhere a dog began howling dolefully, and a
stealthy step padded outside the barred and bolted door. ...
But none looked aside from the mummy case over which the man
in the ermine-trimmed robe was now moving the great flaming
jewel, while he muttered an incantation that was old when
Atlantis sank.  The glare of the gem dazzled their eyes, so
that they could not be sure what they saw; but with a
splintering crash, the carven lid of the sarcophagus burst
outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied from
within and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the
occupant -- a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried
brown limbs like dead wood showing through moldering bandages.
"Bring that thing back?" muttered the small dark man who
stood on the right, with a short, sardonic laugh.  "It is
ready to crumble at a touch.  We are fools ---"

'''The Sceptre of Might''' is the [[Caveman]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Caveman quest]], and is [[lawful]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its base item type is a [[mace]].

==Effects==
When wielded, the Sceptre confers [[magic resistance]]; it has +d5 to-hit and deals double damage against monsters with a different alignment than the Sceptre. [[Invoking]] the Sceptre toggles [[conflict]] on or off; if the Sceptre leaves your main inventory, it will also stop causing conflict. Conflict caused by the Sceptre does not cause the usual [[nutrition]] drain.

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Invoke#Optimum invocation schedule|Invoke § Optimum invocation schedule]]''
Thanks to its alignment-based [[double damage]], the Sceptre is one of the best weapons in the game versus cross-aligned monsters, and your quest artifact is always co-aligned. Since most monsters in the game are either [[neutral]] or [[chaotic]], for [[lawful]] characters the Sceptre is a great weapon, comparable even with a similarly enchanted [[Grayswandir]] against most non-silver hating monsters. However, the Sceptre is a somewhat weaker artifact for [[neutral]] Cavepeople; this becomes particularly noticeable in [[Gehennom]]. [[Erosion]]-proofing is recommended in either case, as quest artifacts are not generated damage-proof like [[sacrifice gift]]s; a backup source of magic resistance is also recommended, as the [[Wizard of Yendor]] can steal the Sceptre from you.

The magic resistance, damage bonuses and conflict toggle also make the Sceptre of Might a viable (though optional) artifact [[wish]] for [[Knight]]s and lawful [[Priest]]s that have an early one to spare.

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

|}

==History==
The Sceptre of Might is introduced along with most of the other quest artifacts in [[NetHack 3.1.0]]; from this version to [[NetHack 3.1.3]], its base item type was a [[quarterstaff]].

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], earlier versions and some variants based on them, the Sceptre of Might's magic resistance was conferred when carried.

==Messages==
{{message|You feel like a rabble-rouser.|You invoked the Sceptre of Might and are now causing [[conflict]].}}
{{message|You feel the tension decrease around you.|You invoked the Sceptre of Might (or it left your main inventory), and you are no longer causing conflict.}}
{{message|You feel a surge of power, but nothing happens.|You invoked the Sceptre, but you were already causing conflict by other means.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], The Sceptre of Might confers its magic resistance while carried, but its bonuses are significantly lowered to +3 to-hit and +5 bonus damage versus cross-aligned monsters, making it much weaker as a weapon.{{refsrc|artilist.h|331|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} [[Artifact blast]]s also do far more damage at 8d10 (or 6d10 with magic resistance).

The Sceptre is still a solid artifact for its magic resistance and hunger-less conflict invoke, but is heavily outclassed in terms of damage by other artifact weapons such as the [[Sword of Justice]] and [[The Stake of Van Helsing]]; [[The Crown of Saint Edward]] and the [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]] are also comparable candidates for lawful artifact sources of magic resistance.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], The Sceptre of Might is the [[Priest]] quest artifact, replacing the removed [[the Mitre of Holiness]]; it confers [[drain resistance]] when wielded, and invoking it provides an [[energy]] boost instead of toggling conflict. Cavemen have a new quest artifact called [[Big Stick]], which confers magic resistance when wielded and can be invoked for conflict akin to the vanilla Sceptre.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the Sceptre of Might has its base item type changed to a [[rod]], which is made of gemstone and deals slightly more damage against large monsters than a mace (1d8); this and its base material of [[gemstone]] makes the Sceptre a significantly better weapon. Of note is that the Wizard of Yendor is capable of weapon attacks in EvilHack, and will use the Sceptre against you should he steal it.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
This mace was created aeons ago in some unknown cave, and has been passed down from generation to generation of cave dwellers.  It is a very mighty mace indeed, and in addition will protect anyone who wields it from magic missile attacks.  When invoked, it causes conflict in the area around it.

'''The Magic Mirror of Merlin''' is the [[Knight]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Knight quest]], and is [[lawful]] for [[wishing]] purposes. Its base item type is a [[mirror]].

==Effects==
When carried, the Magic Mirror of Merlin confers [[magic resistance]] and [[telepathy]]. In addition, Knights do double damage to their enemies with some wands and most spells.

When [[applied]] or [[wield]]ed, the Mirror speaks to you and gives a random rumor - the rumor is true if the Mirror is blessed, false if cursed and either if uncursed. It shares this property with [[The Master Key of Thievery]].

===Double damage===
A Knight carrying the Magic Mirror of Merlin in open inventory deals double damage to monsters when zapping the following wands or spells:{{refsrc|src/zap.c|142|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3750|nethack=3.6.6}}

* [[wand of striking]], spell of {{Spell of|force bolt}}
* [[wand of undead turning]], spell of {{Spell of|turn undead}}
* spell of {{Spell of|sleep}} (0, doubled)
* spell of {{Spell of|drain life}}
* spell of {{Spell of|magic missile}}
* spell of {{Spell of|cone of cold}} (only if [[Skill|unskilled or basic]])
* spell of {{Spell of|fireball}} (only if unskilled or basic)
* spell of {{Spell of|finger of death}}

Other effects of these spells (such as the number of levels drained by drain life or the duration of sleep) are not changed.

==Strategy==
The Magic Mirror of Merlin is a worthwhile choice for lawful non-Knights making an artifact wish due to the magic resistance and telepathy it provides. [[The Sceptre of Might]] is a comparable lawful artifact in terms of desirability, but only confers magic resistance when wielded; the Magic Mirror only needs to be carried, making it preferable in that regard.

Some players recommend making knights [[spellcaster]]s in anticipation of obtaining the Magic Mirror and using its double damage effect; [[magic missile]] does enormous damage (with an average of 112) when cast by a level thirty Knight with the Magic Mirror.<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_frm/thread/c67ffc6f2d005d32/7d8d9704d183a623</ref> However, a Knight's starting stats make this somewhat impractical to attempt until much later on.

==Variants==
===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], The Magic Mirror of Merlin's magic resistance has been removed and replaced with [[reflection]] and [[half spell damage]].

'''The Mitre of Holiness''' is the [[Priest]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Priest quest]], and is [[lawful]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its [[base item]] type is a [[helm of brilliance]].

==Effects==
When carried, the Mitre of Holiness confers [[fire resistance]]. When worn, it also provides the normal effects of a helm of brilliance, as well as extrinsic [[protection]] - augmenting your [[magic cancellation]] as a [[ring of protection]], but not cumulative with one. If the wearer is a Priest, they also take half physical damage from all [[undead]] monsters and major [[demon]]s - this property does not stack with other [[half physical damage]] sources.{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1658|nethack=3.6.1}}

When [[invoked]], you get an [[energy]] boost equal to half of your maximum power, with a cap of 120; if it would have given you less than 12 energy, it fully refills your energy instead.<ref>[[artifact.c#line1238]] (code for <code>ENERGY_BOOST</code> effect)</ref>

The Mitre of Holiness is defined by the game as doing double damage to [[undead]], and thus cannot be used by a player polymorphed into an undead creature. It does not do double damage to undead when used as a weapon in practice, however, due to the game not checking for artifact damage bonuses when fighting with objects that aren't valid weapons.

==Strategy==

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and variants based on it, The Mitre of Holiness does not provide protection.

'''The Longbow of Diana''' is the [[Ranger]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Ranger quest]], and is [[chaotic]] for [[wishing]] purposes. Its [[base item]] type is a [[bow]].

==Description==
When carried, the Longbow of Diana confers [[telepathy]]; when wielded, it confers [[reflection]] and grants a +d5 to-hit bonus when [[firing]] [[arrow]]s. [[Invoking]] the Bow creates arrows with the same [[beatitude]] as the bow and places them in your [[inventory]], with a small chance of producing [[poisoned]] arrows; if you are [[fumbling]] or there is no open space, the arrows will drop to the floor on your square. Beatitude also influences the amount of arrows created each time: a blessed Bow creates more [[arrows]], up to 21 per invoke, while a cursed Bow will create fewer, at most 11 per invoke.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Rangers get a [[multishot]] bonus when wielding the Longbow of Diana.}}

===Arrow creation details===
{{main|RNE}}
The [[enchantment]] range of the arrows is inclusive and depends on [[rne]](3) and the current beatitude of the Longbow.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1582|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=arti_invoke calls mksobj to create arrows}}{{refsrc|src/mkobj.c|803|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=relevant section of mksobj}} A blessed Longbow will only produce arrows with enchantment from 0 to 10; a cursed Longbow will only produce arrows with enchantment from -10 to 0; and an uncursed Longbow will produce arrows in the range of -10 to 10. The probability distribution of the enchantments is not uniform. 

Arrows generated from the blessed or cursed Longbow of Diana are more likely to be +0 than randomly generated blessed or cursed arrows. This is because [[mkobj.c#line362|mksobj]], which [[artifact.c#line11184|arti_invoke]] calls to generate the arrows, can produce arrows of any BUC, regardless of the BUC of the longbow; arti_invoke changes the BUC status of the arrows after [[mkobj.c#line362|mksobj]] returns, bringing negative enchantments on blessed arrows and positive enchantments on cursed arrows to 0.

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Invoke#Optimum invocation schedule|Invoke § Optimum invocation schedule]]''
The Longbow of Diana is generally regarded as one of the more unimpressive chaotic artifacts, and one of the weakest in the game overall. Since the base type of the Longbow is an ordinary bow, it will not provide racial multishot bonuses like the starting bows of non-[[Human (starting race)|human]] Rangers; [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomish]] Rangers in particular use [[crossbow]]s, an entirely different launcher with its own skill.

Furthermore, arrows are often plentiful in the dungeon, either from [[arrow trap]]s or enemy archers, and blessed arrows are very unlikely to break with high [[Luck]]; this makes it unlikely that you will be invoking the artifact often, if at all. Finally, the Longbow must be wielded to convey reflection, and the presence of centaurs throughout the Ranger quest is likely to warrant having a source of reflection prior to entering.

With all the above said, the Longbow's reflection does allow the amulet and shield slots to be used for non-reflection purposes, although you will have to sacrifice either reflection or one of the slots if you want to switch to a melee weapon. The Longbow also provides telepathy while carried, allowing you to more reliably take out non-mindless targets.

==History==
The Longbow of Diana first appears in [[NetHack 3.3.0]] alongside the Ranger role, under the name of '''The Longbow of Artemis'''. It was renamed in [[NetHack 3.3.1]].

==Variants==
Many variants attempt to improve on the Longbow in some manner.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], as of version 5.1.0 the Longbow of Diana gives +1 to multishot and a +1 damage bonus when firing any type of arrow.<ref>https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/blob/master/ChangeLog</ref>

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the Longbow of Diana is a [[silver]]ed bow that grants +1d5 to-hit and +1d6 damage bonuses, with +8 damage per fired arrow; it additionally grants an inherent +1 multishot bonus (+2 for Rangers), and arrows fired from it have no maximum range - this means they will continue flying until they hit a wall or another monster. The invoke effect remains unchanged.

Gnomish Rangers are instead given [[Gnomish Ranger Quest|their own]] [[quest]] and artifact: they fight the [[Great High Shaman of Kurtulmak]] for [[DNetHack artifacts#The Rogue Gear-spirits|The Rogue Gear-spirits]], an artifact crossbow.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], The Longbow of Diana also adds a +d6 damage bonus to arrows fired with it. Bows are also two-handed weapons in EvilHack, meaning that it cannot be wielded while wearing a shield.

Gnomish Rangers share the same quest, but will instead receive [[The Crossbow of Carl]] as an 'alternate' quest artifact: its base item is a crossbow, ensuring that they retain their racial multishot bonus, and it otherwise possesses all the same properties as the Longbow of Diana in that game.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
This legendary bow grants ESP when carried and can reflect magical attacks when wielded.  When invoked it provides a supply of arrows.

'''The Master Key of Thievery''' is the [[Rogue]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Rogue quest]], and is [[chaotic]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its base item type is a [[skeleton key]].

== Effects ==
When carried, the Key confers [[warning]], [[teleport control]] and [[half physical damage]]. Using the Master Key of Thievery for unlocking always succeeds. A Rogue carrying the Key has improved chances to disarm a [[trap]].{{refsrc|trap.c|3020}} [[Invoking]] it removes all traps{{refsrc|artifact.c|1250}} in a door or container. The Master Key will also speak to you and give a random rumor: the rumor will be true if the Key is blessed, false if cursed, and either if uncursed.

Starting in [[3.6.1]], the Key has additional effects, all of which only take place if it's blessed (non-cursed for Rogues).{{reffunc|artifact.c|is_magic_key}} Firstly, locking or unlocking a trapped door or container with the Key automatically detects and offers to remove the trap;{{refsrc|src/lock.c|111|nethack=3.6.1}} this is guaranteed to succeed. In the inventory of a monster, the Key will also untrap any door the monster is trying to open.{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|1260|nethack=3.6.1}} Secondly, untrapping doors and chests manually always succeeds as well.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|4276|nethack=3.6.1}} Finally, wielding the Key without gloves will give you clues about adjacent traps of any kind (it will feel "warm" or "hot").{{reffunc|artifact.c|mkot_trap_warn}}

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Invoke#Optimum invocation schedule|Invoke § Optimum invocation schedule]]''

Half physical damage is a rare property and is very useful, which makes the Master Key a good wish for a chaotic character, particularly considering its low weight. It should be wished for early, because [[Wish#Artifact wishing|artifact wishing]] depends on the number of artifacts in existence already&mdash;in fact, a chaotic character may want to hold back on sacrificing before their first wish, because an artifact wish is only guaranteed if there are 2 or fewer artifacts generated. Also be sure to be able to withstand the [[Artifact blast|blasting]] damage; you need at least 41 HP (21 with [[magic resistance]]). Once the Key is in your inventory, you should avoid dropping it, since picking it up again will blast you another time. Keep a normal skeleton key or [[lockpick]] for mundane unlocking purposes, since applying the Master Key will also blast you.

As with all quest artifacts, cross-aligned characters can only pick up the Master Key via appropriate use of a [[helm of opposite alignment]] (or permanent conversion at an [[altar]]). This is usually not worth the trouble, since non-chaotic adventurers are better off with an artifact that grants magic resistance, and neutrals can obtain half physical damage from [[the Orb of Fate]].

==Encyclopedia entry==

'''The Platinum Yendorian Express Card''' (informally '''PYEC''') is the [[Tourist]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Tourist quest]], and is [[neutral]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its base item type is a [[credit card]].

The Platinum Yendorian Express Card is the only quest [[artifact]] whose name is not of the form ''“The X of [the] Y.”''

==Effects==
When carried, The Platinum Yendorian Express Card confers [[magic resistance]], [[telepathy]] and [[half spell damage]]. [[Invoking]] the Card can [[charge]] objects like a [[scroll of charging]], with different effects based on the Card's beatitude for Tourists; for non-Tourists, the blessed Card only charges like an uncursed scroll.{{refsrc|artifact.c|1265}} Unlike the scroll, the Card has no special effect if it is invoked while you are [[confused]].

==Strategy==
{{main|Invoke#Optimal invocation schedule}}
The Platinum Yendorian Express Card is considered one of the best artifacts in the game due to its unique invoke, incredibly light weight and valuable properties, making it an enticing and somewhat common artifact [[wish]] for neutral players - be sure to wish for it with [[fireproof]]ing! It is a powerful aid when [[altar farming]] using a [[bag of tricks]] or [[wand of create monster]], or [[polypiling]] for certain weapons and/or magical tools; players [[eating jewelry]] tend to use the Card to charge any applicable rings. 

Tourists completing their [[Quest]] are in a particularly good position, as the [[Master of Thieves]] lacks any other resistances beyond [[stoning resistance]] and the magic resistance from picking up the Card. Tourists also get the most out of the artifact by far, and can use blessed charging from the Card's invoke to efficiently recharge their [[wand of wishing]] or [[magic marker]](s) with at least 20 charges left (to try and boost to 75); any other role will normally want to use a blessed scroll of charging for this instead.{{refsrc|read.c|324}} The artifact also grants more mileage from various wands and certain stat-boosting rings, as well as practically-infinite use of charged tools, without using scrolls or marker charges; this makes uncursed charging and [[artifact blast]]s worth dealing with for non-Tourists far more often than not.

With all the above perks in mind, The Platinum Yendorian Express Card is a luxury for neutral non-Tourists (albeit an excellent one): they should prioritize wishes that increase survivability where possible, though lucky players (especially ones that get early wishes) may find themselves with a spare wish that can be spent on the Card if so desired. Any role using the Card should have other sources of magic resistance and telepathy available alongside the Card&mdash;the [[Wizard of Yendor]] can swipe it from you and becomes far more troublesome to deal with if he does, so it is typically a good idea to [[bag]] it during the late game and [[ascension run]].

===Conducts===
[[Neutral]] [[conduct]] play opens up several other considerations for using The Platinum Yendorian Express Card:

* For [[illiterate]] [[conduct]] players, The Platinum Yendorian Express Card is the only method of charging available, particularly for various wands such as the wand of wishing and [[wand of death]].
* Liquid-diet [[foodless]] players may seek the Card in order to sustain their stock of [[nutrition]]-giving [[potion]]s, usually by invoking it to recharge a [[horn of plenty]].
* Pacifists are more reliant on wands than most, and will want to wish for it in order to charge essential wands and other objects, e.g. wands of {{wand of|fire}} and {{wand of|lightning}} for engraving, {{wand of|teleportation}} wands for escaping, and [[The Orb of Fate]] as an unlimited-use [[crystal ball]] that has no risk of exploding (on top of its valuable defensive properties).
* Eating jewelry as mentioned above can overlap with one or more conducts in other ways (e.g., obtaining resistances for pacifists, or boosting AC for [[nudist]]s).

==History==
The Platinum Yendorian Express Card was introduced along with most of the other quest artifacts in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], earlier versions and some variants based on them, the Wizard of Yendor would only steal the quest artifact of your current role, making the Card much safer to carry in open inventory.

==Origin==
The artifact gets its name from the Commodore 64 version of the game ''Wizardry'', whose manual states that players start with limited gold because "few adventurers have a Platinum Yendorian Express Card". The name is based off the [[Wikipedia:American Express#History_of_card_types|American Express]] suite of credit cards - certain types of credit cards are also known as ''charge cards'', hence the artifact's ability when invoked. Somewhat funnily, the [[tiles]] representation of credit cards is modeled after a [[Wikipedia:Mastercard|Mastercard]], which is a credit card but not a charge card.

==Variants==
The Platinum Yendorian Express Card is usually not a rare exception to the “X of [the] Y” rule in variants that introduce other artifacts. More importantly, some 3.4.3-derived variants have the Wizard of Yendor follow that version's for his artifact theft attack.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the charging provided by The Platinum Yendorian Express Card can enable practical long-term use of [[lightsaber]]s for [[Jedi]] and other players that unrestrict the skill via [[crowning]]. Alongside the fact that the Wizard of Yendor follows 3.4.3 rules for his Amulet-stealing attack, the Card is even more enticing as a wishing candidate; however, artifact blast damage is heavily buffed as well, doing up to 8d10 damage (or 6d10 if you have magic resistance).

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, [[SlashTHEM]] introduces another artifact, the [[Gourd of Infinity]], that can be invoked to charge items; this makes the Card somewhat less unique.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], The Platinum Yendorian Express Card is [[silver]]ed, but is otherwise unchanged. Like other quest artifacts in dNetHack, it cannot be obtained by wishing, and can only be found outside the Tourist quest in the appropriate [[bones]]; however, the Wizard of Yendor's Amulet-stealing attack no longer targets quest artifacts, making it a valuable resource for Tourists and a stellar bones find for any other role.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], The Platinum Yendorian Express Card [[object materials|is made of]] actual [[platinum]], but is otherwise unchanged.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], changes to artifact wishing means that wishing for The Platinum Yendorian Express Card will cause a hostile [[Twoflower]] to generate with it. He now has [[sleep resistance]] and [[poison resistance]] like all [[quest leader]]s, alongside the Card's magic resistance - though not especially difficult to defeat compared to other quest leaders, this makes spending a very early wish on the artifact quite a [[bad idea]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
This is an ancient artifact made of an unknown material.  It is rectangular in shape, very thin, and inscribed with unreadable ancient runes.  When carried, it grants the one who carries it ESP, and reduces all spell induced damage done to the carrier by half.  It also protects from magic missile attacks.  Finally, its power is such that when invoked, it can charge other objects.

'''The Orb of Fate''' is the [[Valkyrie]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Valkyrie quest]], and is [[neutral]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its [[base item]] type is a [[crystal ball]].

It is often called the '''Orb of Weight''' by some players, due to its base item's heavy [[weight]] of 150 aum.

==Description==
When carried, the Orb confers [[warning]], [[half spell damage]], [[half physical damage]] and acts as a [[luckstone]]. When [[apply|applied]], it acts as a normal crystal ball. When #[[invoke]]d, it allows the player to [[level teleport]]. 

When [[read]], it gives this message:
  It is signed:  "Odin."

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|For crystal balls in general: You can now search for [[dungeon feature]]s by entering any of [[Staircase|{{white|<}}]] [[Staircase|{{white|>}}]] [[Altar|{{white|_}}]] [[Throne|{{white|\}}]] [[Sink|{{white|#}}]] [[Fountain|{{white|{}}]]. Doing so will find all of these features regardless of which one you entered.

The intelligence check when applying a crystal ball now uses a d8 instead of d20 if it is your own [[quest artifact]], or d16 for other blessed crystal balls.

Crystal balls are now generated with 3-7 charges. Uncursed charging adds 1-2 charges up to the maximum of 7. Blessed charging increases the number of charges to 7 and also blesses the ball. Cursed charging removes all charges and curses the ball.

Applying a [[cancelled]] crystal ball now destroys it, regardless of whether or not it is an artifact.}}

==Strategy==
The Orb of Fate is extremely useful, serving as a crystal ball and luckstone while halving most forms of damage. Despite its weight, the Orb needs to be held in main inventory for you to benefit from its effects. The #invoke effect of level teleportation is useful with [[teleport control]] for speedy travel, and can save you some cursed [[scroll of teleportation|scrolls of teleportation]]. 

Neutral characters may consider the Orb of Fate for an artifact wish after obtaining both [[magic resistance]] and [[reflection]], since the Orb provides no protection against [[instadeath]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The changes for intelligence checks make the Orb viable for use as a crystal ball by Valkyries, allowing it to be applied for reliable detection of the [[vibrating square]] or [[magic portal]]s on the [[Planes]]. This also saves resources that would be spent on writing or obtaining [[scroll of gold detection|scrolls of gold detection]] for cursed/confused readings.}}

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Some say that Odin himself created this ancient crystal ball,
although others argue that Loki created it and forged Odin's
signature on the bottom.  In any case, it is a powerful
artifact.  Anyone who carries it is granted the gift of
warning, and damage, both spell and physical, is partially
absorbed by the orb itself.  When invoked it has the power
to teleport the invoker between levels.

&&%s&& %s Candelabrum of Invocation {145605 2022-04-24T19:03:04Z {4001313 Ardub23} /* Encyclopedia entry */ American spelling of 'encyclopedia', per [[NHW:Style guide]] {{tool

  |appearance=candelabrum
  |cost=5000

}}

The '''Candelabrum of Invocation''' is a [[unique item]] that appears in ''NetHack''. It is one of the three items required to perform the [[invocation ritual]], which in turn is required to access [[Moloch's Sanctum]] and obtain the [[Amulet of Yendor]]. When unidentified, it appears as a '''candelabrum'''.

==Generation==
[[Vlad the Impaler]] holds the Candelabrum at the top level of [[Vlad's Tower|his tower]], located in the midst of [[Gehennom]]. 

==Description==
To use the Candelabrum, you must first attach seven [[candle]]s to it [[apply]]ing those candles while carrying the Candelabrum. You can then light or snuff the attached candles by applying the Candelabrum itself.

When lit, the Candelabrum of Invocation burns as long as the shortest-lived candle you attach to it, but will lose half of its remaining "lifespan" each time you light it anywhere other than on the [[vibrating square]].{{refsrc|src/apply.c|1163|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/apply.c|1103|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} The Candelabrum provides a [[Light source#The Candelabrum|light radius]] slightly larger than an ordinary lamp.

[[Izchak]] refuses to buy the Candelabrum: If the player tries to sell it to him (while not [[deaf]]) before performing the invocation ritual, he advises that the player keep it and attach more candles if necessary.{{refsrc|src/shk.c|2290|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Outside of the Invocation, players looking to utilize [[expert]] [[jumping]] on the [[Astral Plane]] may prefer the Candelabrum's larger light radius - in that event, try to minimize the time the Candelabrum is needlessly lit by snuffing it immediately after the Invocation has been successfully performed.

==History==
The Candelabrum of Invocation first appears in [[NetHack 3.1.0]], alongside the other invocation items.

From 3.1.0 to [[NetHack 3.6.0]], attaching candles to the Candelabrum removes their weight from your inventory and makes them impossible to lose, so there is a small advantage to applying candles right away; the trade off is that you may light the candelabrum by accident. Given how rare the candles are, and that you lose half its remaining life span when you re-light it, it is considered better to bag them separately until the last minute. This was corrected in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Bell, book, and candle}}
The motif of "Bell, Book and Candle" originated as a Catholic ritual of excommunication by anathema, although some works often portrayed in connection with exorcism (e.g., the Terry Pratchett/Neil Gaiman novel ''Good Omens'').

In the NetHack [[source code]], the Candelabrum is sometimes referred to as a menorah, the seven-branched candelabrum of Jewish ritual.<!--should grab a citation for this soon-->

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], a [[magic candle]] attached to the Candelabrum will become an ordinary candle and be consumed. As the magic candle itself is a viable source of permalight for jumping players, the Candelabrum can be safely dropped after the Invocation if you so choose.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|

Mephistopheles: Nay, I know not.  We shall be cursed with bell,
book, and candle.
Faustus: How?  Bell, book, and candle, candle, book, and bell,

'''Moloch's Sanctum''' is a special dungeon level. It is always the lowest dungeon level, the 20th–24th level of [[Gehennom]], and so Dungeon Level 45–53.  To enter it you must perform the [[invocation]]. This is the level that contains the real [[Amulet of Yendor]].  [[Magic mapping]] does not work here, although the only variable in the map is the location of the secret door to the temple.  

The entire level is [[non-teleport level|non-teleport]] and ineligible to leave [[bones]].

The room marked as '''Temple''' is the [[temple]] housing the [[high priest of Moloch]] carrying [[the Amulet of Yendor]]. The entrance to the temple is a [[secret door]] randomly placed on one of the four walls (shown in blue above). The traps surrounding the temple are [[fire trap]]s.

The high priest attending the temple of Moloch has, in addition to his usual priestly accoutrements, the Amulet of Yendor. The courtyard surrounding his temple contains nine [[aligned priest|priests of Moloch]], a [[horned devil]], a [[barbed devil]], an [[erinys]], a [[marilith]], and a [[nalfeshnee]]; in addition to the standard undead in the marked graveyard, the level also contains two random [[lich|L]] and three random [[vampire|V]]. The temple is surrounded by [[fire trap]]s, and a secret door is placed randomly on one wall; there are also two more fire traps, a [[spiked pit]], a [[magic trap]], an [[anti-magic trap]], and a [[sleeping gas trap]] randomly elsewhere on the level. Four pieces of [[armor]], two [[tool]]s, a [[gem]], four [[potion]]s and five [[scroll]]s are randomly located about the level, as well as the usual [[chest]]s in the graveyard. All walls are undiggable. Also, the (marked in purple above) dividing line between the two halves of the level cannot be phased through by polyself into a [[xorn]] or [[earth elemental]].

== Strategy ==
=== Typical methodology ===
Because of the fire traps surrounding the temple it is desirable not to have to pace along each wall '''s'''earching for the door.  If you have any charges remaining in the [[Bell of Opening]], applying it on each wall will identify the door, as will a [[wand of secret door detection]].  In a pinch you could also use a [[stethoscope]], as a single use does not take a turn.

Once inside the temple, the goal is to kill the high priest(ess) as fast as possible and get out.  Once the priest(ess) is killed, attacking monsters is no longer a priority (except for the [[Wizard of Yendor]], should he appear).  For this reason it is handy to have thinned out the crowd in the graveyard before entering the temple.

The priest(ess) will always drop the Amulet of Yendor.  The first thing you want to do upon picking it up is #[[name]] it "Real" or similar, to distinguish it from the fake amulets that may appear with the return of the Wizard.

=== The Sanctum done quick ===

{{todo|In 3.6, levelporting to most spaces on the map is blocked. Additionally, demon lords don't seem interested in warping to the priest to kill them and take the Amulet anymore.}}

The Sanctum is a [[non-teleport level]], but that doesn't prevent you from [[levelport]]ing (either in or out). As soon as you finish the [[Invocation]] you can levelport into the Sanctum. You do not even need to have entered it previously; you'll land somewhere randomly in the level, perhaps even in the temple. Once you grab the [[Amulet of Yendor]] you will not be able to levelport. However, if you quaff a cursed [[potion of gain level]] you can leave the level as quickly as you came into it.

If you must traverse any part of the Sanctum, you should consider [[jumping]]. Using a light source of some kind is helpful because most of the level is unlit.

Even faster is luring [[Asmodeus]] or [[Yeenoghu]] into the Sanctum. Any of the demon princes, as well as the Wizard of Yendor, will teleport to the high priest, fight him for the Amulet, and bring it back to you if successful.  However, [[Juiblex]] and Rodney are not capable of hurting the priest at all, [[Baalzebub]] has an annoying stunning gaze attack, and [[Dispater]], [[Orcus]], and [[Demogorgon]] are all high-level spellcasters, which makes luring them far too dangerous.  [[Geryon]] is not hugely dangerous and is theoretically capable of taking the Amulet, but appears very rarely and is quite slow, making him an impractical choice.  This leaves Asmodeus and Yeenoghu as the best choices for monsters to retrieve the Amulet.

=== The high priest is initially peaceful ===
[[Image:Sanctum.png|thumb|right|280px|Player about to kill the [[high priest]].]]
Using ranged attacks to kill the high priest can be a good idea, but a pitfall waits for the unwary. If you attack the high priest without first entering the temple, it is considered an attack on a peaceful human, and killing him will then incur the penalty for [[murder]]. Be sure, then, that you have entered the temple and that the high priest has said:{{refsrc|priest.c|352}}

 Infidel, you have entered Moloch's Sanctum!  Be gone!

At that point the high priest is hostile and fair game.

=== Things not to do ===
Do not by any means try to convert Moloch's High Altar. If you do, Moloch will zap you with [[lightning]] and a [[wide-angle disintegration beam]], which means [[instadeath]] for nonresistant characters and possibly item loss for resistant ones. It's still possible to summon [[Juiblex]] or other named demons by doing a same-race sacrifice on the High Altar though.

== UnNetHack ==
In [[UnNetHack]], the [[high priest of Moloch]] is replaced by [[Cthulhu]].

The exterior of the Sanctum is lava, the middle choke-point is a pair of [[drawbridge]]s over lava, and there are two [[wand of striking|wands of striking]] randomly placed in the temple half of the level, so players should be careful about crossing the drawbridges.

Recent versions also contain a few [[shambling horror]]s.

To sacrifice, you stand on an [[altar]],{{refsrc|pray.c|1127}} use the '''#offer''' command, and select a fresh [[corpse]] from your inventory or one that is lying on the altar. Unsurprisingly, this breaks the atheist [[conduct]]. The greater the monster's [[difficulty]], the more your god will appreciate it.

If the corpse is a [[cockatrice]] and your hands are bare, you will be [[stoning|stoned]] immediately, even if it wasn't in your inventory.{{refsrc|pray.c|1157}}

Further effects depend on the details of the sacrifice.

==Ordinary sacrifice==
This applies to sacrifices made on your own god's altar that are not of your own race, not a pet, not a unicorn, and not made in the endgame.

If the creature is not an [[acid blob]] and is more than 50 turns old or more than 50 turns out of an icebox, it is rejected: "Nothing happens."{{refsrc|pray.c|1160}}{{refsrc|pray.c|1319}} (Acid blobs never expire for sacrifices, although they will eventually rot away.) Otherwise, the sacrifice is accepted and consumed.

Creatures have a particular sacrifice value usually equal to their [[Monsters (by difficulty)|difficulty]] plus 1.  In some special cases, the value may be negative if the offering displeases your god; see below. Partly eaten corpses normally have their value decreased by roughly the percentage that's been eaten.{{refsrc|pray.c|1164}}{{reffunc|eat.c|eaten_stat}} For lawful or neutral characters, [[undead]] have an extra point of value,{{refsrc|pray.c|1232}} but this is only relevant to [[wraith]]s, since other undead corpses are automatically aged too much to sacrifice them.

{{anchor|Inadequacy}}

;If your god is [[anger|angry]] at you<nowiki>:</nowiki>{{refsrc|pray.c|1418}}
:Their anger is decreased by {{frac|8}} the value of the sacrifice, or if you're chaotic, by {{frac|12}} the value of the sacrifice (chaotic gods are harder to appease).{{refsrc|pray.c|1420}}{{refsrc|pray.c|1147|name=maxvalue}} The decrease in anger is always rounded down. High-difficulty monsters can be hard to find (and even harder to kill) early in the game. For non-chaotic players, a cross-aligned unicorn will also work. A simple rule of thumb is that non-chaotics must sacrifice a [[Monsters (by difficulty)|monster's corpse of difficulty 7]] or greater, and chaotic players must sacrifice a corpse of 11 or greater.
;If your god is not angry at you, but your [[alignment]] is negative<nowiki>:</nowiki>{{refsrc|pray.c|1439|comment=<tt>ugod_is_angry</tt> tests for negative alignment record}}
:Your alignment is increased by the least of three: by the value of the sacrifice,{{refsrc|pray.c|1442}} to zero,{{refsrc|pray.c|1441}} or by 24 points,{{refsrc|pray.c|1440}}<ref name="maxvalue"/> and "You feel partially absolved."{{refsrc|pray.c|1443}}
;If your god is not angry and your alignment is not negative, but your [[prayer timeout]] is greater than zero<nowiki>:</nowiki>{{refsrc|pray.c|1444}}
:Your prayer timeout is decreased by 12.5 times the sacrifice's value (difficulty + 1) if you are lawful or neutral, or {{frac|125|6}} (about 20.8) times its value if you're chaotic, to a minimum of zero.{{refsrc|pray.c|1446}}
:If this decreases your prayer timeout to 0,{{refsrc|pray.c|1455}}{{refsrc|pray.c|1449|name=blesscnt_not_to_zero}} then "You have a feeling of reconciliation"{{refsrc|pray.c|1459}} (if hallucinating, "Overall, there is a smell of fried onions"{{refsrc|pray.c|1457}}) and your base Luck is increased to zero if negative.{{refsrc|pray.c|1460}}
:If your prayer timeout is still not yet zero,<ref name="blesscnt_not_to_zero"/> "You have a hopeful feeling"{{refsrc|pray.c|1453}} (if hallucinating, "You realize the gods are not like you and I"{{refsrc|pray.c|1451}}), your base Luck is increased by one if negative,{{refsrc|pray.c|1454}} and it is not yet safe to pray.
;If none of the above cases applied (i.e. your prayer timeout is zero, your god is not angry and your alignment record is positive)<nowiki>:</nowiki>{{refsrc|pray.c|1463}}
:If your base Luck is not negative and you are at least at [[experience level]] 3, you may receive a {{sa|Gifts|gift}}.{{refsrc|pray.c|1469|name=may_get_gift}} The chance of a gift starts at {{frac|10}} and decreases for each existing gift and artifact in the game.
:If you did ''not'' receive a gift (or were not eligible for one at all),{{refsrc|pray.c|1485}} your base Luck will be increased by about a fifth of the sacrifice value (specifically, {{frac|5|24}}), rounded down.{{refsrc|pray.c|1488}}{{refsrc|you.h|326}}<ref name="maxvalue"/> If your base Luck is still negative after this, it will be set to 0.{{refsrc|pray.c|1489}} If your Luck was changed by this, you will see the message "You glimpse a four-leaf clover at your <feet>."{{refsrc|pray.c|1495}} ("You think something brushed your <feet>." if blind;{{refsrc|pray.c|1492}} "You see crabgrass at your <feet>. A funny thing in a dungeon." if hallucinating and not blind{{refsrc|pray.c|1494}}).

None of the possible effects will ''guarantee'' that you can safely pray; this is because they only affect ''base'' [[Luck]], so a cursed [[luckstone]] may still cause your actual Luck to be negative.

==Gifts==
If your prayer timeout is 0, you have positive alignment, and your god is not angry, you generally have a chance of getting an [[artifact]]. Your [[experience level]] must be at least 3, and your base Luck must be nonnegative.<ref name="may_get_gift"/> If those conditions are met, the chances of your getting an artifact are 1 / (10 + 2 &times; Number of existing artifacts &times; Number of gifts granted by your god).{{refsrc|pray.c|1470}}

If you receive an artifact, you get the message "An object appears at your feet!",{{refsrc|pray.c|1477}} and your god will tell you to "use my gift wisely!"{{refsrc|pray.c|1478}} Your wisdom is exercised,{{refsrc|pray.c|1481}} your prayer timeout is set to [[rnz]](300 + 50 &times; Number of existing artifacts),{{refsrc|pray.c|1480}} and your [[skill]] in using the artifact's type of weapon becomes [[unrestricted]], allowing you to advance to Basic skill level if you could not before.{{refsrc|pray.c|1483}} The artifact will also be made [[erodeproof]]{{refsrc|pray.c|1475}} and set to at least +0;{{refsrc|pray.c|1473}} it will not be cursed.{{refsrc|pray.c|1474}}

Your first gift will be a co-aligned artifact that does not hate your current form, if any such artifacts are available.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|154|version=NetHack 3.6.2|name=alignment}} Some [[role]]s have a guaranteed first sacrifice gift,{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|160|version=NetHack 3.6.2}} which is noted below; its alignment will be adjusted to your starting alignment at the beginning of the game if necessary.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|63|version=NetHack 3.6.2}} However, the requirement that the first gift be co-aligned (with your current alignment) takes precedence over the role-specific selection; so, for example, a Samurai that has converted to Chaotic will receive a chaotic artifact as the first sacrifice gift. Excalibur,{{refsrc|artifact.c|139|name=spfx_nogen}} quest artifacts,<ref name="spfx_nogen"/> and cross-aligned artifacts cannot be gifted.<ref name="alignment"/>

Once a co-aligned artifact has already been given, or if none were able to be given, then unaligned ones also become eligible.{{refsrc|artifact.c|138}}

Lawful gifts:
[[Demonbane]],
[[Grayswandir]],
[[Snickersnee]] ([[Samurai]]),
[[Sunsword]]

Neutral gifts:
[[Cleaver]] ([[Barbarian]]),
[[Giantslayer]],
[[Magicbane]] ([[Wizard]]),
[[Mjollnir]] ([[Valkyrie]]),
[[Vorpal Blade]]

Chaotic gifts:
[[Grimtooth]],
[[Orcrist]],
[[Sting]],
[[Stormbringer]]

Unaligned gifts:
[[Dragonbane]],
[[Fire Brand]],
[[Frost Brand]],
[[Ogresmasher]],
[[Trollsbane]],
[[Werebane]]

==Sacrificing the Amulet of Yendor==

The goal of the game is to offer the [[Amulet of Yendor]] on the co-aligned [[high altar]] on the [[Astral Plane]]. When you do, you [[ascend]] to demigod-hood ('Mortal, thou hast done well!'). This does not take into account whether, or by what means, you have [[convert]]ed your alignment, so a [[helm of opposite alignment]] can be used to quickly ascend at a cross-aligned altar. However, you get a [[score]] multiplier of 2× if you never converted and are still of your starting alignment, or 1.5× if you converted and used a helm to change back.

If you offer the Amulet on a cross-aligned high altar, that altar's god gains dominion over yours and allows you to [[escape]] in celestial disgrace. If you offer the Amulet on the high altar to [[Moloch]] in the [[Sanctum]], Moloch 'mercilessly snuffs out your life', or if you have [[life saving]], disintegrates you into a pile of dust, ignoring disintegration resistance. (If you [[Explore mode|somehow]] survive that, you again escape.)

Offering a [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]] on a high altar gives a penalty of -1 luck and no other effect. However, if the amulet was ''identified'' as a fake, the penalty is instead -3 luck, -1 [[Alignment record|alignment]] and your god getting [[Anger|angry]] by 3.

Offering a real or fake Amulet on a non-high altar does not end the game. If the altar is an unaligned altar in [[Gehennom]], your god gets angry and Moloch [[smite]]s you. Otherwise, if hallucinating, 'You feel homesick'; or if the altar is co-aligned, 'You feel an urge to return to the surface'; otherwise, 'You feel ashamed'.

==Sacrificing creatures of own race==
If the creature you sacrifice is of your own race, you get good effects if you're chaotic and bad effects otherwise. The age of the corpse does not matter, so [[Zombie|zombies]] and [[Mummy|mummies]] will work.

;If you are chaotic<nowiki>:</nowiki>
:You gain five points of alignment.{{refsrc|pray.c|1219}}
:If the altar is chaotic, you gain two points of Luck, and if the altar is unaligned, you lose two points of Luck.{{refsrc|pray.c|1197}} Your Luck is unaffected if the altar is cross-aligned (but the altar will be converted as noted in the cross-aligned altars section below).
;If you are non-chaotic<nowiki>:</nowiki>
:Your [[wisdom]] is abused unless you are polymorphed into a demon.{{refsrc|pray.c|1173}} ("You'll regret this infamous offense!")
:You lose five points of alignment.{{refsrc|pray.c|1214}}
:Your god's anger increases by three.{{refsrc|pray.c|1215}}
:Your Luck decreases by 5.{{refsrc|pray.c|1218}}
:You lose one point of [[wisdom]].{{refsrc|pray.c|1216}} 
:Outside of [[Gehennom]], your god will punish you as for [[pray]]ing too much (depending on the level of anger).{{refsrc|pray.c|1217}}
:If the altar ''is'' chaotic, you'll destroy it and anger any attendant priest.{{refsrc|pray.c|1188}}
;Whether or not you are chaotic<nowiki>:</nowiki>
:If the altar is chaotic or unaligned, a demon may be summoned. This will be a [[demon lords and princes|demon lord]] if one of them hasn't been generated yet, or else a [[major demon]] (which will always be a [[foocubus]] outside Gehennom). The demon will be [[peaceful]] if you are chaotic and hostile otherwise. If a demon is summoned, you are paralyzed with fear for three turns; [[free action]] does not protect against this.{{refsrc|pray.c|1203}}
:If you are polymorphed into a demon, "You find the idea very satisfying."; your [[wisdom]] is exercised.{{refsrc|pray.c|1170}}
:If the altar is lawful or neutral, it will immediately be converted to chaotic (except on the [[Astral Plane]]),{{refsrc|pray.c|1180}} independent of your alignment; if there is a [[aligned priest|priest]] tending the altar, they will be angered.{{refsrc|pray.c|1181}}

The check for same race is done before the check for a former pet and ignores the check for age, so same-race corpses are always fit for sacrifice until they rot away completely. This is just about the only time an undead creature is a valid sacrifice.

Keep in mind that [[werecreature]]s are considered [[Human (monster attribute)|human]], so sacrificing them if your character is human will have the consequences described above.

==Sacrificing pets==
Sacrificing creatures that died while tame{{refsrc|pray.c|1223}} will generally cause you to lose three points of alignment{{refsrc|pray.c|1229}} and gain the [[aggravate monster]] [[intrinsic]] "So this is how you repay loyalty?".{{refsrc|pray.c|1231}} The pet will have a sacrificial value of &minus;1,{{refsrc|pray.c|1230}} so this will only result in the god of the altar being [[anger]]ed;{{refsrc|pray.c|1335|name=negative_value|comment=negative-value sacrifice will anger the altar's god}}{{reffunc|pray.c|gods_upset|name=gods_upset}} the corpse will ''not'' be consumed. Former pets that have [[tameness|gone feral]] no longer count as pets, and may be killed and sacrificed as usual.

==Cross-aligned altars==
[[File:NHC-Altar-Conversion.png|thumb|(Level + 2) / (Level + 8)]]

You can convert cross-aligned altars (but not high altars{{refsrc|pray.c|1325}} and not unaligned altars in [[Gehennom]]) by sacrificing at them.{{refsrc|pray.c|1343}}{{refsrc|pray.c|1346}} If you fail, you will lose 1 [[Luck]]{{refsrc|pray.c|1406}} and abuse [[wisdom]].{{refsrc|pray.c|1407}} If you succeed then you gain 1 [[Luck]]{{refsrc|pray.c|1384}} and the altar becomes coaligned. The chances to convert an altar go up with character level. Converting an altar with a [[aligned priest|priest]] present will cause the priest to attack you.{{refsrc|pray.c|1400}}

The likelihood of converting an altar depends on your experience level; the probability is <math>\textstyle\frac{level + 2}{level + 8}</math>.{{refsrc|pray.c|1380}}

In any case, [[minion]]s may be summoned to protect the altar.{{refsrc|pray.c|1398}}{{refsrc|pray.c|1410}}

When attempting to convert an altar, you will get the message "You sense a conflict between ''<your god>'' and ''<the god of the altar>''." A successful conversion will produce the message "You feel the power of ''<your god>'' increase." A failed one will result in "Unluckily, you feel the power of ''<your god>'' decrease."

A sacrifice with negative value, such as a former pet, will not cause an attempted conversion. Instead, it will anger the altar's god, which will actually ''decrease'' your own god's anger by one.<ref name="negative_value"/><ref name="gods_upset"/> You will still suffer the usual effects of angering a god, including the loss of any divine protection and being smitten by the angry god. The pet corpse is not consumed, so you can cure as much anger as you like.

{{anchor|altar_converts_you}}Attempting to convert an altar while your alignment is negative{{refsrc|pray.c|1346}} (or using a unicorn of your alignment; [[#Sacrificing unicorns|see below]] for details) may convert your alignment to that of the altar,{{refsrc|pray.c|1357}} take away 3 of your Luck{{refsrc|pray.c|1363}} and increase your prayer timeout by 300{{refsrc|pray.c|1364}} ("You have a sudden sense of a new direction"). Changing your alignment by any means resets your alignment record to zero.{{ref|https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/3d1772a13b84e4643c8938010e4dca0931fa0406#diff-9e2fd3234ebdd323dee94c5cb5e8fdd3}}

You can only permanently convert yourself once per game, and only with a non-unaligned altar;{{refsrc|pray.c|1347}} if this happens before you have been admitted to the quest, the game will be [[unwinnable]].

If you try to convert yourself a second time, or you sacrifice on an unaligned altar (e.g., in Gehennom), your sacrifice is rejected, you hear the voice "Suffer, infidel!", get &minus;5 to Luck,{{refsrc|pray.c|1371}} &minus;5 to alignment score,{{refsrc|pray.c|1368}} &minus;2 to wisdom,{{refsrc|pray.c|1372}} +3 to anger,{{refsrc|pray.c|1367}} and, unless in [[Gehennom]], you are punished by your current deity.{{refsrc|pray.c|1373}}

If you sacrifice on cross-aligned high altar, you don't convert it or yourself. Instead, you are attacked by the altar's deity.

As with coaligned altars, if you get a message saying "Nothing happens", then the corpse was too old and, indeed, nothing happened.

==Sacrificing unicorns==
Sacrificing [[unicorn]]s is complicated because the altar's alignment, your alignment, and the unicorn's alignment all factor into the outcome.{{refsrc|pray.c|1235}} A unicorn's alignment is represented by its color. The white is lawful, grey neutral, and black chaotic. The points to remember are:

* Never sacrifice a unicorn on an altar of its own alignment. You lose one point of [[wisdom]]{{refsrc|pray.c|1243}} and the altar's god becomes angry, with the [[Prayer#Possible negative effects of praying|same effect]] as angering that god through prayer.{{refsrc|pray.c|1244}}<ref name="negative_value"/> If the altar is not of your alignment, your god's anger is reduced by one.<ref name="gods_upset"/>
* Never sacrifice a unicorn of your own alignment (certainly not before you have completed the [[Quest]]). This acts as above if the altar is also of your alignment.{{refsrc|pray.c|1293|comment=<tt>unicalign == altaralign</tt> ist tested first}} If the altar is cross-aligned, this will set your alignment score to &minus;1,{{refsrc|pray.c|1257}} which makes your sacrifice convert ''you'' instead of the altar.
* Never sacrifice a unicorn on a [[Altar#High altars|high altar]]. On an altar of your own alignment, this is unnecessary. On an altar of another alignment, this will not convert you or the altar, but only angers the altar's god.{{refsrc|pray.c|1340|version=NetHack 3.6.0|comment=The "try to convert high altar" branch doesn't actually convert anything.}}

Each time you sacrifice a unicorn of a different alignment on your own altar, you get a +5 boost to your [[alignment record|alignment]]{{refsrc|pray.c|1251}} and the message "You feel appropriately {lawful | neutral | chaotic}",{{refsrc|pray.c|1249}} or "You feel you are thoroughly on the right path" if alignment is at maximum.{{refsrc|pray.c|1250}}

The rest of the effects are summarized in the following table:

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], in addition to the usual benefits of sacrifice, you may have wielded and worn items [[bless]]ed by your god, or [[minion|minions]] granted as [[pets]]. The [[bless]]ing effect extends to ''any'' wielded or alternate-wielded item, not just weapons. Additionally, due to the many new artifacts in SLASH'EM, there is much more variation in the types of artifacts you may receive.
