The '''catoblepas''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]]. It possesses a fatal [[gaze]] attack that will kill you immediately if you are not [[undead]], [[blind]], [[magic resistant]], or [[reflection|reflecting]]. 

==Gaze attack==
The gaze attack has a fairly low accuracy: there is a 75% chance that it will miss plus another 66% if you are either invisible or displaced. If you are reflecting and the gaze would have connected, then it will kill the gazer. 

==Generation==
Although the catoblepas is not randomly generated, it ''is'' a valid polymorphable form, so it is perfectly possible for a [[chameleon]] or intelligent monster with a [[wand of polymorph]] or [[polymorph trap]] to suddenly turn into a catoblepas. It is also possible to self polymorph into a catoblepas, but beware of monsters with reflection, as a reflected gaze of death will kill you even if you have reflection yourself.

Strangely, the catoblepas is a unique monster, yet also genocidable.  This is mostly irrelevant, but if you wish for the corpse of one in [[wizard mode]], it will be described as "The catoblepas' corpse" rather than "A catoblepas corpse."
[[Category:SLASH'EM monsters]]

==Mythology==
The Catoblepas is, as in Ethiopia, a mid-sized herbivore with a body of a buffalo and a head of a boar. Its gaze and breath was thought to turn man to stone, or kill them in some way. Due to the weight of its head, it is usually looking downwards.}

'''Pegasus''' is a monster that was first added in [[SLASH'EM]], and also appears in [[EvilHack]].

==Generation==
In SLASH'EM, the peaceful Pegasus will appear when [[Medusa]] is killed in such a way that leaves a corpse; stoning her with her own reflection will not leave a corpse and thus not create Pegasus. Interestingly, while Pegasus is flagged as a unique monster, Medusa can be revived with [[turn undead]] and killed again, creating another Pegasus.

In EvilHack, Pegasus is instead found at the end of the [[Ice Queen's Realm]], being held captive by [[Kathryn the Ice Queen]]. While not flagged as unique, this is the only Pegasus that appears in the game.

==Strategy==
===SLASH'EM===
Pegasus can fly, has very high speed (the same as a [[warhorse]]), and has a decent level, making it an excellent mount. Pegasus is always created peaceful, making it simple to tame if one can cast [[charm monster]].

Like a [[ki-rin]], Pegasus does not eat and thus can go feral when mounted by any role other than a [[knight]]; unlike a ki-rin, he cannot wear amulets such as the [[amulet of reflection]]. A [[Yeoman]] can use the [[calm steed]] technique to increase Pegasus' tameness after each mount in SLASH'EM variants where this technique is functional.

Pegasus will always leave a corpse, provided he isn't [[disintegration|disintegrated]] or killed over [[lava]], providing ample opportunity to revive him. 

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Pegasus}}
Pegasus is a somewhst minor figure in the myth of Medusa and Perseus; he sprang from Medusa's blood after Perseus decapitated her in most versions, reflected by his generation method in SLASH'EM. In EvilHack, there is a crystal chest nearby containing the [[Bag of the Hesperides]], further alluding to the myth.

The '''Rhaumbusun''' is a very dangerous monster if one lacks [[free action]]. They have the ability to use a [[gaze]] attack that will paralyze for d4 turns if you do not possess free action. Reflection does not protect against the gaze, but blindness will. Fortunately, their low level and high AC mean that they are very easy to kill once the paralysis can be negated. They can only be generated in [[Gehennom]], by which time their unusually low difficulty will likely result in them never being randomly generated. They can be created by [[summon nasties]]. There is always a rhaumbusun named Izzy in the [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]] that will turn hostile if you attack [[Black market (SLASH'EM)#One-eyed Sam|One-eyed Sam]].

An '''assault rifle''' is a [[firearm]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is a [[launcher]] that fires [[bullet]]s at a high rate, and is [[one-handed]].

==Generation==
[[Yendorian Army]] [[sergeant]]s have a {{frac|2}} chance of [[Monster starting inventory|generating with an assault rifle]], and [[captain]]s have a {{frac|4}} chance of generating with one.

==Description==
The assault rifle has three modes of fire: automatic mode (which is default), burst mode ({{frac|3}} rate of fire), or single-shot mode. You can [[apply]] an assault rifle to switch between modes.

===Rate of fire===
In fully automatic mode, the assault rifle's rate of fire depends on its enchantment and skill of the user.

==Strategy==
For a character seeking the optimal combination of weight and firepower from a firearm, the assault rifle is one of the best choices. It is one-handed, enabling the use of a shield, and it has a moderate weight at 40 (the same as a [[long sword]]); the rifle is heavier and less accurate than a [[submachine gun]], but has a higher rate of fire and a longer range. The assault rifle is an excellent tool for clearing out monsters in the [[Astral Plane]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}
Assault rifles are a type of select-fire automatic rifle that use intermediate power cartridges.  First emerging during World War II, they became common during the Cold War. Compared to earlier battle rifles and semi-automatic rifles, they traded accuracy at extreme ranges for lighter cartridges (enabling soldiers to carry more rounds) and higher rates of fire.

The iconic AK-47 is an assault rifle, as is the American M16. Most modern armies use an assault rifle as their standard service weapon.

==Generation==

Rifles are found on 50% of (plain) [[soldier]]s.

==Strategy==

Owing to their two-handed nature and low rate of fire, rifles are generally not useful.  They do technically have one of the longest ranges of any firearm (22, only exceeded by the sniper rifle at 25), but it is rare to be shooting at a target more than 10 or so squares away.

==Origin==

The term ''rifle'' refers to a firearm that has had spiral grooves cut in the barrel.  When a bullet is fired, it expands and molds to these grooves, thereby imparting to that bullet a spin which significantly increases its accuracy.  This technology has existed since the early 16th century, but early muzzle-loading rifles were rarely used in a military setting, since they were far slower to load and far more expensive to produce than contemporary smoothbore (non-rifled) muskets.  By the mid-1800s, industrial fabrication processes made rifled barrels practical to mass-produce, while the prior invention of breech-loading firearms meant that rifled weapons were no longer slower to load than their smoothbore cousins.  As a result, the rifle soon became ubiquitous in armies of the time.

Given their appearance on soldiers who also carry weapons such as [[assault rifle]]s and [[grenade]]s, it seems likely the rifles in SLASH'EM are some type of mid-20th century semi-automatic service rifle, such as the M1 Garand.

==Generation==

A +3 sniper rifle is guaranteed to be found on a soldier in [[Grund's Stronghold]]. Otherwise, they are not randomly generated, either on the floor or on members of the [[Yendorian Army]].

==Strategy==

While very accurate, the sniper rifle's low rate of fire and two-handedness make it nearly useless.  It does have a higher monetary value than any other firearm at 4000zm, but by the time one reaches Grund's Stronghold, that amount of gold is not likely to be significant.  While the sniper rifle does have a longer range than any other firearm, this is unlikely to be factor in most games, since it is rare to be firing at targets halfway across the map.

==Origin==

Sniper rifles are specialized weapons designed to be accurate at extremely long ranges in the hands of a skilled sharpshooter.  Some sniper rifles are derived from ordinary service weapons - usually [[assault rifle]]s or semi-automatic [[rifle]]s - while others are designed from the ground up as specialist weapons.  They usually feature accuracy-focused enhancements such as bipods and large scopes.}

==Strategy==
The heavy machine gun is generally not a viable weapon - at 500aum, it weighs the same as a [[loadstone]] and takes up half of a vanilla ''[[NetHack]]'' character's maximum [[carrying capacity]]; even in SlashTHEM, where the maximum is set much higher, its better rate of fire is offset by its weight and bigger [[to-hit]] penalty. [[Submachine gun]]s and [[assault rifle]]s in both games offer a comparable rate of fire with smaller to-hit penalties and less than 1/10th of the heavy machine gun's weight.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}
The term "heavy machine gun" has historically been used to refer to several different classes of weapons. In modern usage, it generally refers to weapons such as the World War I-era M2 Browning - a large weapon weighing approximately 100lbs and intended to be fired by a small crew from a stationary tripod, the Browning is also found mounted on aircraft and tanks.

Note that real-life heavy machine guns actually tend to have a lower rate of fire than their smaller counterparts: their heavy construction instead enables them to fire heavier ammunition, and to fire for longer periods of time without overheating.

==Generation==

Submachine guns are found on 50% of [[soldier]]s and 50% of [[lieutenant]]s, making them the most common firearm.

==Strategy==

Along with the [[assault rifle]], the submachine gun is one of the most practical firearms in SLASH'EM.  It is very light (25), is one-handed, and has a good rate of fire.  A well-enchanted submachine gun combined with a stack of several hundred well-enchanted bullets (use a [[bag of holding]] to store all but two or three dozen of them, stopping to "reload" by taking more out of the bag) is an excellent way to clear a path to the [[high altar]]s on the [[Astral Plane]].

While the submachine gun does have a fairly short range compared to other firearms (10, vs. 20 for an assault rifle), in practice this is rarely an issue - it is rare to want to hit targets beyond that range.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}

Submachine guns were originally developed as a "trench sweeper" during World War I: a small automatic weapon that could deliver a hail of fire in close-quarters fighting in trenches.  They usually fire pistol rounds, and have a magazine that often (but not always) acts as a foregrip.  They typically have a folding buttstock.  An iconic example of a submachine gun is the Heckler & Koch MP5.

While submachine guns saw common use during both World Wars, they have largely been supplanted by assault rifles in modern armies.  They are still used by police and special forces who expect to engage in close-quarters combat, as their size makes them easier to handle than assault rifles in such circumstances, and their low-power rounds are less likely to penetrate walls and cause collateral damage.

==Generation==

Pistols are only found in the starting inventories of some [[Undead Slayer]]s and [[Rogue]]s.  They are not randomly generated, either on the floor or on members of the [[Yendorian Army]].

==Strategy==

While a Rogue or an Undead Slayer might choose to make use of their starting pistol in the early game, it should be swapped out for a [[submachine gun]] or an [[assault rifle]] as soon as one is found: those weapons provide a much higher rate of fire at only marginally more weight.

Enchanting a pistol to +3 or more makes it more likely to fire multiple shots, but in most cases this will not be worth it.  A lucky Rogue who finds a large number of bullets in weapon shops may be able to advance their Firearms skill to Expert and get a multishot bonus that way, however.

==Origin==

As a technical term, the word 'pistol' describes a handgun with its chamber integral to its barrel, most typically a semi-automatic such as the Colt M1911.  In everyday parlance, however, the term is used to describe a wide range of firearms held in a single hand, from tiny derringers up to massive revolvers.  It is not entirely clear what type the pistols in SLASH'EM are, though the tile resembles a semi-automatic.

A '''silver bullet''' is a projectile used in [[firearm]]s in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is identical to a [[bullet]] in most respects, except that it does extra damage against [[silver-hating]] monsters.

==Mechanics==

Silver bullets function identically to silver bullets, except that they also do silver damage to silver-hating monsters.  Similar to [[silver arrow]]s in vanilla NetHack before 3.6.0, they do not do silver damage when wielded against monsters, nor when thrown at them.

==Generation==

Silver bullets are not randomly generated, but may occasionally be found in shops.  Unlike ordinary bullets, they are not found on members of the [[Yendorian army]].

[[Undead slayer]]s will sometimes start with a pistol and a stack of silver bullets.

==Strategy==

Silver bullets are far too rare for long-term use.  However, undead slayers who start with them will definitely want to consider using them against early [[lycanthrope]]s: unlike in vanilla, lycanthropes in their animal form will revert to their human form upon death, meaning that the player often has to kill them several times to banish them permanently.  The high base damage of a bullet combined with the silver damage is very helpful in this situation.

==Origin==

In modern folklore, many stories of [[vampire]]s and [[werewolves]] speak of a silver bullet as being one of the few weapons that can permanently kill these creatures.  From these tales, the term has colloquially come to refer to a seemingly "magic" solution to a difficult problem, such as a cure to a disease.

Real-life experiments with bullets cast from silver have shown them to not be particularly more or less effective than ordinary bullets. The high cost of silver as compared to lead means that they have never been produced in any real volume.

A '''bullet''' is a [[projectile]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is the ammunition used with most [[firearm]]s.

==Generation==

Bullets do not generate randomly.  They may occasionally be found in shops, but by far the most common source is members of the [[Yendorian army]]: all [[soldier]]s and [[lieutenant]]s carry bullets, as do 50% of [[sergeant]]s and [[captain]]s.

Rogues may start with a pistol and a stack of bullets for it.  Undead slayers will start with [[silver bullet]]s instead.

==Mechanics==

Bullets fired from an appropriate firearm always [[mulch]], even when they miss their target or are merely fired at a wall or floor.  Bullets fired upwards from a firearm do not fall back on top of the firer's head.

When thrown without a launcher, bullets are not guaranteed to mulch, but still may do so.  They also will not do their base damage, instead doing a small amount of [[strength]]-dependent damage.  Wielding a bullet produces similar results.

Bullets on the floor or in monsters' inventories will be destroyed if they are subjected to a [[grenade]] explosion.  This does not affect bullets in your inventory, though, even if a grenade you are carrying explodes.

==Strategy==

Bullets fired from a gun do a very high amount of base damage, higher than any other projectile or even melee weapon.  Moreover, firearms such as [[assault rifle]]s and [[submachine gun]]s are capable of firing upwards of five bullets per player action, producing very impressive damage rates.  However, due their always-mulching property, using bullets effectively requires careful planning and collection.

==Origin==

The term ''bullet'' refers to the projectile fired by a gun.  However, the ammunition loaded into a modern firearm is almost always a ''cartridge'': a single unit containing not only a bullet, but also propellant, primer, and a casing to help contain and direct the expanding gas of the gunshot.  Cartridges greatly simplify the loading process, for before their invention, the gunner would be required to load each component separately.  In modern colloquial usage, however, ''bullet'' and ''cartridge'' are often used interchangeably.

In real life, there are many mutually incompatible types of cartridges: the way that a character in SLASH'EM can load the same ammunition into a [[pistol]] as they would into a [[heavy machine gun]] is unrealistic.

Note that while modern scholars refer to small lead projectiles fired by [[sling]]s as sling-bullets, that usage is modern: the term "bullet" originates from late-16th-century France, as a term for cannonball.

A grenade launcher is a [[firearm]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].  As its name suggests, it fires [[grenade]]s.

==Generation==

Grenade launchers may be found on {{frac|4}} of [[Yendorian army]] [[captain]]s.  They are not randomly generated otherwise.

==Mechanics==

Grenade launchers are two-handed and fire [[frag grenade]]s or [[gas grenade]]s.  Apart from giving the player a slightly longer range with their grenades as compared to throwing them, the grenade launcher does not do much. Grenades fired from a launcher do not do any special impact damage, nor are they any more likely to explode on impact than thrown grenades.

===Rate of fire===

In order to fire more than one grenade in a round, a grenade launcher would have to be very highly enchanted. With expert skill, a +9 grenade launcher would fire two grenades with a 1/6 probability.

==Strategy==

Despite their relatively light weight, grenade launchers simply don't do enough to justify carrying one.  Grenades are not terribly powerful weapons to begin with, and grenade launchers do virtually nothing to make them more powerful.  Moreover, their two-handedness makes them inconvenient for most characters to use.

==Origin==

In modern terms, ''grenade launcher'' refers to a device that fires a large-caliber projectile equipped with an explosive warhead. They can be individual units fired in a similar manner to a rifle, or they can be attachments to a more conventional firearm such as an [[assault rifle]].

Notably, the grenades fired by modern grenade launchers are '''not''' hand grenades, unlike in SLASH'EM.  While devices to fire hand grenades have existed in the past, they were never terribly common, and also were more similar to a catapult or a mortar than to SLASH'EM's tile, which appears to depict a standalone grenade launcher similar to an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M79_grenade_launcher M79].

A rocket launcher is a [[firearm]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]]. It is a [[two-handed]] launcher that fires [[rocket]]s, which on top of doing more base damage than any other projectile in the game, also explode for ''3d8'' [[fire]] damage when they hit a target.

==Generation==

[[Captain]]s in the [[Yendorian Army]] have a {{frac|2}} chance of generating with a rocket launcher.

==Rate of fire==

In order to fire more than one rocket in a round, a rocket launcher would have to be enchanted far beyond what is probable. With expert skill, a +15 rocket launcher would fire two rockets with a {{frac|8}} probability.

==Strategy==

Unfortunately, the rocket launcher's extreme weight (750 [[aum]]), along with the extreme weight of its projectiles (200 aum apiece), renders it useless.  Even with no other inventory, a player could only carry a launcher and a single rocket before becoming [[burdened]].  Furthermore, its accuracy is poor, and its damage per turn is considerably less than rapid-fire weapons such as [[assault rifle]]s and [[submachine gun]]s.

==Origin==

Rocket launchers were first used in China as early as the 1200s, and rockets have seen continuous use in warfare ever since.  Based on its tile, the rocket launcher depicted in SLASH'EM appears to be some sort of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_rocket_launcher multiple rocket launcher] system.  This may explain its high weight, given that such devices are usually vehicle-mounted, not man-portable.  A typical shoulder-mounted rocket launcher (the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazooka bazooka] being an iconic example) weighs around 13lb/6kg - roughly twice the weight of an assault rifle, rather than nearly twenty times heavier.

An '''auto shotgun''' is a [[firearm]] found in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is a [[two-handed]] launcher that fires [[shotgun shell]]s at a high rate.

==Generation==

Auto shotguns have a {{frac|2}} chance of generating on [[captain]]s.  They are not generated otherwise.

==Description==

Auto shotguns are two-handed, and weigh somewhat more than normal shotguns (60 vs 35).  They are less accurate than their single-shot brethren, with a +0 accuracy bonus, and share the same range at 3 squares.

Their rate of fire is dependent upon their enchantment and the skill of their user, but even a +0 auto shotgun in the hands of an unskilled user will fire 2 shots per turn.

==Strategy==

Auto shotguns have little practical use.  Most players will not want a two-handed firearm to begin with, and even though shotgun shells are more damaging than [[bullet]]s, the higher rate of fire of a [[submachine gun]] or [[assault rifle]] allows those weapons to do more damage per turn.  Furthermore, shotgun shells are quite rare, especially for characters who don't wish to murder [[shopkeeper]]s.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Automatic shotgun}}

Automatic shotguns are exactly what they sound like, shotguns that are capable of producing automatic fire.  While they are not terribly common, some military units use them as close-range weapons. Compared to ordinary shotguns, they tend to have a shorter range, but are even more likely to hit a close-by target.

A shotgun is a [[firearm]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].  It features high accuracy and damage, but low range and uncommon ammunition.

==Generation==

SLASH'EM shopkeepers are guaranteed to have a shotgun.  They do not generate otherwise.

==Description==

Shotguns are one-handed, and typically fire one shot a time.  A Skilled or Expert character with a highly enchanted shotgun has a chance of firing two or three shots.

Shotguns are very accurate, with a +3 to-hit bonus, and they also fire [[shotgun shell]]s which do more damage than ordinary [[bullet]]s, but they have a very limited range at 3 squares.  Furthermore, the ammunition is rare: it can only be found on shopkeepers and 50% of [[captain]]s, compared to bullets which can be found on most [[Yendorian Army]] members.

==Strategy==

Shotguns can theoretically make powerful early-game weapons with their high damage and accuracy bonus, but a player capable of killing a shopkeeper almost certainly doesn't need one.  Later on, their low rate of fire, low range, and rare ammunition make them impractical to use.

In the hands of a shopkeeper, a shotgun is deadly to new characters, since unlike the [[wand of striking]] that shopkeepers have in vanilla Nethack it cannot be countered by magic resistance.

==Origin==

{{wikipedia}}

Shotguns are ordinarily smoothbore (non-rifled) weapons that fire a large shell, rather than a small bullet.  Usually, this shell is filled with small pellets (called ''shot''), which disperse in an area around their target, rather than hitting a single point.  This makes them useful for hitting small, fast-moving targets, since one does not need a direct hit - this is represented in SLASH'EM by their +3 accuracy bonus.

While real-life shotguns do indeed have less range than other firearms, it is not as exaggerated as it is in SLASH'EM.  Typical shotgun shells are effective to around 35 meters - while the distance covered by a square in Nethack is somewhat ambiguous, by even the most conservative measure 35 meters should translate to at least 10 or 11 squares.

The '''gila monster''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].

==Biology==

Despite its name, it's a real animal, the encyclopedia entry is exact. It's a species of lizards in the south west of the US. It really has a venomous bite.

==Encyclopedia Entry==

{{encyclopedia|	[Gila monsters] are stout-bodied lizards with short legs and a short,
fat tail. They're covered with bright irregular markings, usually
pink, yellow or white, against black or brown scales. They are shy,
retiring creatures unless they're provoked. Then they can be
dangerous because they secrete a neurotoxin -- a poison that
destroys nerve tissue -- from their salivary glands. In humans,
their bite can result in severe pain and even death.

The '''komodo dragon''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].

==Biology==

It's actually a real animal, the biggest lizard in the world. From Indonesia, it's the top predator there, the encyclopedia entry is accurate.

Even the poisons bite is real. His teeth have special indentations that traps small chunks of food. The food rots and high concentrations of bacteria develops in his mouth. The victims die from the bacterial infection that ensures. Even the smell emanating from his mouth is terrible.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|
The people of Komodo call this animal "ora." Elsewhere it is known
as the Komodo Island monitor or more popularly, the Komodo dragon.
Oras can reach 10 feet in length and weigh 300 pounds or more --
particularly after a meal. They are the top predators in their
habitat, feeding on wild boar, deer, water buffalo, dogs, goats,
rats, snakes, birds, other oras, and -- once in a great while --
humans. They hunt by ambush, hiding in the scrub brush along trails
and in the tall grass of the savannas. Despite their lumbering
appearance, oras can move with alarming speed when they want to,
lunging from their hiding places and sprinting toward their
startled victims. They can't sustain a long chase, but often all
they need to subdue their prey is one bite. Oras carry poisonous
bacteria in their mouths so even if they don't immediately catch
their prey, the attack is often fatal. Using their long forked
tongues (oras and other monitor lizards are closely related to
snakes), they track the scent of their prey as the wounded animal
slowly weakens from the infected bite -- a process that can take
several days. When the victim can no longer flee, the ora moves
in for the kill. Oras are voracious eaters. They devour every bit
of their prey -- bones, fur, hooves -- ripping off huge chunks with
their razor-sharp serrated teeth and swallowing the pieces whole.
