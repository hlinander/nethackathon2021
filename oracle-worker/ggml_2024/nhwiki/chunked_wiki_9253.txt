====Early game====
*While Valkyries are arguably the strongest class in Vanilla NetHack, in SLASH'EM the early game is noticeably more difficult; Knights, Samurai, and even Barbarians are probably easier classes for the early game. 

*Instead of a +1 long sword, Valkyries start with a +1 spear. This is partially balanced out by the 5 daggers they also start with, but overall it is a major disadvantage. Spears are considerably weaker than long swords, and you lose the advantage of an easily obtainable Excalibur if lawful. While the spear is still a decent melee weapon, you will have trouble going toe-to-toe with the baby dragons, scrampers, and werepanthers that will start to plague you after you hit level 5 or so, so you will need to round out your fighting strategy with a ranged attack (your starting stack of 5 daggers will come in handy) and probably engrave Elbereth fairly often.

*The weapon practice #technique can be used to discover a weapon's magical enchantment as well as to build skill points. Note however that you will want to BUC test the item first, since you must wield a weapon to use this technique.

*As soon as you find an altar, prioritize sacrificing to get Mjollnir. Instead of 1d24 bonus damage, in SLASH'EM Mjollnir will strike anything it hits for an additional 24 points of electrical damage. Few early game monsters are immune to this, so this becomes an awesomely powerful weapon even into the endgame. If you are lawful, you should also try for Excalibur as soon as you happen upon a long sword (weapon shop, barrow wight, the Rat King, etc.). A Valkyrie two-weaponing with Excalibur and Mjollnir will cruise through the early game and well into them midgame with little difficulty.
**Since exploding wands have the same effects as breaking them in SLASH'EM, Mjollnir becomes a much more dangerous weapon. Aside from one or two emergency wands like digging, and wands of lightning which are immune, don't carry ANY wands outside of containers if you're going to throw Mjollnir. It is also a good idea to avoid using it as a melee weapon against monsters that might be carrying wands, because the explosions will affect you if you are next to them.

*Since you will be throwing daggers so often, getting dagger to expert for the multishot bonus as quickly as possible is an extremely high priority. Use your weapon practice #technique while wielding daggers as much as possible until you reach expert.

*Think twice before putting any skill points into spears, because as soon as you find a katana or long sword you will want to switch to that as your main melee weapon. However, if you have a really hard time finding a better weapon, it might be worth it to advance spears to skilled.

====Post-quest====
Given that the Orb of Fate's critical half physical damage can be superseded by the Hand of Vecna (which also provides hungerless regeneration), you may want to stash this item in your bag to save on carrying capacity, pulling it out only to levelport, or find the portals in the planes in the endgame. The half spell damage and warning can be useful, however, particularly if you do not have extrinsic telepathy.

A good ascension kit for a Valkyrie is: 
* +7 cloak of magic resistance (enchant an elven cloak to +7 and upgrade it)
* +7 gauntlets of power (only Valkyries can safely enchant gauntlets of power this high)
* +5 fireproof speed boots for the extra attacks, jumping boots for the extra movement, water walking boots to be safe from create pool, or +7 elven boots for the extra AC and stealth
* +5 shirt
* greased +5 helm of telepathy or +7 elven leather helm

If lawful and can two-weapon: 
* +7 Excalibur two-weaponed with +7 Mjollnir 
* +5 silver dragon scale mail 
* amulet of life saving or amulet of flying

If neutral and can two-weapon: 
* +7 Fire Brand, Frost Brand, or Vorpal Blade two-weaponed with +7 Mjollnir
* +5 silver dragon scale mail or deep dragon scale mail 
* amulet of lifesaving or amulet of reflection or amulet of drain resistance
* Wield the [[Hand of Vecna]] for drain resistance if necessary

If you cannot two-weapon:
* +7 Mjollnir with another powerful artifact or silver weapon
* +5 deep dragon scale mail
* +5 shield of reflection 
* amulet of life saving or amulet of flying

All other standard SLASH'EM ascension kit items still apply.

Rogues gain the following techniques:
{|class="prettytable"
|'''Level'''
|'''Technique'''
|-
|1
|[[Critical strike]]
|-
|15
|[[Cutthroat]]
|}

==Other abilities==
Rogues can steal gold from monsters with the #[[borrow]] command. This is not terribly useful, as at low levels where gold matters there are much more efficient ways of getting it (e.g. [[credit cloning]] with your [[oilskin sack]]), and the amount of gold stolen is only your level x 25-50. Finally, it has a chance of angering peacefuls, most of whom are dangerous in the early game.

==Strategy==

Try to get the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa (chaotic Necromancer great dagger) if you can, because can drain levels from monsters and gives you magic resistance when carried.

=== Early game ===

The early game for [[SLASH'EM]] rogues is about finding an altar and doing a sac-fest for the [[Bat from Hell]]. Once you have this item, you will be very strong in melee through the end game. Additionally, Rogues start with a lot of gold, which can be used to run the protection racket or buy some decent equipment in [[Minetown]] or the [[Mall]] (though Rogues will pay a markup of 3x the normal rate). Other than that, the early game is played much the same as in Vanilla ... acquire daggers in the [[Gnomish Mines]], advance skill to expert, pummel foes from range as they approach. This is slightly more difficult if you start with the pistol and bullets instead of daggers, but a careful approach to fighting weaker foes should allow you to get a stack of daggers and decent dagger skill relatively quickly. Use a [[scroll of teleportation]] to get out of scrapes, and poison your stack of daggers with your [[potion of sickness]] for maximum effectiveness.

=== Middle game ===

The mid-game is also similar to Vanilla, but since non-[[Lycanthrope (starting race)|lycanthrope]] and non-[[Doppelganger (starting race)|doppelgangers]] rogues can two-weapon, and SLASH'EM allows two-weaponing with artifacts, it's worth trying to get one of the stronger artifact weapons (or a strong non-artifact such as a [[silver saber]], [[silver long sword]], or [[crysknife]]) as a second to use with the bat. [[Doomblade]], [[Serpent's Tongue]], and [[Stormbringer]] are all good choices here, as is the [[Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa]] if you have a [[wish]]. You will also encounter [[Yendorian army]] members in the mid-game, from whom you can and should collect as many [[bullet]]s as possible and enchant up to +7, then keep an [[assault rifle]] or two handy for use in mowing down powerful opponents. Rogues and [[Undead slayer]]s are the only roles that can achieve expert in [[firearm]] skill, which gives a chance of up to two extra shots fired per round. A rogue who is expert in firearms, firing +7 bullets from an assault rifle will fire 5-9 shots per round (average 7) and do 1d20 + 7 damage per hit (average 17.5), for an incredible average of 122.5 damage per round. Using [[silver bullet]]s for special occasions ([[Demogorgon]], etc.) would add an additional 73.5 average damge to that.
{{todo|Does having skilled or expert in firearms give extra damage per hit?}}

=== Late game ===

In the late game, you may want to reverse-[[genocide]] gypsies and wish for a few stacks of [[silver dagger]]s for use in [[Gehennom]]. Thrown weapons can strike from behind as well, so a stack of +7 silver daggers becomes an extremely powerful weapon against the demon princes. Between the bat, your silver daggers, and your assault rifles, you should be nigh-unstoppable in the end game.

A good [[ascension kit]] for a Rogue is:
 +7 [[silver dagger]]s (or [[elven dagger]]s if you don't want to spend the wishes)
 +7 assault rifle and a stash of +7 bullets (you may also want to keep and enchant any silver bullets you find during the game, but these are not worth wishing for)
 +7 [[cloak of magic resistance]] (enchant an [[elven cloak]] to +7 and then [[upgrading objects|upgrade]] it)
 +5 [[gauntlets of dexterity]]
 +5 [[helm of telepathy]] or a +7 [[elven leather helm]]
 One of the following: +5 [[speed boots]], +7 [[elven boots]], +5 [[jumping boots]], or +5 fireproof [[water walking boots]]
If you can two-weapon:
 +7 [[Bat from Hell]] (primary weapon)
 +7 [[Doomblade]] or +7 [[Serpent's Tongue]], +7 [[Frost Brand]], or +7 [[Fire Brand]]
 +7 [[Stormbringer]] for drain resistance
 +5 [[silver dragon scale mail]]
 [[amulet of life saving]] or [[amulet of drain resistance|drain resistance]], or [[amulet of flying|flying]]
If you can't two-weapon:
 +7 [[Bat from Hell]]
 +5 [[shield of reflection]]
 +5 [[deep dragon scale mail]]
 An [[amulet of life saving]] or [[amulet of flying|flying]]

All other ascension kit items apply.

*+0 [[lance]]
*+0 [[plate mail]]
*+0 [[helmet]]

*+0 [[leather gloves]]
*10-20 apples
*10-20 carrots

Knights start with the following techniques:
{|class="prettytable"
|'''Level'''
|'''Technique'''
|-
|1
|[[Turn undead]]
|-
|1
|[[Healing hands]]
|}

==Strategy==

===Early game===
Knights start the game extremely well-equipped and with strength maxed out at 18/**. However, their equipment is very heavy, and they are likely to become burdened quickly unless you swap out the [[plate mail]] and [[large shield]] for some lighter options. Due to the high strength, Knights start the game with a large damage bonus, which makes SLASH'EM's usually challenging early game quite manageable. Additionally, Knights are the only role with reliable access to [[Excalibur]], the [[Valkyrie]]'s long sword having been replaced with a [[spear]]. On the whole, the early game is much the same as in Vanilla; Knights have a strong offense but weak HP growth and other stats (other than strength). Due to [[Excalibur]]'s enhanced strength, Knight is probably the easiest role to play for the early game.

Because corpses become moldy in SLASH'EM, it is much easier to keep the knight's horse fed than in Vanilla. When you are [[Satiated]] or have enough [[food ration]]s, leave corpses lying around rather than eating them, and ensure that you lay corpses out next to each other rather than allowing them to stack. This will allow you to "farm" for fungi, as when you return to previously cleared levels you will find an abundance of [[lichen]], [[red mold]]s, [[brown mold]]s, [[Shrieker|shriekers]], [[black mold]]s, and [[disgusting mold]]s that you can feed to your horse. Lichen corpses in particular can be carried with you indefinitely and fed to your horse later; other fungi will revive from your knapsack.

===Middle game===
In the mid-game, Knights will want to acquire another strong artifact such as [[Grayswandir]], the [[Sword of Justice]], or [[Snickersnee]] for two-weaponing. Additionally, Knights should #[[pray]] or [[sacrifice]] to get [[minion]]s. As early as level 7, they will have access to powerful [[movanic deva]]s; at level 10 they can get more-powerful [[monadic deva]]s, which coupled with a [[magic whistle]], give the knight a powerful retinue that can mow down even powerful foes like [[troll]]s and [[dragon]]s. 

===Late game===
In the later game, SLASH'EM knights do suffer from a distinct disadvantage as compared to Vanilla.  While the [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]] still doubles damage from [[magic missile]], knights cannot gain skill in attack spells.  Combined with armor penalties for wearing any armor, including dragon scale mail, a level 30 knight with maxed out stats (including a +5 [[Helm of brilliance|HoB]]) will have a 57% failure rate for that spell. Removing body armor reduces this penalty to 12%. The only way to get to a 0% failure rate for the spell is a [[robe of power]], which can be found on [[aligned priest]]s or obtained by [[polypiling]], [[upgrading objects|upgrading]], or a [[wish]]. Since robes are [[body armor]] in SLASH'EM, and a [[shield of reflection]] will further interfere with spellcasting, a Knight who uses this strategy will need to rely on an [[amulet of reflection]], wielding [[Nighthorn]], or repeatedly putting on and taking off a shield of reflection to get the valuable [[reflection]] extrinsic. Knights should continue to sacrifice for minions in the late game, as they can get [[ki-rin]]s, [[astral deva]]s, [[archon]]s, [[planetar]]s, and [[solar]]s, the last three of which will clear out hordes of nasties with no effort whatsoever.

A good [[ascension kit]] for a Knight is:
 +7 [[Excalibur]] 
 +7 [[Grayswandir]], +7 [[Sword of Justice]], +7 [[Snickersnee]], +7 [[Frost Brand]], or +7 [[Fire Brand]]
 [[ki-rin]] that has a +5 [[shield of reflection]], an [[amulet of life saving]], +7 [[elven boots]], and +5 gloves (of any kind)
 +7 [[elven boots]] or +5 [[jumping boots]], or +5 fireproof [[water walking boots]]
 +7 [[cloak of magic resistance]]
 +5 [[gauntlets of dexterity]]
If you plan to cast attack spells: 
 [[amulet of reflection]]
 +5 [[robe of power]]
 +5 [[helm of brilliance]]
If you don't plan to cast attack spells:
 [[amulet of life saving]]
 +5 [[silver dragon scale mail]]
 +5 [[helm of telepathy]]
 +7 [[elven leather helm]]

&&%s&& %s Ranger/SLASH'EM {131490 2020-01-26T06:07:48Z {4000978 Aximili} Add category In [[SLASH'EM]], Rangers can be [[Doppelganger (starting race)|doppelgangers]], [[drow]], [[elf|elves]], [[gnome]]s, [[hobbit]]s, [[human]]s, [[Lycanthrope (starting race)|lycanthrope]]s, and [[orc]]s. Elves, gnomes, and hobbits are always [[neutral]], drow, lycanthropes, and orcs are always [[chaotic]], and doppelgangers and humans can be either.

====Starting equipment====
A Ranger begins with the following equipment:
*+1 [[dagger]] ([[elven dagger]] for elves, [[orcish dagger]] for orcs)
*+1 [[bow]] ([[elven bow]] for elves, [[orcish bow]] for orcs)
*50-59 +2 [[arrow]]s ([[elven arrow]]s for elves, [[orcish arrow]]s for orcs)
*30-39 +0 [[arrow]]s (same as above)
*+2 [[cloak of displacement]] (+2 [[elven cloak]] for elves)

====Skills====
{{Ranger skill table}}

====Techniques====
{|class="prettytable"
|'''Level'''
|'''Technique'''
|-
|1
|[[Missile flurry]]
|}

====Strategy====
As in Vanilla, Rangers are weak in melee but very strong in ranged combat. In the early game it is critical to acquire new missile weapons, enchant them, and max out your luck as quickly as possible so that you don't run out of ammunition. Arrows, darts, and daggers are all good candidates for an early ranger to invest in. Elven rangers will have a distinct advantage in the early game because SLASH'EM gives additional [[multishot]] benefits for the elven bow and elven arrows. An elven ranger can have a chance of firing a volley of up to six arrows at a time from his second turn (if he wields his bow on his first turn). Additionally, SLASH'EM gives additional multishot benefits for enchanted bows.

A chaotic ranger has an advantage in sacrifice weapons, having access to powerful gifts like [[Bat from Hell]], [[Doomblade]], [[Serpent's Tongue]], and [[Stormbringer]]. A neutral ranger will have a more difficult time finding a decent melee weapon, as only [[Magicbane]], [[Mjollnir]], and [[Cleaver]] are worth their salt as a main melee weapon of the neutral sacrifice gifts. Thus, a ranger should focus on training bow and either dagger or dart skills and building up a stack of blessed, enchanted arrows and daggers/darts, and use them as his primary weapon until he gets a better alternative such as a [[crysknife]] (much improved over Vanilla). For these reasons it may be worth going straight for the [[luckstone]] at Mine's End before trying sokoban, and any clear potions costing 100 zorkmids should be altar-tested at Minetown and, if blessed, used to bless your main stack of arrows.

Once the ranger has a decent weapon from the midgame on, a ranger plays much like any other role but should continue to rely on ranged attacks. It is better to enchant a stack of (preferably elven) arrows to +7 than to spend the enchantment on a melee weapon, as you will be able to fire up to 6 shots per round with a +7 bow (9 if you are an elf firing elven arrows with a +7 elven bow), with an average damage of 10.5 per hit (double if firing [[silver arrow]]s at silver-haters) plus any applicable strength and skill bonuses. To put this in perspective, an elven ranger, expert in bow, firing +7 elven arrows from a +7 elven bow will fire 4.3 arrows per round, for an average of 3.5 base damage + 7 enchantment bonus + 2 skill bonus = 54 damage per turn. If firing blessed +7 silver arrows from a +7 elven bow at Demogorgon will fire an average of 3.7 arrows per turn, for an average of 3.5 base damage + 7 enchantment bonus + 2 skill bonus + 2.5 blessed bonus + 10.5 silver damage = 93.5 damage per turn. This is comparable with the damage that can be achieved with firearms.

'''NetHack 3.6.2''' is the 32nd public release of [[NetHack]]. It was released on May 7th, 2019. It primarily contains bug fixes for [[NetHack 3.6.1]] with minimal gameplay or interface changes.

== Availability ==
NetHack 3.6.2 is [https://nethack.org/v362/downloads.html available] from the official NetHack website, and continuing the practice from 3.6.1, the Git repository of the source code is available to browse on [http://github.com/nethack/nethack GitHub]. From this repository, anyone can download and build a copy of 3.6.2.

== Online play ==
NetHack 3.6.2 official public release can be played online at [[NAO]], with the option to copy over your rc config file from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2. The [[Hardfought]] build (363-hdf) is keeping with tradition, running the latest bleeding-edge development code released by the [[DevTeam]] - 3.6.3-1 'Beta' (last build Tue Nov 19 23:42:38 2019 UTC - git commit 24ff713).

== Significant changes ==

=== New features ===

* Eating [[spinach]] while having [[sustain ability]] no longer makes you feel like Popeye.
* [[Gold]] created with a grave is now buried under the grave instead of left on top of it.
* Several tweaks to [[status hilites]], including full support of <= and >= operators. < and > now mean "strictly less than" and "strictly greater than", which they did not previously.
* Curses window-port added for Windows, Mac and UNIX.
* The {{spell of|healing}} spell now cures [[blindness]] both in monsters and yourself, but only at Skilled or Expert.
* [[Teleport at will]] now has the same requirements as the [[teleport away]] spell.
* Added the {{kbd|m}} and {{kbd|ctrl|T}} [[wizard mode]] commands, which tests various forms of teleportation.
* [[Drawbridge]]s in the [[Valkyrie quest]] can sometimes be generated raised.
* [[Clairvoyance]] has been improved: among other things, it now shows objects and the location of monsters.

=== Bug fixes ===
* Game no longer complains about the config file not ending in a newline, and will actually parse the last line.
* Spells of healing and extra healing correctly heal untimed monster blindness.
* [[Stone-to-flesh]]ing petrified statues no longer fails if the square is occupied.
* Verbal messages for charming and seduction no longer print while the character is [[deaf]].
* The #turn command, if it aggravated monsters, no longer takes zero turns.
* A number of fixes to address lag and performance problems in the Windows tty port.
* Looking at a remembered [[corpse]] that has since [[rot]]ted away no longer shows a random corpse.
* Several minor fixes to [[shop]] damage repair.
* Groups of monsters generated at [[treasure zoo]]s correctly start asleep now.
* Monsters no longer avoid the [[vibrating square]].
* [[Player monster]]s are not given stacks of [[athame]]s or [[scalpel]]s anymore.

The standard strategy for SpliceHack is very similar to the [[standard strategy]] for playing vanilla NetHack. It is entirely possible to ascend without using any sort of alternate strategy. That being said, the endgame in SpliceHack is dangerous, and there are a number of things you can do to make your journey to ascension that much easier! This guide covers the main differences between the strategy for NetHack ascension and SpliceHack ascension.

== Early game ==
The early game in SpliceHack is extremely similar to vanilla NetHack. The biggest things to watch out for are a few very weak new monsters, such as lemurs and death maggots. Also, try to keep your pets away from porcupines, as this is a good way to lose a companion very early. 

The object materials patch means that you can generally assemble a fairly strong set of equipment. Try to get at least one silver item early on, since it can help you against demons later. Additionally, floating eyes are rarer than in vanilla, so keep an ''eye'' out for one in order to obtain blind telepathy.

== Midgame ==
SpliceHack's midgame is where the differences from vanilla are most apparent. Numerous branches are available to the player, as described in a section below. Many of the new monsters will be encountered in this portion of the game, some of which are very threatening. Make sure to look up the stats of unfamiliar monsters using the colon key to avoid dying to something preventable. Although by no means necessary, it may be a good idea to find some sort of source of sonic resistance (earmuffs from the [[SpliceHack/Special_levels#New_branches|icy wastes]], resonating shields, purple dragon scale mail, Sonicboom) and possibly psychic resistance ([[Item_(SpliceHack)#Armor|helm of mindarmor]], way to become mindless).

SpliceHack has a much larger selection of artifacts, more details about which can be found on the [[Artifact (SpliceHack)|SpliceHack artifacts]] page. Offering at altars can therefore grant you one of many items. Keep in mind that the success of wishing for artifacts in SpliceHack is based on how many artifacts you have been granted or wished for, and does not include those that were randomly generated.

Gehennom is structured slightly differently than vanilla, and you will likely encounter the lairs of at least a few unique demons. When they ask for a bribe, they may ask you for an artifact or offer to play a game of chance with you. Thus, it is a very good idea to keep any spare artifacts or decks of cards in your inventory to ward off potentially deadly encounters.

== Endgame ==
The endgame of SpliceHack is simultaneously calmer and more hectic than vanilla. On one hand, the mysterious force is gone. On the other, performing the ascension ritual spawns all nonexistent major demons on random levels. Warning and telepathy can be invaluable during the ascension run in order to avoid running into any of them around a corner. Move as quickly as possible to minimize your chances of an encounter. If you do run into a major demon, you may be able to use your high speed and that they are not covetous in order to run away.

The Elemental Planes are largely the same as vanilla, although the Plane of Water has a few guaranteed monsters and is slightly harder than in vanilla. The Astral Plane, however, is extremely hectic. A greater number of player monsters spawn here than in vanilla, and unlike vanilla they are capable of stealing the Amulet from you and fleeing. Should any of them manage to make it to a coaligned altar, that's game over. Be very careful around player monsters and kill them from a distance if necessary.

The final difference to be aware of is the Riders. Although their stats are unchanged, each of them rides a unique, high-level horse. While the horses present little threat on their own, they take a few turns to kill, which could be enough time for the Rider to resurrect.

== Pets ==
Pets in SpliceHack are much more valuable than in vanilla, and an effort should be made to keep your pet alive as long as possible. In the early game, pets function largely the same as in vanilla, but can become very powerful in the midgame and late game. Because pets can gain intrinsic resistances from corpses and cast spells, it is very viable to take a pet with you from the start of the dungeon into Gehennom.

Additionally, the intelligent pets patch and addition of new monsters makes the selection of desirable pets much larger. Here are a few of the best monsters to tame:
* '''All useful vanilla pets:''' All pets that were good in vanilla are good choices in SpliceHack.
* '''Archons and other spellcasters:''' Just like in vanilla, Archons are some of the best pets around. Since monsters in SpliceHack can cast spells at one another, they are even more powerful here.
* '''Black dragons:''' Although dragons make for decent pets in vanilla, they are a much more powerful choice in SpliceHack due to pets being able to use breath weapons. Additionally, SpliceHack dragons can drink potions and zap themselves with wands, making them even stronger. Black dragons are especially notable due to their love of disintegrating monsters.
* '''Elder dragons:''' Any of the new dragons introduced in SpliceHack will make an excellent pet. They are very high level, deal large amounts of damage, and have powerful breath weapons and special abilities.
* '''Amalgamations and bad clones:''' Although only a small fraction of amalgamations and bad clones will have a useful selection of attacks, you might find an especially powerful one, such as a "cockatriceblack dragon."
* '''Gnolls:''' Powerful attacks and able to use weapons, these humanoids make great pets, particularly gnoll chieftains.
* '''Hundred handed ones:''' These giants get six weapon attacks per round and have an enormous multishot bonus. Although not terribly useful for most characters, if you have a lot of powerful projectiles to give them they can become absolute powerhouses.

== Wishing ==
* '''All good vanilla [[wish]] targets:''' These are all still excellent choices.
* '''Masks:''' Masks allow for permanent polymorph into a specific form for as long as they are worn, although their BUC status degrades each time they are put on until they crumble. Thus, something such as "blessed mask of a master mind flayer" or "blessed mask of an ooze dragon" can be a great late-game wish.
* '''Scrolls of time:''' Scrolls of time are some of the most valuable items in SpliceHack, and can be used to waltz through parts of the Astral Plane, easily win fights, and escape dangerous situations. Wishing for scrolls of time is a solid choice. A magic marker can also work, but these scrolls have recently been nerfed in both power level and marker ink cost.
* '''Gae Bulg:''' If you can throw and hit an enemy with this artifact, it will deal enough damage to nearly always instantly slay it. This makes it a great artifact to wish for, especially if you have extra wishes and already have an amulet of life saving. Additionally, it is a decent weapon on its own; however, it is destroyed when it is used for its killing throw.
* '''The Holographic Void Lily:''' The [[Cartomancer]] quest artifact yields half spell damage, energy regeneration, and slotless reflection when carried.
* '''Acidfall and Sonicboom:''' These artifacts grant acid and sonic resistance respectively, and both deal damage of the given type. Since these are difficult resistances to obtain normally and few monsters resist them, these artifacts make for extremely powerful weapons, along the lines of Frost Brand.

== Branches ==
All new branches in SpliceHack are completely optional, but a few can be very useful.
* '''[[Black market (SLASH'EM)|One-eyed Sam's Market]]:''' Just like in SLASH'EM and UnNetHack, the black market is a great way to fill out your ascension kit.
* '''Icy Wastes:''' This branch has a relatively easy boss, particularly if you are cold resistant. In addition, it contains a pair of earmuffs so that you can get sonic resistance, and a powerful single-use attack item.
* '''Mysterious Laboratory:''' This branch is very useful for spellcasters, since eating the Ancient Brain will grant a bonus to intelligence and wisdom, and the level contains a number of spellbooks. The enemies here are very tough, however, so exercise caution.

&&%s&& %s The November NetHack Tournament {143590 2021-11-07T17:46:09Z {4001381 Qt} /* Scoring */ 'Scoring' is different in 2021 [[File:TNNTlogo.svg|border|right]]

'''The November NetHack Tournament''', abbreviated as '''TNNT''', is a NetHack [[tournament]] that takes place during the month of November. It has been run every November since 2018. Its main page can be found at [https://tnnt.org/ https://tnnt.org/].

Unlike [[Junethack]], which takes a broader focus on multiple NetHack [[variants]], TNNT focuses primarily on the vanilla game, while still being open and accommodating to all skill levels.

Like Junethack, TNNT is played on [[public server]]s, allowing players on those servers to reuse their existing accounts. Currently the three [[Hardfought]] servers are the only ones on which TNNT is available to be played. Likewise, TNNT supports clans, allowing a group of players to coordinate and pool their accomplishments in a competition for the highest-scoring clan.

Chatting about the tournament happens in the #tnnt channel on the [[Libera]] IRC network.  A bot in the channel announces player deaths and game events during the tournament.

== Scoring ==
The tournament is currently 'scored' solely by tracking ascensions, trophies, and achievements earned by players and clans.

There are 287 "achievements" available as of 2021, each of which is earned within one game by doing some specific task. Some of them commemorate regular milestones in game progression, some require going a little bit out of your way to accomplish, and others only happen in contrived scenarios that would almost never happen normally and may require some setup.

For full details, see [https://tnnt.org/rules the tournament rules page.]

=== History ===

Prior to 2021, TNNT offered very in-depth scoring. At the core, ascensions were worth 50 points each, which could be boosted by conducts, speedrunning, and streaks. Individual and clan trophies earned also contributed points to scoring.

== Gameplay differences ==
TNNT is not purely NetHack 3.6.6; there are a few changes to the game that will gradually continue to expand in future years, but the game will still remain the same as vanilla at its core. Fundamental game mechanics will stay the same - weapons and armor stats and properties, roles and races, spells and their effects and levels, monster abilities and behavior, so on and so forth. The changes that players will see and experience are in the way of ''optional'' custom content and/or branch levels added to the game, without changing the mechanics or usability of existing content.

===2018===

{{main|Swap chest|DevTeam Office}}

For 2018, the new gameplay content added is a "[[swap chest]]", which allows players to exchange a limited amount of items between games that other players can use, as well as a small purely optional [[DevTeam Office|branch-level quest]] that involves a few members of the [[DevTeam]].

===2019===

{{main|Deathmatch}}

For 2019, another optional quest was added: the [[deathmatch]], which challenges [[you]] to fight a [[player monster]] representing a previously [[ascended]] character, for a reward of a single object of your choice from their final inventory.

The following official [[conducts]] were also added:

* '''Survivor''', never having your life saved using an [[amulet of life saving]].
* '''Swap-chestless''', never removing an object from a swap chest. Placing objects in is not restricted.
* '''Never allowed the [[quest nemesis]] to die'''
* '''Never allowed [[Vlad]] to die'''
* '''Never allowed the [[Wizard of Yendor|Wizard]] to die'''
* '''Never allowed a [[high priest]] to die'''
* '''Never allowed a [[Rider]] to die'''
* '''Artifactless''': never touching an [[artifact]].
* '''Petless''', activated by setting <code>OPTIONS=pettype:none</code> and never having a [[pet]]. If you reach the [[Astral Plane]] with this conduct intact and would receive a guardian [[Angel]], it will not be tamed.
* '''Permanent [[deafness]]''', activated by setting <code>OPTIONS=deaf</code>, and makes the character permanently deaf. This can make the quest challenging to complete if the leader starts roaming, as you cannot [[chat]] to them. It's not impossible, however: the quest leader will still speak to you if you corner them in a corridor or other spot where they have nowhere to move, or if you throw the quest artifact to them.  Similarly, the dev team's quest is never unwinnable, as you can complete it by throwing the scrolls to Mike Stephenson.
* '''Permanent [[hallucination]]''', activated by setting <code>OPTIONS=hallucinating</code>, and makes the character permanently hallucinating. Wielding [[Grayswandir]] ends your hallucination and breaks the conduct.

== Helpful tips ==
=== Convenience features ===
The '''#achievements''' command allows you to look at achievements that you have or have not earned yet in this game.

The '''#tnntstats''' command allows you to check the progress of achievements that require doing things multiple times or doing a set of different things.

The '''#snacks''' command allows you to see types of food you have and have not eaten yet this game, for the achievements that rely on eating a lot of types of food.

The '''#species''' command allows you to view all of the eligible monster species you have killed or not killed, for achievements that rely on what types of monsters have been killed.

The '''#conduct''' command is not new, but it does show TNNT-specific conducts.

=== Swap chest ===
{{main|swap chest}}
The swap chest will refuse to accept certain items. For convenience, a general list of its rules is:
* No [[invocation item]]s or the [[Amulet of Yendor]] (they can't be confined in such trappings anyway.) No [[fake Amulet of Yendor|fake Amulets of Yendor]] either.
* No [[artifact]]s.

* All non-cursed [[ring]]s.

* All [[wand]]s, ''except'':
** No [[wand of wishing|wands of wishing]].
** No [[wand of nothing|wands of nothing]].
** No wands that have zero charges.

* All non-cursed [[amulets]], ''except'':
** No [[amulet of strangulation|amulets of strangulation]].
** No [[amulet of restful sleep|amulets of restful sleep]].

* All magical [[potion]]s, and [[holy water|holy]] and [[unholy water|unholy]] water. (Non-magical potions like [[fruit juice]] and regular [[potion of water|water]] are rejected.)

* All tools, ''except'':
** No [[magic lamp]]s.
** No containers containing other items.
** No [[expensive camera]]s, [[tinning kit]]s, and [[magic marker]]s with 10 or fewer charges.
** No other chargeable tools that have zero charges.
** Most non-magical tools. (Currently allowed non-magical tools are [[oilskin sack]]s, cameras, tinning kits, and [[stethoscope]]s.)

* All non-cursed [[weapon]]s, ''except'':
** No non-silver weapons that are less than +3.

* All non-cursed [[armor]], ''except'':
** No [[dunce cap]]s, [[fumble boots]], or [[gauntlets of fumbling]].
** No non-magical, non-dragon-scale armor that is less than +3.

* All non-cursed [[spellbook]]s, ''except'':
** No spellbooks of [[spellbook of blank paper|blank paper]] or [[novel]]s.
** No spellbooks which have less than two "study charges" left in them (one read away from becoming too faint to read anymore).

* All magical [[scroll]]s, ''except'':
** No scrolls of [[scroll of amnesia|amnesia]] or [[scroll of punishment|punishment]].

* Tins of [[spinach]], lumps of [[royal jelly]], and sprigs of [[wolfsbane]]. No other food is accepted.

* No [[gold]].
* No [[gems]].
* Nothing from any other object classes (boulders, statues, iron chains).

== History ==
In 2016 and prior years going all the way back to the early 2000s, the [[:/dev/null/nethack tournament]] was run each November. However, in 2017, after the release of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the devnull organizer krystal announced that the tournament would be shutting down permanently. Several players coordinated with the hardfought server admins to quickly put together [[Devnull Tribute|a one-off tribute tournament]], which was held in November 2017; but the expectation was that in subsequent years some new tournament would be developed to take its place, which ended up becoming TNNT.

TNNT is not trying to reproduce the system or unique challenges offered by devnull, and has instead been designed from the ground up.

'''Dirge''' is an intelligent [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[SporkHack]] and [[EvilHack]]. It is [[chaotic]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[long sword]].

==Generation==
Chaotic knights who [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|sacrifice a member of their own race]] on a chaotic altar while wielding a long sword will have it turned into Dirge. It can also be given to chaotic characters as a [[sacrifice gift]].

==Effects==
===Sporkhack===
Dirge has +5 to-hit and is permanently poisoned: it deals an extra 1d6 of damage as all poisoned weapons do, but also doubles the base ''and'' enchantment damage against non-poison resistant monsters, resulting in incredible amounts of damage versus the right targets.

====Average damage calculation====
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s. It also does not include the 10% chance to instantly kill non-poison resistant monsters.

When fully enchanted, to non-poison resistant creatures it deals almost as much damage as a fully enchanted Graywswandir versus silver-hating creatures.

|}

===EvilHack===
In EvilHack, Dirge is now acidic instead of poisonous, and is made of [[mithril]]. It trades the ability to instantly kill monsters for the ability to deal double acid damage versus non-acid resistant monsters, and also grants [[acid resistance]] when wielded. 

The sword used to create Dirge can be a normal long sword, elven long sword, or orcish long sword. However, the latter will be converted to a normal mithril long sword when Dirge is created regardless. Any object properties will be removed, the sword will be blessed, repaired, and set erodeproof, and the enchantment will be set to 0 if it was below 0. You must also be a chaotic knight in good standing ([[alignment record]] above 0 and deity not [[angry]]) and permanently chaotic - a helm of opposite alignment will not work.

== Converting an altar ==

{{main|Sacrifice#Cross-aligned altars}}

If you make a normal sacrifice on a non-coaligned non-high altar outside of Gehennom while your [[alignment record]] is not negative, there is a chance that you will convert the altar to your alignment. (The altar to Moloch in [[Orcish Town]] can also be converted.) A [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|same-race sacrifice]] on a lawful or neutral altar is also guaranteed to convert it to chaotic.

== Converting yourself ==

You can change your alignment by the following methods:

* Put on a [[helm of opposite alignment]]. Lawful characters will become chaotic, and vice versa. Neutral characters will become lawful or chaotic, depending on the individual helm being worn. This change lasts until you remove (or [[Scroll of destroy armor|destroy]]) the helm, though this is complicated by the fact that the helm will [[autocurse]].
* Sacrifice on a cross-aligned altar while your alignment record is negative, or sacrifice a co-aligned [[unicorn]] on a cross-aligned altar. You will ''permanently'' become the alignment of the altar. You can only convert yourself this way once per game, and if done before you are admitted to your [[quest]] it will make the game [[unwinnable]]. You cannot become [[unaligned]], and this is the only way to convert to neutral.

By converting yourself, you can pick up an opposite-aligned [[quest artifact]] that would normally evade your grasp, and continue to hold the artifact if you then change alignment again while holding it, as long as you do not drop the artifact or put it into a container. You can also [[ascend]] at a cross-aligned high altar by converting your alignment, though you will miss out on a [[score]] multiplier for ascending with your starting alignment. You cannot be admitted to your [[quest]] after converting or while wearing a helm of opposite alignment.

Walking near a monster without [[stealth]] can also wake it up.{{reffunc|monmove.c|disturb}} The monster must be in line of sight and within 10 squares; without [[aggravate monster]] there's only a 14% chance per monster move of it waking up.  While this is presumably caused by you "making noise", it differs from above events in that the effect is continuous and is applied to each monster separately.

I've tentatively changed the timeline, for one main reason: previously, it was looking like SLASHTHEM was an actual successor of SLASH'EM Extended (hereby shortened to SLEX) when it really isn't. Sure, SLASHTHEM was based on an old version of SLEX, so it is technically a variant, but not only did it not pull any of SLEX's later changes at all, it also systematically reverted at least 90% of the SLEX-specific stuff. I don't have exact numbers, but both from watching the project's github commits and from actual gameplay it feels like it's rather similar to regular SLASH'EM, while (as of the time of this writing) its differences to SLEX are huge. Also, I talked to Soviet5lo about this back in 2016(?) (can't remember the exact date) and he also said he no longer considers SLASHTHEM to be a variant of SLEX. So I edited the timeline to show that both SLEX and SLASHTHEM are variants of SLASH'EM. If there is disagreement with this change, feel free to revert/discuss! --[[User:Bluescreenofdeath|Bluescreenofdeath]] ([[User talk:Bluescreenofdeath|talk]]) 11:21, 3 December 2018 (UTC)
:Apparently there is indeed disagreement with my change, sadly. I find it really weird that a variant that is no longer actively developed, and reverted 90% of the changes its supposedly "ancestor" variant did, would be put to the right of its ancestor because IMHO that's not how a timeline works; the one that was updated more recently (which is very clearly SLEX in this case) should appear to the right. If only we could summon Soviet5lo here and ask him what he thinks would be most appropriate... --[[User:Bluescreenofdeath|Bluescreenofdeath]] ([[User talk:Bluescreenofdeath|talk]]) 21:10, 16 October 2019 (UTC)
::I think the rationale is simply that SLASHTHEM is a derivative of SLEX, not of SLASH'EM, even if much of the way it was derived was to revert SLEX changes. Its github page still says "SlashTHEM is a fork of Slash'EM Extended version 75"; I realise this is a bit unsatisfactory since it's not been actively developed for 4 years. [[User:Pinkbeast|Pinkbeast]] ([[User talk:Pinkbeast|talk]]) 21:15, 16 October 2019 (UTC)
:::If we could edit the template to show that slashthem branched off of slex 0.75 and slex has since been continued to reach version 2.56 or whatever the recent version is, that would probably be more accurate? --[[User:Bluescreenofdeath|Bluescreenofdeath]] ([[User talk:Bluescreenofdeath|talk]]) 21:17, 16 October 2019 (UTC)

== Chronology updates ==

Any wiki syntax wizards around?  I'm trying to update this to show the chronology better.  I ended up with this:

But it's not quite right; it should show nethack 3.3 as an input of both slashem 0.0.1-0.0.5 and nethack 3.4

That is, it should look like this, but with the two 'NetHack 3.3's merged:

The system-wide configuration file, ''sysconf'', is a plain text-file, usually in the same directory as NetHack binary, and it allows the system admin to change some settings compiled into the game. Only available if NetHack was compiled with [[Compile-time options|SYSCF]].

sysconf can also be used to set defaults for config [[options]].

File format is the same as the options file.

==Settings==

===WIZARDS===
Which users can use debug mode (aka wizard mode; accessed via '-D' command
line flag or <tt>OPTIONS=playmode:debug</tt> in the runtime [[options]] config file).
A value of * allows anyone to enter debugging mode.
 WIZARDS=root games

===EXPLORERS===
Which users can use explore mode (aka discover mode; accessed via '-X'
command line flag or <tt>OPTIONS=playmode:explore</tt> in runtime [[options]] file or
via #exploremode command during normal play).  Same syntax as WIZARDS.
 EXPLORERS=*

===SHELLERS===
Users allowed to use the '!' (shell escape) and '^Z' (suspend process)
commands to temporarily leave the game and enter a shell process.
Uses the same syntax as the WIZARDS and EXPLORERS options.

===GENERICUSERS===
If the user name is found in this list, prompt for username instead.
Uses the same syntax as the WIZARDS option above.
A public server should probably disable this.
 GENERICUSERS=play player game games nethack nethacker

===CHECK_PLNAME===
Use the player name for matching WIZARDS, EXPLORERS and SHELLERS, instead of the user's login name.
 CHECK_PLNAME=1

===MAXPLAYERS===
Limit the number of simultaneous games. Valid values are 0-25.
Commenting this out or setting the value to 0 constructs lock files with UID and playername, so each user may have one game at a time, but number of different players is not limited.
 MAXPLAYERS=10

===SUPPORT===
If not null, added to string "To get local support, " in the support information help.
 SUPPORT=call Izchak at extension 42.

===RECOVER===
If not null, displayed at the end of a panic-save sequence.
 RECOVER=Run the recover program.

===SEDUCE===
Make succubi and incubi to use nymphs' charm behavior rather than their own seduce behavior.
 SEDUCE=0

===CHECK_SAVE_UID===
Disable savefile UID checking.
 CHECK_SAVE_UID=0

===PERSMAX===
High score file: maximum entries for one person.
 PERSMAX=10

===ENTRYMAX===
High score file: maximum number of entries.
 ENTRYMAX=100

===POINTSMIN===
High score file: minimum points to get an entry.
 POINTSMIN=1

===PERS_IS_UID===
High score file: Determine identity of "person" with name (0) or numeric (1) user id.
 PERS_IS_UID=1

===DEBUGFILES===
Show debugging information originating from these source files.
Use '*' for all, or list source files separated by spaces.
Only available if game has been compiled with [[Compile-time options|DEBUG]], and can be overridden via DEBUGFILES environment variable.
 DEBUGFILES=*

===DUMPLOGFILE===
Save end of game dump log to this file. Only available if NetHack was compiled with [[Compile-time options|DUMPLOG]]. Allows following placeholders:
{|

|literal '%'
|-
|%v
|version (eg. "3.6.1-0")

===BONES_POOLS===
Number of bones file pools. The pool you belong to is determined at game start. You will load and save bones only from that pool.
Generally useful for public servers only. Changing this might make existing bones inaccessible. Disabled by setting to 0, or commenting out.
 BONES_POOLS=10}

A '''skull''' is, in [[SporkHack]], an item that may be left behind in a [[bones]] pile when a bones file is created. It may also be generated in a sealed [[closet]] instead of a human corpse. Skulls from bones piles will carry the name of the dead adventurer, and cannot be renamed. They are made out of [[bone]].

In a bones pile, the skull does not replace the previous adventurer's corpse, and is only dropped 2/3 of the time. It never drops if the player is in a form that is unsolid or headless.

Skulls do not do anything on their own; they seem to be just a keepsake.

* Don't just tack the information onto the end of a paragraph saying "in X new version, it works like this", or saying "in versions before X, it worked like this". The article should describe the behavior in the current release, and should not have to make any qualifying statements about functionality in different versions.

This template is for creating an infobox that provides brief important information about a [[variant]] of NetHack. Use it like this:

The "lastupdate" parameter is optional, and is used to record the last date that variant received an update. This is intended mostly for stale variants and patches that aren't actively developed and haven't seen an update in a while. Putting these dates on active variants will just make the page content be out-of-date a lot more often.

There is also an "unmaintained" parameter not shown here; setting <tt>unmaintained=True</tt> will make the infobox show "formerly maintained by" instead of "maintained by".

'''EvilHack''' is a [[variant]] initially based on [[NetHack 3.6.2]], created by Keith Simpson (also known as [[User:K2]]). Work on EvilHack began on October 20th 2018, and it was released for public play in April of 2019 on the [[Hardfought]] public NetHack servers. The Github repository for EvilHack can be found at [https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack]; a direct link to the change log can be found [https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md here], and is updated on a regular basis. The latest build of EvilHack incorporates the official release build of [[NetHack 3.6.6]] as well as several bugfixes from [[NetHack 3.7.0]] (EvilHack version 0.8.1-0 Beta - last build Sun Feb 12 06:37:24 2023 UTC - git commit a60d231). To download the official release (version 0.8.1), which includes Windows binaries, visit [https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/releases this link].

== About ==
EvilHack was designed from the outset to be a much more difficult game to win than vanilla NetHack. The inspiration for this game mainly comes from the variants [[GruntHack]] and [[SporkHack]], incorporating many of the same features that make those variants difficult in their own right. Some of those features have remained the same (for example, SporkHack's reflection changes), but many have been altered to set them apart and provide the player with a new experience. Elements from other variants have been included as well, such as from [[dNetHack]], [[Slash'EM]], [[SpliceHack]], [[UnNetHack]], and [[xNetHack]]. There is also a significant amount of custom content that has been developed that is not found in any other variant. In the near future, much more custom content will be added, mainly in the way of optional branch quests.

It is not impossible to ascend EvilHack (there have been many ascensions, summarized at [https://nethackscoreboard.org/zscore.evil.html this page] on the [[NetHack Scoreboard]]), but there are several aspects of this game that the player might take for granted from vanilla NetHack that can easily end a promising run. In general, monsters are tougher and have more hit points, they can fight more intelligently, and they can and will use a variety of items and spells against you that previously only the player could use. Players that lean heavily on using [[Elbereth]] will need to re-think their strategy, especially during the early game. Some improvements have been made for the player as well, so there is an attempt at balancing game play, but overall, this variant will be a significant challenge for even the seasoned player.

=== Design Philosophy ===
As stated before, the overall design goal for EvilHack is that it's a more difficult and challenging game than vanilla NetHack or other variants, without sacrificing game balance or (most importantly) the game's fun-factor.

In short:

* EvilHack is meant to be very difficult and challenging.
* EvilHack is meant to be fun, even though it is difficult.
* Any changes should be balanced.
