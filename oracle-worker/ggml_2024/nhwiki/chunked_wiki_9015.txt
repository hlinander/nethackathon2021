==Mythology==
The xan is based on a mythical Mayan mosquito from [[wikipedia:Popol Vuh|Popol Vuh]], a Mayan book.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito, "go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...
 
The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he knew the names of all twelve.

The '''mad scientist''', {{magenta|Q}}, is a [[defunct features|defunct]] [[NetHack]] [[monster]], appearing between versions [[NetHack 3.0.0|3.0.0]] and [[NetHack 3.0.6|3.0.6]].

&&%s&& %s Aggravate monster {142145 2021-08-22T16:08:53Z {4001483 Cathartes} split content about the monster spell to [[aggravate]] {{otheruses|the property|the monster spell and effect|aggravate}}

The '''aggravate monster''' [[property]] greatly amplifies the chance that nearby [[sleep]]ing [[monster]]s will be awakened if you move near them. While you have this property, monsters can usually tell where you are even if they cannot see you. Also, abusing pets will halve their [[tameness]] instead of reducing it by one.

==Gaining the property==
'''Aggravate monster''' can be gained as an [[extrinsic]] property by wearing a [[ring of aggravate monster]], and as a permanent [[intrinsic]] property by doing any of the following:
*eating any [[cat]] or [[dog]] corpse (or their less or more grown up forms), unless you are an orc or caveperson (then it is harmless)
*[[sacrifice|sacrificing]] a former pet, if it died while it was tame ("So this is how you repay loyalty?"). If the pet went feral (peaceful or hostile) and then died, sacrificing it is okay.
*eating a corpse of your own race ([[cannibalism]]), unless you are an orc or caveperson
*eating a ring of aggravate monster
The effect of aggravate monster is almost completely nullified by [[stealth]].

While extrinsic aggravate monster can be eliminated by simply removing the ring, the intrinsic property is very difficult to get rid of.  The only way to do so is to have a [[gremlin]] steal it from you at [[night]] or eat [[disenchanter]] corpses.  However, be warned that you are likely to lose a number of good intrinsics before losing the bad one--in most cases, as long as you have stealth, it is better to just finish the game with aggravate monster.

The '''shrieker''' is a [[monster]] in [[NetHack]]. While it has no attacks and moves very slowly, its shriek can [[aggravate]] monsters and has a 10% chance{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2432|nethack=3.6.0}}) to summon a random monster somewhere on the level. The summoned monster has a {{frac|13}} chance{{refsrc|src/mon.c|2433|nethack=3.6.0}} of being a [[purple worm]]; the explanation given for this is that purple worms enjoy consuming shriekers and are attracted by their shriek.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1391|nethack=3.6.0}} [[Chat|#Chatting]] with a shrieker will also cause it to shriek; this aggravates monsters, but cannot summon any.{{refsrc|src/sounds.c|710|nethack=3.6.0}} The shrieker corpse also gives a 20% chance of [[poison resistance]], and is safe to eat (unless they are rotten); further, as the shrieker is considered a [[fungus]], consuming a shrieker corpse does not break the [[vegan]] or [[vegetarian]] conducts.

The line "The shrieker shrieks." has gained a reputation as being one of the most memorable lines in [[NetHack]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Baby purple worms now appear in place of adult purple worms when the latter would be out of depth.}}

==Generation==
Some shriekers are guaranteed on the last level of the [[Caveman_quest#Tiamat.27s_Chamber|Caveman Quest]].

==Origin==
According to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', the shrieker is a large purple fungus.

==SLASH'EM==
Shriekers in [[SLASH'EM]], like all {{white|F}} except [[lichen]]s, may rise from the dead. Additionally, they are incapable of summoning purple worms{{refsrc|mon.c|2357|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} but are slightly more likely to summon a monster with a shriek ({{frac|8}} chance instead of {{frac|10}}). The first change may be because two other monsters, the [[squealer]] and the [[mobat]], have the same shriek in SLASH'EM. Shriekers are also immune to death rays.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
With a single, savage thrust of her spear, the warrior-woman
impaled the fungus, silencing it.  However, it was too late:
the alarm had been raised[...]
Suddenly, a large, dark shape rose from the abyss before them,
its fetid bulk looming overhead...The monster was some kind of
great dark worm, but that was about all they were sure of.

&&%s&& %s Engulfing {133338 2020-04-09T05:12:02Z {4000681 Andrio Celos} /* Escape */ Juiblex vs. digging magic An '''engulfing''' attack is one which involves you being caught ''inside'' a [[monster]], whether by being swallowed whole (for example, by a [[purple worm]] or [[trapper]]) or by simply being drawn into a nonsolid or amorphous monster such as a [[vortex]].  Each turn you are inside the monster, you will take damage of some kind.

Engulfing is an attack type rather than a damage type.  The type of damage caused depends on the monster doing the attack.

==Engulfers==

Monsters with engulfing attacks can be divided into three general categories:
* '''Whirlies''': [[Unsolid]] monsters composed of a single element, which attack by drawing you inside and exposing you to their constituent element.  All of these monsters share the ''[[whirly]]'' [[monster attribute]]. The [[air elemental]] and all [[vortex|vortices]] are whirly engulfers.  Vortices (such as the [[fog cloud]] or [[dust vortex]]) are likely to be the first engulfing monsters you encounter in the [[Dungeons of Doom]].  They vary widely in their composition and attacks, so they range from being fairly harmless to being a nuisance even to experienced adventurers.

* '''Blobs''': [[Amorphous]] monsters that can absorb you.  The [[ochre jelly]] and the [[demon lord]] [[Juiblex]] belong to this category, having acidic and [[illness]]-causing engulfing attacks, respectively.

* '''Digesters''': Living monsters that swallow and attempt to digest you.  [[Digestion]] is a special damage type that can [[instakill]] you if you do not escape the monster's digestive system in time.

==Gameplay while engulfed==

Any directional [[spell]] cast while engulfed will always hit the engulfing monster ("The <spell> rips into the <monster>!").  [[Ray]]-based attacks do not travel beyond the confines of the monster. Also, any melee attacks on a monster engulfing you will always hit.

You may not [[engrave]] while engulfed,{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|498|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} although trying may elicit [[YAFM|a humourous reply]].

==Escape==
There are a variety of ways of escaping an engulfing monster, but some are only applicable to certain types of monster.

Methods that can be used on all engulfing monsters:
* Kill or destroy the engulfing monster. This is the best way to be rid of an engulfing monster, but it may not be an option if your player is near death and cannot survive a few more turns inside the monster.
* Use "opening" magic (a [[wand of opening]], the [[spellbook of knock|spell of knock]], the [[Bell of Opening]]).
* [[Scare]] the engulfing monster using a [[tooled horn]], a [[drum]], or [[Magicbane]].
* [[Polymorph]] yourself into a monster that is too big to be engulfed ([[Physical size|size]] [[Monsters (by size)|Huge or larger]]).
* Polymorph the engulfing monster. A monster with an engulfing attack that is polymorphed into one without an engulfing attack will release its prey immediately (and have its health reduced to one point by the physical trauma). However, if by chance the new form is ''also'' an engulfing monster, you will [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20081020 remain engulfed].
* [[Teleport]] yourself out (this will not work on [[non-teleport level]]s).
* [[Teleport]] the engulfing monster, if you are on a non-teleport level. The monster will disappear and you will be left behind. If this is used on a level where teleportation is allowed, you will be teleported with the monster.

Methods that are applicable only to certain monsters:
* Whirlies and blobs will eventually release you, giving you a chance to escape, if you wait. If you wait inside a digester, however, it will digest you completely.
* Whirlies will release you if you zap them with a [[wand of slow monster]] or the {{spell of|slow monster}} spell.
* Non-whirlies can be ruptured if you zap a [[wand of digging]] or the {{spell of|dig}} spell at them. The trauma sets their health to one point.
* Live engulfing monsters such as digesters can be killed quickly with a [[wand of death]] or [[finger of death]]. This will not work on vortices, which are [[nonliving]].
* Digesters will immediately spit you out if you put on a [[ring of slow digestion]].
* Most engulfing monsters can be pacified or tamed using the {{spell of|charm monster}} spell or a [[scroll of taming]].
* Non-acidic engulfing monsters can be [[Stoning|petrified]] with a wielded [[footrice]] corpse.  You will escape by "jumping through an opening" in the resulting [[statue]]. This will not work on [[ochre jellies]] or on [[Juiblex]], both of which inherently resist petrification because of their [[acid]]ity.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Juiblex now only loses half of his HP when hit with digging magic from inside.}}

When you are expelled from an engulfing monster, you are subject to any [[trap]]s on the square you are released to. If the engulfing monster has moved you, this may trigger traps that you have not discovered yet. A flying engulfer may also drop you over water or lava.

==Strategy==
Because melee attacks will always hit when engulfed, this can be useful for practicing melee weapon skills at low levels. Low-level engulfers such as [[fog cloud]]s and [[dust vortex|dust vortices]] are preferred for this.

Wearing a [[ring of slow digestion]] prevents [[Digestion|digesting]] attacks. Instead of being swallowed, "You get regurgitated! Obviously the <monster> doesn't like your taste." and you are expelled.

The time you will be engulfed is shortened by high monster level, and lengthened by good (low) AC. This means digesters will fully digest you faster if they are high level or you are poorly armored. The effect is perhaps unintuitive for other engulfers, however. The minimum number of (the engulfer's) turns you will be engulfed is 2 (including the one on which you are swallowed), which means at normal speed you are guaranteed at least one to attempt to escape a digester.

==Variants==
[[SLASH'EM]] adds new monsters with engulfing attacks: [[yellow jelly]], [[orange jelly]], [[rancid jelly]], and ([[giant shoggoth|giant]]) [[shoggoth]].

In [[GruntHack]], [[Dragon (GruntHack)|adult dragons]] have digestion attacks.

==NetHack: The game, the legend...==

===Q: What is NetHack?===

"[[NetHack]] is a single player dungeon exploration game that runs on a wide variety of computer systems, with a variety of graphical and text interfaces all using the same game engine. Unlike many other [[Dungeons_%26_Dragons|Dungeons & Dragons]]<nowiki>-inspired</nowiki> games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering the detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight — in fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die quickly. Each game presents a different landscape — the random number generator provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of the dungeon and its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of a number of characters: you can pick your race, your role, and your gender." <nowiki>[</nowiki>From: [http://www.nethack.org/ http://www.nethack.org/.<nowiki>]</nowiki>]

"On the screen is kept a map of where you have been and what you have seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more of the level, it appears on the screen in front of you.  When NetHack's
ancestor [[Rogue_(game)|Rogue]] first appeared, its screen orientation was almost unique among computer fantasy games. Since then, screen orientation has become the norm rather than the exception; NetHack continues this fine tradition. Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen." <nowiki>[</nowiki>From the [[Guidebook|NetHack Guidebook]].<nowiki>]</nowiki>

===Q: That sounds pretty good, where can I get it? How much does it cost?===

NetHack is free software. That's right, FREE. Not shareware. Available to you at the price of $0, under a license that permits you to freely modify and distribute it. (Note, however, that NetHack is NOT in the public domain; see the file <nowiki>'</nowiki>license' or <nowiki>'</nowiki>license.txt<nowiki>'</nowiki> that comes with NetHack for details.)

[http://www.nethack.org/ <http://www.nethack.org/>] always has the latest version available (currently 3.6.0).

===Q: What computer is it playable on?===

There are official binary releases for Amiga, Atari, [[Linux]], Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, and 32-bit [[Microsoft_Windows|Windows]] systems. The source code (written in [[ANSI_C|C]]) is available as well, which should [[Compiling|compile]] and run on just about every system imaginable (or at least every system that can run a C compiler). There are limitations, however; for example, no-one has yet succeeded in overcoming the difficulty of porting NetHack to the Palm, though other PDA implementations have been managed.

===Q: I installed and ran NetHack, now what do all these symbols and stuff mean?===

Consult the file "Guidebook.txt" (or something similar) that came with NetHack. It's the NetHack Guidebook, and should be able to answer any questions you have about the game display or controls. If you didn't get a copy of Guidebook.txt (or other documentation), download one from [http://www.nethack.org/common/info.html#Docs <http://www.nethack.org/common/info.html#Docs>.] You can also gain information about symbols onscreen using the {{kbd|/}} or {{kbd|;}} commands.

===Q: All these letters and things confuse me! Is there a version of NetHack with graphics instead?===

Depending on the system you are playing it on, yes. There are graphical (or "[[Tileset|tiled]]") versions of NetHack that use graphics in place of the [[American_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange|ASCII]] characters. Consult the readme file specific to your system for details. If there's no mention of a tiled version, your system probably does not support tiles.

There are also several "unofficial" versions of NetHack (meaning only that they were not released by the [[DevTeam]]) that use enhanced graphical interfaces, among which the more popular are:

* Vulture (development of Jaakko Peltonen's "Falcon's Eye"): [http://www.darkarts.co.za/vulture/ <http://www.darkarts.co.za/vulture/>]
* noeGNUd (supports a wide range of 2D and 3D character — and tile-based views and game playback): [http://www.darkarts.co.za/noegnud <http://www.darkarts.co.za/noegnud>]

===Q: Is there a multiplayer version of NetHack?===

No. Nor is there likely to be, according to the DevTeam. "We think you can't do that playably without compromising the basic idea of being able to think as long as you want about what you're doing." <nowiki>[</nowiki>From [http://www.nethack.org/ <http://www.nethack.org/>.<nowiki>]</nowiki>] The only player interaction in NetHack is that of [[Bones|bones files]] and the score list on a multiplayer system.  However, the variant [[AceHack]] had a multiplayer patch made to it that is likely to be ported to [[NetHack4]] at some point in the distant future.

===Q: Why is it called "Net"Hack if you can't play it online against other people?===

"The <nowiki>'</nowiki>Net<nowiki>'</nowiki> in NetHack refers to the way the developers, many of whom have never met in person, organize the work on the program." <nowiki>[</nowiki>From [http://www.nethack.org/ <http://www.nethack.org/>.<nowiki>]</nowiki>]

You can play NetHack online, just not directly against other people. [http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/index.php?scat=04servers <http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/index.php?scat=04servers>] lists several public servers you could try. Try doing a search for "[[Public_server|NetHack Servers]]" in your favorite search engine, and connect to one of the many available.

There are also ways to add the "bones files" of other adventures to your local copy of NetHack, such as with the "Hearse" program [http://hearse.krollmark.com/ <http://hearse.krollmark.com/>.] [[Hearse]] currently supports the official DOS and Windows binary versions, the official Linux non-Qt binary version and compatibly-compiled [[Unix]] installations, as well as the unofficial Psion port, the latest [[SLASH'EM]] stable and (currently) development versions, and Philipp Lucas' distribution of PatchHack 5.0 (with and without the Hell Patch enabled). Support for other versions may be added if sufficient demand exists.

===Q: When will the next version be released?===

According to the DevTeam, "when it's ready". Details of core NetHack development have always been closely held, and though minor aspects have been leaked (see [[Next version]] for a collation), the only real visible signs of progress are occasional updates to the public buglist. In the meantime, several NetHack [[variant]]s are in active development, and many third-party patches are available: see [[#Q:_What_is_SLASH.27EM.3F|1.4.10]] through [[#Q:_What_are_patches.2C_and_how_do_I_apply_them.3F|1.4.13]] for details.

==rec.games.roguelike.nethack==

===Q: What is rec.games.roguelike.nethack?===

rec.games.roguelike.nethack, often abbreviated to "[[rgrn]]", is a [[Category:Usenet|Usenet]] newsgroup "concerned with NetHack and related games" (from the group charter). It's the successor to the groups net.games.hack and rec.games.hack, and lives in the rec.games.roguelike.* hierarchy, where roguelike games other than NetHack and its variants either have their own groups or fall by default into rec.games.roguelike.misc. Readers of rgrn may also want to read rec.games.roguelike.announce, a moderated group where postings of significant general interest for
roguelike players are made.

===Q: What's with the posts labeled "YAAP" or "YASD"?===

rgrn uses some terminology that can be confusing to the uninitiated. For a fairly complete list, please see [http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/abbr-343.txt <http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/abbr-343.txt>,] but here is a list of the more common abbreviations:

* '''YAAP: Yet Another Ascension Post'''
* '''YAFAP: Yet Another First Ascension Post.''' Someone has completed a game of NetHack (possibly for the first time) and wants to brag/show off. Finishing NetHack is not a trivial accomplishment, so some bragging is probably called for (see [[#Q:_I.27ve_won.21_I.27ve_won.21|1.2.9]]).
* '''[[YASD]]: Yet Another Stupid Death.'''
* '''[[YAAD]]: Yet Another Annoying Death.''' Get used to this phenomenon if you're going to play NetHack. Someone has died in a particularly amusing or annoying way, and wants pity for his or her stupidity or a shoulder to cry on.
* '''[[YAFM]]: Yet Another Funny Message.'''
* '''YAFMC: Yet Another Funny Message Combination'''
* '''YAFP: Yet Another Funny Prompt''' Sometimes, the messages NetHack gives you are amusing, or have a strange juxtaposition of several messages or an odd mix of inventory letters. Someone has found a message or combination that they liked.
* '''YANI: Yet Another New (Nifty) Idea (Item).''' Someone has an idea for an improvement or addition to the game.
* '''[[DYWYPI]]?: Do You Want Your Possessions Identified?''' The first question NetHack asks you if you are killed. Many posters use it as shorthand for "And then the <monster/trap/stupid move/typo> killed me."
* '''The DevTeam:''' The DevTeam is the group of programmers responsible for the maintenance and development of NetHack. Remember: The DevTeam Think of Everything! ([[TDTTOE]]!)
* '''The [[RNG]]: Random Number Generator -or- Random NetHack God.''' Every game of NetHack is different, thanks to the effects of the random numbers used in the creation of the dungeon. Sometimes it seems like the random numbers have a malicious will of their own and are therefore personified, as in "The RNG was especially cruel to me today."

As well as abbreviations, rgrn (like any community) has developed its own jargon for frequently-discussed concepts and strategies, for example "pudding farming" and the "protection racket"; Eva Myers has a discussion of these at [http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/rgrnterms.html <http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/rgrnterms.html>.]

===Q: What's a "spoiler"?===

A "[[spoiler]]" is an explanation of something in the game. That explanation may spoil the fun of discovering that something for yourself. Since some people would rather figure things out for
themselves, they don't want the answer blurted out. For this reason, if you do post a spoiler, you may wish to buffer it with some blank space (20 lines or so, or a formfeed character) so no one reads it accidentally. Alternatively, and (given the wide variety of newsreader displays) preferably, you can ROT13 encipher the spoiler (a simple cipher where a->n, b->o, ... z->m; see [http://www.rot13.com/ <http://www.rot13.com/>] if your newsreader doesn't support it natively). If you're starting a spoilersome thread, consider putting "(spoilers)" in the Subject header.

However, if you read this newsgroup you should accept that you're probably going to come across spoilers whether you want to or not.

===Q: What's a "source diver"?===

The computer code for NetHack is publicly available, unlike that for most games. Someone with programming skill can look through the code (or "source") to get the answers to questions about how the game works. This is called "[[source diving]]". For the curious, NetHack is written in [[ANSI_C|C]].

===Q: I'm having trouble with my game, can I post my saved game file so someone can help me out?===

No. The posting of binaries (this includes screenshots) to non-binary newsgroups such as rgrn is frowned upon. If you feel you need a map to explain your problem, use an ASCII "screenshot" instead.  Besides, saved games won't work across platforms, and depending on the variables set when the game was compiled, may not even work if they are from the same platform. Describe your situation/problem as best you can, and we'll help you out as best we can.

===Q: What's this "netiquette" that other posters keep mentioning?===

"Netiquette" refers to InterNET etIQUETTE, or the polite way of doing things online.  Following these conventions is not only polite, but will make your articles much easier to read, and therefore more people are likely to read them. With specific regard to the newsgroup rgrn, there are a few things you should keep in mind when posting:

====Top posting====

"Top posting" refers to putting your response before the quoted material you are responding to. When you respond to an article, put your response below the text you quote. (If you're responding to several separate points in the same article, put your response below each individually.) This ensures that the later responses stay in proper chronological order, making reading both easier and more logical. Unfortunately, top posting is the default for some newsreaders (notably Microsoft Outlook Express). This doesn't make it correct. (A longer article on good Usenet quoting style can be found at [http://www.anta.net/misc/nnq/nquote.shtml <http://www.anta.net/misc/nnq/nquote.shtml>.)]

====Quoting====

Quote appropriate context. Usenet is an asynchronous medium, and you can't be sure that everyone's received, read, or remembered the article you're responding to, so your message should make sense in isolation. Only quote the relevant parts of the article, and cut the rest (including signatures). This keeps articles relatively short, and easy to read. In the same vein, don't cut so much that it's hard to determine who or what you are responding to. Pay particular attention to the attributions, which indicate who said what; if you quote someone's text, attribute it, otherwise remove their attribution. (Again, see the article referred to in the previous paragraph.)

====Line lengths====

Set your newsreader for line lengths around 70 characters to avoid other newsreaders mangling your post when displayed or quoted.

====Signatures====

Signatures should only be a few lines long; the "standard" maximum is 4 lines of 80 characters. Make sure that your signature, if you have one, is preceded by a proper sig separator: i.e.  "--", two hyphens and a space, with nothing else on the line.

====Subject headers====

Make your subject specific ("Are [[kobold]]s poisonous?" is much better than "Question" or "Help") without trying to stuff your entire article into it. Even if the question you're asking or point you're making is in your subject header, repeat it in the body of the message; and ensure that the article is comprehensible without depending on the subject for crucial context. Many newsreaders' displays make reading subject headers in direct conjunction with article text awkward, and having all the relevant content in the body will make quoting for response easier.

====HTML====

Usenet is a text medium, and as such many newsreaders render HTML messages as practically unreadable gibberish. Plain text only, please.

====Binaries====

rgrn is a non-binary newsgroup. If you have a binary file that you feel the group would like access to, upload it somewhere and provide a URL.

====Personal attacks and flames====

Personal attacks have no place in a public forum; if you feel you must flame someone, take it to email.

Your best bet, as with most newsgroups, is to read the newsgroup for a while and get a feeling for the place before you post.

===Q: What topics should I be careful about discussing?===

Apart from obviously "controversial" things which wouldn't generally be on-topic for rgrn anyway, there are several subjects which you should be cautious about raising. These fall into three main categories:

====Holy wars====

People are unlikely to change their minds on these; argument just tends to lead to bickering and flaming. A by no means comprehensive list:        

* vi-keys ({{kbd|h}}{{kbd|j}}{{kbd|k}}{{kbd|l}}) versus [[Options#number_pad|number_pad]].
* ASCII versus tiles.
* Arguments from realism versus "NetHack Is Not Real Life".
* The morality of savescumming (see [[#Q:_Did_you_guys_know_you_can_copy_your_save_games_and_restore_them_after_you_die.3F_This_makes_the_game_a_LOT_easier.21|1.4.1]]) and rerolling starting characters.
* Whether NetHack's license is more or less "free" than some other program's license.

====Hardy perennials====

Fine in themselves, these subjects come up often enough that there's little new to say about them. Some examples:

* What background music to play NetHack to.
* What letters to assign inventory to.
* Age/location surveys.
* The [[Foocubus|succubi]]/chains/bullwhips/BDSM jokes.

====Cans of worms====

Some suggestions for new features or changes to gameplay are recurrently made, but open up large-scale problems of implementation feasibility or game balance; as a result, they're more or less at the status "show us a working patch that doesn't break the game, then we'll talk". A few examples:

* [[Potion]]s leaving empty bottles when {{kbd|q}}uaffed.
* [[Ettin]]s wearing two helmets/amulets, mariliths six rings, etc.
* Facing.
* Arbitrary rather than straight-line targetting.
* Platform- or version-independent savefiles and bonesfiles.
       
Please research the archives (Google Groups should be handy here) beforehand and only post on these subjects if you think you have something particularly new to say; and try not to make it inflammatory.

===Q: Anything else I shouldn't post?===

While in general people will be happy to answer genuine queries, it's a good idea to do at least some basic reading before asking them, checking they're not covered in the Guidebook (see [[#Q:_I_installed_and_ran_NetHack.2C_now_what_do_all_these_symbols_and_stuff_mean.3F|1.1.4]]) or this FAQ first. Repeatedly asking questions that are easily answerable on your own falls into the "somewhat annoying" category.

Posting misinformation is also generally considered a bad idea; while it's not required that you have an in-depth knowledge of the game to be able to post here, if you're answering questions or asserting facts it's better to do so based on what you know or can test rather than half-remembered hearsay. In particular, there are a number of [[Player's misconceptions|common misconceptions]] that you should be aware of and not perpetuate: Eva Myers documents many of these at her "Myths and Facts about NetHack" page, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190712122721/https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/ <http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/>.]

===Q: I've won! I've won!===

Congratulations! Feel free to tell us all about how it went; post a YAAP or YAFAP (see [[#Q:_What.27s_with_the_posts_labeled_.22YAAP.22_or_.22YASD.22.3F|1.2.2]]) with a description of the game. (If you're playing a modified version of the game, it's a good idea to make it clear what modifications have been applied.)

It's conventional for these posts to include some of the information from the endgame disclosure screens (though you'll want to be selective about this: how many monsters you killed in total is
interesting, exactly how many giant beetles you killed usually isn't). If you're playing with a text-based interface, you can copy and paste the details from the terminal (under the Win32 tty interface, Edit|Mark from the console's system menu); be careful to only use straight ASCII for "screenshots", not [[IBMgraphics]] or [[Options#DECgraphics|DECgraphics]]. Alternatively, there is a "dump" patch available (see [[#Q:_What_are_patches.2C_and_how_do_I_apply_them.3F|1.4.13]] for how to apply it, or for details on PatchHack which includes it), allowing you to automatically write out the endgame information to a file, available from Jukka Lahtinen's site:
[http://www.netsonic.fi/~walker/nethack.html#dump <http://www.netsonic.fi/~walker/nethack.html#dump>]

==Gameplay and Spoilers==

===Q: This game is really hard! Does anyone win? How?===

Believe it or not, people can and do "win" NetHack! The main key to winning and not dying is patience. Nothing happens in the game if you don't hit a key; this lets you think each of your moves out carefully. Each time your character meets a grisly or stupid demise, use it as a learning experience, and try not to repeat your mistake the next time you play.

"The Complete Beginner's Guide to NetHack" contains a great deal of advice on playing NetHack. It's posted to the group frequently, or find it online at [http://www.melankolia.net/nethack/nethack.guide.html <http://www.melankolia.net/nethack/nethack.guide.html>.] It does a good job of balancing advice against spoilers.

===Q: How much damage does <weapon> do? What good is an <item>? How can I fix my armor when it gets [[Erosion|rusty]]?===

These questions (and many others like them) all fall under the heading of spoilers, and as such are outside the bounds of this FAQ list. There are numerous websites that will give you all the
information you could want about the details of NetHack. Some of the recommended ones include:

*Yet Another NetHack Site (by Kate Nepveu): [http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/ <http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/>]
* Dylan O'Donnell's spoiler page: [http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/ <http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/>]
* NethackWiki, a publicly-editable wiki: [[Main Page|<https://nethackwiki.com/>]]

Eva Myers has a useful overview index of available spoilers at: [http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/spoilerlist.html <http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/spoilerlist.html>]
        
Of course, if you don't (or can't) find the answer you seek, post your question and we'll do our best to answer it. (If your answer could be considered a "spoiler", see question [[#Q:_What.27s_a_.22spoiler.22.3F|1.2.3]]).

===Q: Why are there TWO stairs leading down (or up)?===

You've discovered a "[[branch]]" off the main dungeon. There are several side trips you can make on your way to the bottom of the [[Dungeons of Doom]]. Some of them aren't needed to finish the game, but can garner you useful items and experience.

===Q: I'm stuck! There doesn't seem to be any way down/up from the level I'm on!===

There's always a way onwards. If you're in the main Dungeon, there will be a way down, and a way to reach it; search every wall for secret doors (especially where the walls are near blank areas
of the map). Check to make sure the stairs aren't hidden under an item.  Move or smash any [[boulder]]s or [[statue]]s. If you're still stuck, find (or [[Digging|dig]]) a hole or trap door and drop down to the next level.

If you're not in the main dungeon, you may have reached the end of the current branch; time to retrace your steps and carry on by the other route.

===Q: Why can't I successfully cast any spells? Why are all my failure rates 100%?===

"[[Spellcasting|Casting]] a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing various types of armor may interfere with that." [From The NetHack Guidebook.]
Metal items in particular are very inflexible.

===Q: Someone just told me to retrieve an [[artifact]]; where do I go now?===

Downstairs from where you are. If you can't find the staircase, it's probably behind a secret door. It's no use going back through the magic portal to look for it, because that's not where it is.

===Q: I'm on a [[Maze|maze level]] with a sealed-off area in the middle. I've searched and searched, but can't find a secret door. I can't dig or teleport through the walls, how do I get in there?===

There is a way in, just not from the level you are on. Keep exploring, and on some lower level you'll find a portal that will take you where you want to go.

===Q: I'm trying to fight a monster that keeps teleporting away. How do I get it to stop doing that so I can kill it?===

Two types of monsters do this; lowish-level ones that teleport randomly every so often (and it's just a case of trying to get the kill in while they're in one spot for long enough) or after performing their attack on you (try not to let them), and higher-level boss monsters that teleport away to heal up. In the latter case, find out where the monster goes (it's always the same spot), and get there first. You may need to use teleport yourself to get ahead of it.

===Q:   I blocked up the trapdoors in this back corridor, and now I can't get down!===

Those trapdoors were the only way down from that particular special level, and once filled you can't dig through them again. However, you can use level teleport to get to the level immediately beneath; teleport control would be useful here.
 
===Q: There's a monster stuck behind a boulder I particularly want to push somewhere. How do I get rid of it?===

You can try to kill the monster: thrown or fired weapons will go past the boulder, as will zapped wands or spells (though striking or force bolt will break the boulder, which may not be what you want). Dropping all (or nearly all) your inventory will allow you to squeeze into the same space as the boulder and attack the monster directly; but this leaves you mostly defenceless, probably bare-handed, and can have other undesirable side-effects. Or you can teleport both away in one zap, though you won't be able to control where they end up.

==Miscellaneous==

===Q: Did you guys know you can copy your save games and restore them after you die? This makes the game a LOT easier!===

Yes, it does make it easier, but that's not the point. The game is SUPPOSED to be hard. Diabolically hard, as a matter of fact. This tactic is known as "savescumming" around these parts, and will garner you no respect; indeed, the best you can hope for is polite scorn.

The DevTeam has added a mode to allow you to play without dying, "[[explore mode]]" (see question [[#Q:_How_do_I_get_into_explore_or_wizard_mode.3F|1.4.2]]), but the downside is that your score won't be recorded. How you play is your decision, just don't come here posting YAAP if you did it by savescumming. You should be aware, however, that there is a general consensus that savescumming is actually detrimental to the development of proper playing skills; being able to circumvent the required caution and tough strategic decisions of NetHack may mean never learning to handle them well.

===Q: How do I get into explore or wizard mode?===

To enter [[explore mode]] use the "-X" switch on the command line (ie, type "nethack -X" on the command line) or use the "X" command in the game. Be warned that once you switch to Explore mode, there is no returning to a regular game. Starting explore mode from the command line will also grant you a wand of wishing. If you die in explore mode, you can easily revive and try again, but as noted above, your score will not be recorded.

To enter [[Wizard mode|wizard]] (or debug; no relation to the [[Wizard]] role) mode type "nethack -uwizard -D" on the command line. If this doesn't work, then you might have to enter a different name, be logged in as a different user, or in your copy of the game wizard mode may be disabled. Ask the person who compiled or installed the game about this.

===Q: What can I do in wizard mode that I can't do in a normal game?===

In addition to the ability to continue after death as in explore mode, the following is a list of wizard mode-specific commands:

* {{kbd|ctrl|E}}: Detect secret doors and traps
* {{kbd|ctrl|F}}: Do magic mapping
* {{kbd|ctrl|G}}: Create monster
* {{kbd|ctrl|I}}: Identify items in pack
* {{kbd|ctrl|O}}: Tell locations of special levels
* {{kbd|ctrl|T}}: Do intra-level teleport
* {{kbd|ctrl|V}}: Do trans-level teleport
* {{kbd|ctrl|W}}: Make a wish
* {{kbd|ctrl|X}}: Show attributes including intrinsic abilities

There are also a number of additional extended (#) commands, most producing highly technical state information only useful for debugging purposes.

===Q:   My game crashed and I lost my character! Is there anything I can do?===

Maybe. There is a program that comes with NetHack called "recover" that may be able to restore a crashed game, depending on how NetHack was compiled. Check for a file called "recover.txt" for an explanation. On some platforms, "recover" may have been incorporated into the game itself, and restarting the game using the same character name will work (if the crash was recoverable from to start with).

===Q: I found a YAFMC! I found a bell on top of a grave and the headstone said "Saved by the bell." Quite a coincidence, huh?===

No, it's not. If the headstone generated for a grave reads "Saved by the bell," then a bell is generated for the grave as well.

===Q: Who's Schroedinger, and why did this quantum mechanic have [[Schroedinger's_Cat|his cat]] in a box?===

Erwin Schroedinger (1887-1961) was a physicist who devised a famous thought experiment to translate quantum superposition into the macroscopic classical-mechanical world. It involved an impenetrable box (and, in NetHack, the box shows as empty until it's opened) containing a cat that would be killed by a 50/50 radioactive-decay trigger; the resulting state of the cat, and how it is resolved when the box is opened, depends on the particular school of quantum theory you subscribe to, but one interpretation is that it is both alive and dead until observed.
       
===Q: Why are elves [[Alignment|chaotic]]? The elves in "[[The Lord of the Rings]]" seem to be lawful.===

NetHack draws on more than one source, and there are more elves than Tolkien's (who weren't always as lawful as all that themselves, if you read the "Silmarillion"). Consider, by way of example, Michael Moorcock's Melniboneans (and remember that Stormbringer is also in the game), and Steven Brust's Dragaerans. In addition to these, there's hundreds of years of tradition of the land of Faerie being one where human concepts of law simply do not apply (though it's sometimes divided explicitly into a Seelie and Unseelie Court). For a modern treatment of this concept, read Poul Anderson's "Three Hearts and Three Lions"; or [[Terry Pratchett]]'s "Lords and Ladies", for that matter.

===Q: I think I found a bug in the game! What should I do?===

Quite possibly you have. If you're playing the latest version (3.4.3) you may want to check the DevTeam's list of known bugs (available at [http://www.nethack.org/v343/bugs.html <http://www.nethack.org/v343/bugs.html>)] to make sure it's a new one. If it's not a new one, the DevTeam may suggest a workaround. If it is a bug that hasn't been caught yet, please contact the DevTeam
about it at [http://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html <http://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html>,] or directly by e-mail at <nethack-bugs@nethack.org>. They appreciate knowing about bugs so they can fix them in the next release.

As well, please do post about it! Chances are, someone will put together a patch pretty quickly if it's really serious. To help work out where exactly the bug might lie, please give all the information you can, including the exact text of any error messages the game produced.

===Q: Has anyone ever written a program to play NetHack automatically (a NetHack "bot")?===

Not successfully.  People have written "bots", or programs that will play the game by themselves, for some other roguelikes. These bots usually play pretty successfully.

However, no one has yet written a well-functioning one for NetHack, and the commonly held opinion is that NetHack is too complex for a "bot" that functions well to be currently practicable. If you're not dissuaded by this, you might want to address your efforts to NetHack's predecessor Hack first, as a rather simpler stepping-stone.

===Q: What is SLASH'EM?===

[[SLASH'EM]] (Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack — Extended Magic) is a variant of NetHack with more races, classes and generally just more stuff. Learn more about it at [http://www.slashem.org/<http://www.slashem.org/>.] Please mark questions about SLASH'EM in rgrn with an "[S]" or "[SLASH'EM]" in the subject line (at the end is best, as some newsreaders strip initial square brackets), so people who only play regular ("vanilla") NetHack can more easily recognize or filter your article.

===Q: What is SporkHack?===

[[SporkHack]] is a variant of NetHack with a number of significant gameplay changes. Unlike SLASH'EM, its focus is less on adding new stuff, and more on improving balance and providing challenge and variety for experienced players. Learn more about it, and play online, at [http://sporkhack.nineball.org/ <http://sporkhack.nineball.org/>.] Please mark questions about SporkHack in rgrn with a "[Spork] or "[SPORK]" in the subject line (at the end is best, as some newsreaders strip initial square brackets), so people who only play regular ("vanilla") NetHack can more easily recognize or filter your article.

===Q: What is UnNetHack?===

[[UnNetHack]] is a variant of NetHack, aimed at reducing predictability and increasing player challenge, along with adding more stuff. Its homepage is at [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unnethack/ <http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unnethack/>.] Please mark questions about UnNetHack in rgrn with a "[U] or "[UnNetHack]" in the subject line (at the end is best, as some newsreaders strip initial square brackets), so people who only play regular ("vanilla") NetHack can more easily recognize or filter your article.

===Q: What are patches, and how do I apply them?===

There are many "[[patch]]es" or code changes that people have written to alter or fix something about how NetHack works. These aren't "official" changes to the game, but may include such things as new magic items or different levels for the "Hell" area of NH. Pasi Kallinen maintains a database of published patches at [http://bilious.alt.org/ <http://bilious.alt.org/>;] there is also [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/patches.html <http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/patches.html>,] maintained
by Ali Harlow, which is no longer updated but contains some patches Pasi's doesn't.

To use these patches, you need to be able to compile them into your NetHack executable using a C compiler. First, you need to be able to compile the basic game itself: download the source (see [[#Q:_What_computer_is_it_playable_on.3F|1.1.3]]), read the installation instructions for your platform in the appropriate sys/ subdirectory, acquire one of the C compilers those recommend if necessary, and follow the steps for compilation and installation.

Once this is working, you need a patch utility to apply the patch to the source. For DOS or Windows, you can use the patch program from the djgpp distribution available at [http://www.delorie.com/ <http://www.delorie.com/>.] Use this utility to patch the base code and recompile the game.

===Q: I killed a shopkeeper named Izchak, why is everyone so mad at me?===

[[Izchak Miller]], one of the founding members of the DevTeam, passed away on April 1, 1994 from complications due to cancer. As he was responsible for, among other things, much of the shopkeeper logic, the owner of the lighting shop was named for him as a tribute. The DevTeam dedicated version 3.2 of NetHack to the memory of Izchak Miller. Many players who will happily slay everything else that moves will spare Izchak's life as a sign of respect.

For a little more info, including a post from Izchak's daughter, check out the following thread from 1996 in rgrn: [http://tinyurl.com/r7l23 <http://tinyurl.com/r7l23>]

===Q:What websites have general information about NetHack?===

In addition to the sites mentioned in section [[t#Q:_How_much_damage_does_.3Cweapon.3E_do.3F_What_good_is_an_.3Citem.3E.3F_How_can_I_fix_my_armor_when_it_gets_rusty.3F|1.3.2]] above, there are several excellent starting places for looking for NetHack web resources.

* The DevTeam's links page: [http://www.nethack.org/common/links.html <http://www.nethack.org/common/links.html>]
* Dion Nicolaas' NetHack Index: [http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/ <http://www.nicolaas.net/erebus/>]
* Ali Harlow's NetHack Page (particularly good for SLASH'EM): [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack.html <http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack.html>]

Almost any NetHack webpage of value will be linked to by at least one of these sites.

The '''hobgoblin''', {{monsym|hobgoblin}}, is a [[monster]] in [[NetHack]].

==Generation==
Hobgoblins are frequently found in [[throne]] rooms. They will [[Monster starting inventory|be generated with]] an orcish helm 50% of the time, and they also have a 50% chance of receiving a weapon (either an [[scimitar]] or an [[orcish dagger]] with equal chance). {{refsrc|makemon.c|329}}

==Strategy==
Hobgoblins are relatively weak and slow, and thus usually not a significant threat. As orcish monsters, they are especially useful as [[sacrifice]] fodder for orc characters to convert [[altar]]s with, especially if a throne room occurs on the same floor.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Hobgoblin}}

The hobgoblin was originally a helpful spirit of the hearth in folklore once considered helpful, but the spread of Christianity gave it a reputation as a mischievous prankster.

''NetHack'' hobgoblins are borrowed from the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], where the name is used to describe a larger kind of orc. In the preface of ''The Hobbit'', he states that "''Orc'' is not an English word. It occurs in one or two places but is usually translated goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds)".

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for
wicked goblin spirits, as in Bunyan's "Hobgoblin nor foul
friend", but its more correct use is for the friendly spirits
of the brownie type.  In "A midsummer night's dream" a
fairy says to Shakespeare's Puck:
        Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
        You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
        Are you not he?
and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
if that was an ill-omened word.
Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.
One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted
the road between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross
the little river Kent, which flowed into the Tess.  He was
exorcised and laid under a large stone by the roadside for
ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to
sit on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever.
The ninety-nine years is nearly up, so trouble may soon be
heard of on the road between Hurworth and Neasham.

The '''goblin''', {{monsym|goblin}}, is a common monster that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is likely to be among the very first [[orcish]] [[monster]]s you meet, if not one of the first monsters overall.

Goblins are the only orcish monster not marked as [[strong]].

==Generation==
Goblins will be generated from practically the start of the game, and often generate peaceful towards chaotic player characters, particularly [[Orc (starting race)|orcs]]. They have a 50% chance to [[Monster starting inventory|be generated with]] an [[orcish helm]] like other orcish monsters{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|399|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} - however, the only other orcish item they can generate with is an [[orcish dagger]], which they have a separate 50% chance to receive.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|429|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Various named goblins may appear in [[Minetown]] and other branches of the dungeon in a game where [[Orcish Town]] is generated.

==Strategy==
Goblins are generally insignificant to all but the weakest characters, unless their randomly generated helm and/or dagger turn out to be decently enchanted, or else they come across an attack [[wand]]. They are usually worth killing or siccing [[pet]]s on for orcish players if there are [[altar]]s nearby, since their corpses can be sacrificed to convert non-chaotic altars or summon peaceful [[demon princes]] and other major demons from chaotic ones. Their orcish daggers can be used as early weapons to train in [[dagger]], or serve as a way to force open locked [[container]]s.

Neutral players should make sure to kill goblins themselves - as a early chaotic spawn, the [[alignment record]] gain ensures that successful [[prayer]] is possible after turn 300. This is essential for strategies like the [[protection racket]] (which relies on gaining alignment while avoiding killing coaligned monsters and keeping experience low) and conducts that require frequent prayer (like [[foodless]]).

The Orctown altar in particular is a good candidate for player orcs to sacrifice goblins on, especially those seeking to maximize Luck and/or generate [[foocubi]] - be sure to convert it with a non-orcish corpse first, as same-race sacrifice does not convert an unaligned altar, and you will take a -2 Luck penalty.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Goblin}}
The goblin has its origins in the folklore of multiple European cultures, first appearing in Middle Ages-era stories. Their abilities, temperaments and appearances depend entirely on the story and country of origin. They are almost always small and grotesque, vary from mischievous to outright malicious, and are usually [[gold lover|greedy]] (especially for [[gold]] and jewelry). Many folkloric goblins have magical abilities similar to a fairy or demon.

In ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and other modern fantasy fiction, "goblinoids" refer to goblins and related creatures such as [[bugbear]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s, the latter of which are also orcish monsters in ''NetHack''; their goblins are also derived from the orcs of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who in his Middle-earth works used "orc" and "goblin" for the same race of creatures. Most fantasy-based role-playing games also employ goblins as standard beginner-level enemies for the player.

==History==
The goblin was first introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]]; however, long before that it was included in the bestiary for hack121, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]]. The [[hobgoblin]] generally occupied the niche of the "weaker orc" in versions prior to 3.0.0.

From versions [[3.1.0]] to [[3.2.3]], several goblins could be encountered in the [[Elf quest]] branch, including the [[Elf (role)|Elf's]] [[quest nemesis]], the [[Goblin King]]. Many goblins also appear in the [[Hobbit quest]] as well.

==Variants==
===EvilHack===
[[EvilHack]] adds three stronger types of goblin: the [[goblin shaman]], the [[goblin outrider]], and the [[goblin-captain]].

===dNetHack===
[[dNetHack]] revives the elf quest as the [[Elvish Racial Quest]] - the quest nemesis is now the [[Necromancer (Quest Nemesis)|Necromancer]], but goblins are still a significant presence on the home, locate and lower filler levels.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted.  They make
no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones.  They
can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled
dwarves, when they take the trouble, though they are usually
untidy and dirty.  Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes,
tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well,
or get other people to make to their design, prisoners and
slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and
light.

The '''hill orc''', {{monsym|hill orc}}, is the weakest form of [[orcish]] [[monster]] normally found in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
Hill orcs almost always appear in large [[group]]s, which can contain anywhere between 2 and 11 members - the group will be smaller if some of them are generated peaceful. They [[Monster starting inventory|frequently carry]] [[scimitar]]s or [[orcish dagger]]s, and wear [[orcish helm]]s.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|397|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Some hill orcs may generate as peaceful towards [[Orc (starting race)|orcish]] players.

In a game that has [[Orcish Town]], large numbers of named hill orcs may appear around and within the town walls - other hill orcs can appear elsewhere in the [[Gnomish Mines]] and the main branch, carrying various looted items with them.{{refsrc|src/mkmaze.c|740|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mkmaze.c|797|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Hill orc numbers may be formidable and pose a problem for unprepared characters, but they are easy to defeat individually. Hill orcs usually mark one of the first instances where you will have to use crowd control strategies, such as drawing them into a corridor so that only one of them can attack you at a time. Be wary if any of them have [[scrolls]] or [[wands]] on hand.

Hill orcs make a decent source of food for a starting character, providing 200 nutrition; their corpses also make decent fodder for [[sacrifice]] if you can keep them close enough to an altar. Orcish characters lack penalties for [[cannibalism]] and stand to gain a lot more from [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|same-race sacrifice]], including maximizing [[Luck]] and summoning peaceful [[demon lords]] and [[foocubi]]. The Orctown altar in particular is a good candidate for player orcs to use - be sure to convert it with a non-orcish corpse first, though, as same-race sacrifice does not convert an unaligned altar and you will take a -2 Luck penalty.

==History==
The hill orc is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]], where the various orcish monsters were first differentiated from each other.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Orc}}
The orcs in ''NetHack'' are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which in turn are based on their portrayal in the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], six hill orcs generate in the halls of [[Grund's Stronghold]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], 20-24 hill orcs will appear on the fourth level of the [[Ruins of Moria]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Orcs, bipeds with a humanoid appearance, are related to the
goblins, but much bigger and more dangerous.  The average orc
is only moderately intelligent, has broad, muscled shoulders,
a short neck, a sloping forehead and a thick, dark fur.
Their lower eye-teeth are pointing forward, like a boar's.
Female orcs are more lightly built and bare-chested.  Not
needing any clothing, they do like to dress in variegated
apparels.  Suspicious by nature, orcs live in tribes or
hordes.  They tend to live underground as well as above
ground (but they dislike sunlight).  Orcs can use all weapons,
tools and armors that are used by men.  Since they don't have
the talent to fashion these themselves, they are constantly
hunting for them.  There is nothing a horde of orcs cannot
use.

The '''Mordor orc''', {{monsym|Mordor orc}}, is a form of [[orc]] found in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are slightly stronger than [[hill orc]]s, but much [[slow]]er.

==Generation==
Mordor orcs have a 2/3 chance of [[Monster starting inventory|being generated with]] each of the following: a [[scimitar]], an [[orcish shield]], a [[knife]], and an [[orcish chain mail]]. They also have the standard 50% chance of starting with an [[orcish helm]].{{refsrc|makemon.c|350|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

The [[Orcish Town]] variant of Minetown features large numbers of named Mordor orcs inside the town walls, and they can also be encountered elsewhere in the [[Gnomish Mines]] and the main branch, often with looted Minetown items such as [[key]]s, [[candles]] and depleted [[wands]].

==Strategy==
:See also: [[Hill orc#Strategy|Hill orc strategy]]
The larger pool of equipment Mordor orcs can be generated with mean that, on average, Mordor orc hordes generally makes for a more difficult fight than against a group of [[hill orc]]s. However, the same strategies still apply and will likely prove just as effective; still, the player will want to be slightly more cautious and perhaps better armored.

As with other orcs, Mordor orc corpses can be a decent source of nutrition, and orcish characters may want to consider using them for sacrifices in Orcish Town after converting the altar using a non-orcish corpse.

The '''Uruk-hai''', {{monsym|uruk-hai}}, is a form of [[Orc (monster class)|orc]] found in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are stronger and faster than both [[hill orc]]s and [[Mordor orc]]s.

==Generation==
Uruk-hai have independent {{frac|3}} chances of [[Monster starting inventory|generating with]] each of the following items: [[orcish cloak]], [[orcish short sword]], [[iron shoes]], [[orcish bow]] (with {{rn1|12|3}} [[poison]]ed [[orcish arrow]]s), and [[Uruk-hai shield]]. In addition, they have a {{frac|2}} chance of receiving an [[orcish helm]], as all orcs do.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|396|nethack=3.6.6}}

The [[Orcish Town]] variant of Minetown features large numbers of named Uruk-Hai, which can also be encountered elsewhere in the [[Gnomish Mines]] and the main branch, and they will often have looted items such as [[key]]s, [[candles]] and depleted [[wands]] in their inventory.

== Strategy ==
:''See also: [[Hill orc#Strategy|Hill orc strategy]]''
Like other orcs, the larger pool of equipment makes hordes of Uruk-hai more difficult to fight, and Uruk-hai are the fastest orcs to be generated in groups. However, they are still quite slow compared to an unburdened player and can still be beaten using similar strategies, though you will want to be decently armored and [[poison resistance|poison resistant]] to avoid a nasty [[instadeath]].

Drawing them into corridors is as viable as against any other group of orcs, but puts you at risk from poison arrow attacks; however, Uruk-hai lack poison resistance and are just as likely to hit each other with their arrows, if not more so. Facing an Uruk-Hai in melee will deter them from using their arrows, allowing you to pick them up and possibly use them against the rest once they are killed - this includes being felled by their comrades' shots. As with other orcs, Uruk-hai corpses can be a decent source of nutrition, and orcish characters may want to consider using them for sacrifices in Orcish Town.

==History==
The Uruk-hai first appears with the other types of orc in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Uruk-hai}}
Like the other orcs of ''NetHack'', the Uruk-hai are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which in turn are based on their portrayal in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world of Middle-earth; they first appear in the setting's Third Age as a need breed of Orc that was larger, more powerful and did not share the aversion to daylight common to other orcs.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]] and derived variants such as [[SlashTHEM]], five Uruk-hai appear in the halls of [[Grund's Stronghold]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], Uruk-hai are likely to be among the random orcs generated on each floor of the [[Ruins of Moria]] branch.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Uruk-hai are regarded as human for purposes of [[sacrifice]] and [[cannibalism]].

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Uruk-hai are capable of entering [[berserker rage]]s; this increases its damage for that round of attacks, but also makes it possible that they might hit other monsters around them.

The '''orc shaman''', {{monsym|orc shaman}}, is a low level [[monster spell|spell-casting]] [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. 

== Generation ==
The orc shaman has a 50% chance to be [[Monster starting inventory|created with]] an [[orcish helm]], but will not receive a [[weapon]] like other [[Orc (monster class)|orcs]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|399|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|427|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Randomly generated orc shamans may be peaceful towards [[Orc (starting race)|orcish]] player characters.

In addition to normal generation, orcish shamans may also appear in [[throne room]]s, and two to six orc shamans will be generated near the desecrated [[temple]] in the [[Orcish Town]] variant of Minetown.

==Strategy==
Similar to other low-level casters such as [[kobold shaman]]s and [[gnomish wizard]]s, orc shamans cast [[psi bolt]] and [[healing]], and their spells frequently fail due to their low speed and low level - as such, they are usually not a significant threat. Be careful not to get [[stunned]] while dealing with groups of monsters, however. As with other orcs, the corpse of an orc shaman is a good source of nutrition.

Orc shaman corpses make for worthwhile sacrifices in Orcish Town, especially for player orcs.

==History==
The orc shaman is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]], where the various orcish monsters were first differentiated from each other.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Orc}}
Like other orcs, the orc shaman is derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', in turn based on their portrayal in the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The tribal aspects of orcs, including shamanistic practices, were more established and built on in the ''Warcraft'' franchise created by Blizzard Entertainment.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
Five orc shamans generate in [[Grund's Stronghold]] - three appear in the halls, and the other two start within the throne room.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], orc shamans have identical stats to their appearance in vanilla ''NetHack'',<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/monst.c#L899 EvilHack 0.7.0 - monst.c, line 899]</ref> but the inclusion of more clerical spells makes them more of a potential threat. They possess [[telepathy]], and can be seen (and see you) if you have intrinsic telepathy - eating an orc shaman [[corpse]] or [[tin]] may also give intrinsic telepathy.

===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], [[Mage (GruntHack)|mages]] (and by extension shamans) are [[racial monster]]s, and orcs are eligible to generate as shamans.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], orc shamans also have telepathy, and can be seen (and see you) if you have intrinsic telepathy.
