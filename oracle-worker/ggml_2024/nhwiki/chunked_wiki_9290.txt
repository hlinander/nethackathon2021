'''Gauntlets of reflection''' are a type of [[glove]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. They are made of [[silver]] and have a random appearance when unidentified.

==Strategy==
Gauntlets of reflection are a rare but powerful piece of armor. Competition for equipment slots is tighter in SlashTHEM, making them easily one of the best gloves to get the essential [[reflection]] property. They can be well worth a wish, especially to free up other slots.

'''Nightingale''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. It is [[chaotic]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[katana]].

==Generation==
Nightingale is the guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Ninja]]s.

==Description==
'''Nightingale''' deals +3 damage against all monsters, with a 10% chance of dealing an extra 1d5 * 6 damage every attack. While the average damage of +6d5 vs +1d5 * 6 is the same (18), the damage output distribution is conceptually different as you will only get values of 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30.

When [[invoke]]d, Nightingale toggles [[invisibility]].

==Strategy==
Although Nightingale's potential for damage is high, the 10% chance makes its output generally pretty spiky. That being said, the average damage is still on par with that of other artifact weapons like [[Excalibur]], and the additional to-hit bonus and invisibility toggle can make Nightingale quite the powerful early- or mid-game weapon.

'''Spineseeker''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. It is [[chaotic]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[stiletto]]. It deals a flat extra 5 damage against all monsters, with a 20% chance of dealing an extra 1d5 damage and [[stunning]] the target for 1d5 rounds. A successful proc is indicated by the message '''"The gleaming blade cuts into <monster>'s <spine>"'''.

==Strategy==
While the overall damage of '''Spineseeker''' is fairly low, the 20% chance of stunning the target is pretty high which means there is a chance you can permanently freeze an enemy while you pummel it to death. This all makes it a pretty attractive off-hand weapon for #[[Twoweapon|two-weaponing]].

==Japanese==
The following is a list of those items with their Japanese names:

There are also some regular items that are uniquely Japanese. Once identified, these are described using their Japanese name, regardless of which [[role]] you are playing. These items are the following:
* [[ya]] ("bamboo arrow")
* [[yumi]] ("long bow")
* [[katana]] ("samurai sword")
* [[tsurugi]] ("long samurai sword")
* [[shuriken]] ("throwing star")

Additionally some pieces of dialog are also changed. On losing a level or dying, you receive the message "Sayonara", instead of the usual "Goodbye"; when starting or loading a game, it greets you with "Konichi wa"; and friendly shopkeepers and priests greet you with "Irasshaimase".

==Pirate==
Pirate names for items following a nautical theme:

{| class="prettytable"
! Pirate !! English
|-
| [[wikipedia:Belaying pin|belaying pin]] || [[club]]
|-
| [[wikipedia:Buckler|buckler]] || [[small shield]]
|-

|-
| [[wikipedia:Rum|potion of rum]] || [[potion of booze]]
|-
| [[wikipedia:Hardtack|sea biscuit]] || [[cram ration]]
|}

The [[Pirate]] patch treats the cutlass as a kind of [[scimitar]]. In real life, the [[wikipedia:Cutlass|cutlass]] is usually a much shorter sword than the [[wikipedia:Scimitar|scimitar]], though both usually have conspicuously curved blades. Both are also related to the [[saber]]--the scimitar through the Persian ''shamshir'' and Turkish ''kilij'', which were probably influenced by cavalry sabers used by the Byzantine Empire--but NetHack treats the scimitar/cutlass and saber as distinct weapons. [[NetHack is not real life]].

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Corsair fighting [[Spearathan]] in the [[Grotto of Souls]] for the [[Pearl of Wisdom]], a neutral [[ring of wisdom]] which provides [[magic resistance]] when carried, [[shock resistance]] and [[SPFX_HPHDAM|half physical damage]] when worn, and can be [[invoke|invoked]] as a [[scroll of magic mapping]].

[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/e55b2b522cea66b463dd8a81d74f9b8ad7fa7bb3/include/artilist.h#L783|SlashTHEM artilist.h line 783]

==Strategy==

The early game of a Corsair plays much like a [[Rogue]]. Their +1 [[daggers]] are superb for dealing with early enemies at range in addition to their helpful oilskin sack. However, their limited HP will become a factor during the midgame unless they can find ways to compensate for it. Their first sacrifice gift [[Queen's Guard]] is a definite boon for damage output but is not incredibly impressive. If their build allows for it, Corsairs can take advantage of their expert skill in [[twoweapon]] to increase their damage output significantly to bridge the midgame deficit. Their quest artifact [[Pearl of Wisdom]] grants slotless [[magic resistance]], which can free up other precious equipment slots. Its other properties are less interesting. The base item [[ring of wisdom]] is not generally a desirable use of a ring slot, and the [[half physical damage]] is slightly overshadowed by the [[Hand of Vecna]]. The invokable [[magic mapping]] is typically a convenience boost by the time they acquire it, but can be handy for mapping SlashTHEM's lengthy [[gehennom]] especially in locating [[Vlad's Tower]].

==Gods==
The SlashTHEM pantheon for Corsair is taken from Haitian Vodou[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou].

'''Queen's Guard''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. It is [[lawful]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[rapier]]. It deals a flat +6 damage against all monsters and has a +6 to-hit.

==Generation==
'''Queen's Guard''' is given to [[Corsair|Corsairs]] as their first [[sacrifice gift]].

==Strategy==
Queen's Guard is a pretty straightforward and powerful early game weapon. While the overall average damage output is a little less than something like [[Excalibur]], the high to-hit makes it a lot more consistent. Given that [[sabers|saber]] are generally a rarity, players who acquire a Queen's Guard early will likely not have had a chance to train the skill, so this makes an excellent first sacrifice gift to do just that until they can trade up for something like [[Greyswandir]].

{{trap

The '''arrow trap''' and '''dart trap''' are two similar [[traps]] that can fire [[projectile]]s.

==Generation==
Both traps can be generated on almost any level.

On the [[Ranger quest]], there are 2 guaranteed arrow traps on the home level and 2 more guaranteed on the locate level.

Dart traps are guaranteed on the following special levels:

* the [[Monk quest]] home level
* the [[Priest quest]] home level
* the [[Wizard quest]] locate level
* the [[Valley of the Dead]]

==Effects==
Arrow traps fire [[arrow]]s at you or whoever else steps on them, which generally do 1d6 damage.

Dart traps fire [[dart]]s that generally deal 1d3 damage, and have a 1 in 5 chance of being [[poison]]ed. The poison can potentially cause an [[instadeath]] to characters without [[poison resistance]].

Each time you or a monster triggers one of these traps, there is a {{frac|15}} chance that the trap will disappear. Any projectile that hits you or a monster is guaranteed to be lost. {{refsrc|src/trap.c|961|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect of arrow trap on player}} {{refsrc|src/trap.c|986|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect of dart trap on player}} {{refsrc|src/trap.c|2212|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect of arrow trap on monster}} {{refsrc|src/trap.c|2228|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect of dart trap on monster}}

==Removal==

Use the [[untrap|#untrap]] command, or trigger it repeatedly until it runs out of projectiles.

While standing on or adjacent to the square with the trap, successfully untrapping an arrow or dart trap will yield a large supply of projectiles (50&nbsp;&minus; [[rnl]](50)){{refsrc|src/trap.c|4252|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Disarming a shooting trap}}. The average number of projectiles you obtain by disarming is dependent on [[luck]], but is higher than the average number you obtain by stepping on the trap until it disappears.

==Strategy==
These traps can be a useful source of projectiles. However there is a risk of being hit by a projectile and suffering damage. Dart traps in particular are dangerous to adventurers lacking poison resistance.

==History==
Both arrow and dart traps were introduced in [[Hack 1.0]].

==Messages==

{{message|<An arrow/A little dart> shoots out at you!|You triggered an arrow or dart trap.}}

{{message|<monster> is hit by <an arrow/a dart>!|A monster triggered an arrow or dart trap.}}

==xNetHack==
{{main|XNetHack#Trap_changes|l1=xNetHack §&nbsp;Trap changes}}
Dart and arrow traps generate with 15+1d20 ammo. Ammo that comes out of a launcher trap is stored as one stack, so its ammo will all be identical and you will get the same amount of items from it whether you repeatedly trigger it or untrap it.

Poison darts from traps deal Con damage 60% of the time and higher HP damage when they don't deal Con damage. However, poison dart traps don't appear until depth 7.

When disarming a trap that shoots ammo (e.g. a dart trap), the ammo is placed into your inventory instead of on the floor.

The '''vampire''' is a [[monster class]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' represented by an uppercase V glyph ({{white|V}}). The class contains the following monsters:{{refsrc|src/monst.c|1843|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

* {{monsymlink|vampire}}
* {{monsymlink|vampire lord}}
* {{monsymlink|Vlad the Impaler}}
* {{monsymlink|vampire mage}} ([[deferred]] monster)

Vampires are designated internally by the macro '''S_VAMPIRE'''.{{refsrc|include/monsym.h|62|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Common traits==
Vampires are [[chaotic]] [[Human (monster attribute)|human]] [[undead]] - they are [[strong]], [[breathless]], capable of [[flying]] and [[regeneration]], and possess [[sleep resistance]] and [[poison resistance]]. All vampires are [[chaotic]]-aligned and vulnerable to [[silver]] weapons; they have a characteristic [[drain life (monster attack)|life-draining]] bite, and will [[follow]] you to other levels if on an adjacent square. 

Vampires are [[shapeshifter]]s and can [[polymorph]] at will into [[vampire bat]]s or [[fog cloud]]s - vampire lords can additionally shapeshift into [[wolves]]. They often turn into their animal forms when outside of the player's sight, and shift into fog cloud form to flow under locked or inaccessible [[door]]s; if killed in either of these forms, they will resurrect in vampire form.

Standing on any [[altar]] [[scare]]s vampires, similar to standing on [[Elbereth]] or a [[scroll of scare monster]].{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|154|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} 

Vampires are technically designated as [[corpseless]] in the code - any non-unique vampire that is killed will "revert" to a tainted [[Human (monster)|human]] [[corpse]]. [[Human (starting race)|Human]] characters killed by a member of the vampire class arise as a vampire instead of a ghost in any bones file that is created.{{refsrc|src/end.c|517|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

===Generation===
Non-unique vampires are among the various undead that can generate in [[graveyard]]s.

In addition to hosting graveyards, the following levels also generate random {{white|V}} on level creation:

* Three random types of vampire are generated in the [[Valley of the Dead]].
* Three random vampires appear within the left inner chambers of [[Asmodeus' Lair]].
* Six random vampires rest behind hidden doors within [[Vlad's Tower]].
* Three random vampires are also generated in [[Moloch's Sanctum]].
* Three random vampires appear on the [[Astral Plane]].

===As a polymorph form===
[[Player]]s in the form of any vampire will "scrawl in blood" rather than "write in the dust" when [[engraving]]; they are also [[Warned of monster type|warned of]] any {{monclasslink|@}}, and will turn into [[vampire bat]]s if they polymorph without [[polymorph control]].

==Strategy==
Vampires often make for annoying fights, due to their ability to rob you of [[experience level]]s unless you have [[drain resistance]], e.g. from an artifact weapon like [[Excalibur]]; [[MC]]3 is the next best option in the event you lack this resistance. Vlad the Impaler is the worst offender by far, due to his high speed and [[covetous]] behavior.

Vampires represent a tempting target for a blessed [[scroll of genocide]] - though not as vicious as [[mind flayer]]s or [[arch-lich]]es, vampire lords in particular can still be troublesome; if you are early enough in the game, you may consider do so in order to increase the amount of [[wraith]]s generated in [[graveyard]]s.

===As pets===
Vampires are decently strong as pets, with vampire lords being significantly popular choices - vampires need only two levels to [[grow up]] into vampire lords. However, pet vampires will shapeshift as normal unless you are wearing a [[ring of protection from shape changers]] - in their other forms, they are weak fighters that cannot wear armor, and will break body armor if they shift into wolves. A tame vampire will not shapeshift back to humanoid form unless killed or forced back to normal by the ring of protection from shapechangers - players planning to keep vampire pets should identify this ring as soon as possible.

Vampires' huamnoid forms are their strongest by far, with good base AC and access to all armor giving them the potential for high survivability. However, their silver weakness and lack of elemental resistances can easily work against them.

===As a polyform===
Both available vampire forms are good for players with [[polymorph control]] - they can wear armor and wield non-silver weapons, and their regeneration, flight, breathlessness, and lack of hunger are all unambiguous boons. The vampire lord is a strictly better choice in all respects, with slightly more AC and speed. The vampires' silver weakness is just as much a danger to you as it is to other vampires, however, and you will need to avoid engaging certain monsters such as [[cockatrices]] in melee.

==History==
The base vampire has been present in the game since Hack121, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]], while the vampire lord and Vlad the Impaler first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]]. The vampire mage's deferred data can be found in the source code as early as [[NetHack 3.3.0]].

In 3.4.3 and some previous versions, along with some variants based on those versions, vampires were often used in [[drain for gain]] strategies and were thus a prevalent choice for abusing the [[polyself bug]], to the point that they were specifically mentioned in the bug's official description. Both were addressed and fixed in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

Vampires' shapeshifting abilities were added in 3.6.0; this makes them somewhat better pets in previous versions and some variants based on them, as they will not shapeshift out of any armor you give them. There are two related bugs to this, both fixed in [[NetHack 3.6.1]]:

* Genociding vampires and/or vampire lords would caused currently shapeshifted ones to become unkillable, as they could not return to vampire form properly. This was fixed in {{commit|757e6f9c4da1417b3b127dae8834697fea5e284c|commit 757e6f9}}.
* Shapeshifters such as [[chameleon]]s and other monsters that polymorphed into vampires would remain stuck in that form - e.g., shapeshifters would not take on new forms, a polymorph-produced vampire would not shift to bat or fog forms, and so on. This was fixed in {{commit|885de116e1e93faa8ad5dc2685d16a9f553c50ed|commit 885de11}} and {{commit|45ba0addf25a6a0f29b6de793524e5250a6c039a|commit 45ba0ad}}.

==Messages==
For the purpose of these messages, a vampire regards you as "kindred" if you are in the form of a vampire yourself, and considers you a "night child" if you are in the form of a [[wolf]] (including [[winter wolves]] and [[winter wolf cub|their cubs]]).

The following five messages occur if you chat to a tame vampire in its humanoid form:

{{message|Good evening to you Master!|You are kindred, and it is [[night]].}}
{{message|Good day to you Master. Why do we not rest?|You are kindred, and it is day.}}
{{message|<Child of the night,> I can stand this craving no longer!|It is [[midnight]], with the prefixed message occurring if you are in wolf form.}}
{{message|<Child of the night,> I beg you, help me satisfy this growing craving!|As above during the night, but it is not midnight.}}
{{message|<Child of the night,> I find myself growing a little weary.|As above, but it is day.}}

These messages occur if you chat to a peaceful vampire:

{{message|Good feeding <brother/sister>!|You are kindred, and it is night.}}
{{message|How nice to hear you, child of the night!|You are a night child, and it is night.}}
{{message|I only drink... potions.|You are neither kindred nor a night child, or it is day time.}}

These messages occur when chatting to a hostile vampire:

{{message|This is my hunting ground that you dare to prowl!|You are kindred.}}
{{message|<Young> Fool! Your silver sheen does not frighten me!|You are polymorphed into a [[silver dragon]]; "Young" is appended if you are polymorphed into a [[baby silver dragon]].}}

For chatting to hostile vampires in other forms, one of the two following sets of messages is randomly chosen, with the first set depending on your [[body parts]]:

{{message|I vant to suck your life force!|You are polymorphed into a [[sphere]] or [[vortex]].}}
{{message|I vant to suck your juices!|You are polymorphed into a [[jelly]] or [[fungus]].}}
{{message|I vant to suck your blood!|You are in a form that is not any of the above.<ref>This quote comes from [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109707/quotes#qt0363244 the 1994 film ''Ed Wood''], but is [http://www.filmsite.org/moments0.html commonly mis-attributed] to Bela Lugosi's titular character in the 1931 ''Dracula''.</ref>}}

Otherwise, their response is one of the following:

{{message|I vill come after a <man/woman> without regret!|You are a human. <ref>This "famous vampire quote" appears to be an oblique allusion to [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110148/quotes?item=qt0337704 the 1994 film ''Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles''], as determined by [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/1f5b9653bb1db508 this RGRN discussion] regarding Vlad.</ref>}}
{{message|I vill come after a <race> without regret!|You are polymorphed or naturally non-human.}}

==Variants==
Many variants add the [[Vampire (starting race)|vampire]] as a playable race and add the deferred vampire mage, often alongside other members.

===SLASH'EM===
{{main|Vampire (starting race in SLASH'EM)}}
Vampires are a starting [[race]] added in [[SLASH'EM]] - this means that [[Doppelganger (starting race)|Doppelgangers]] cannot polymorph into vampires, though they can still polymorph into any other member of the vampire monster class. In addition, there are four new vampires added to the monster class:

* {{monsymlink|Vampire mage}}, a spellcaster who notably has access to the [[summon nasties]] spell on top of three attack per turn, including a stronger claw and bite that can drain levels.
* {{monsymlink|Fire vampire}}, which is a [[H.P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] alien rather than undead, though it shares the vampiric weakness to silver. Fire vampires can use unreflectable fireball attacks, move twice as fast as a normal hero, and have five attacks per turn, including fiery touches.
* {{monsymlink|Star vampire}}, which is another extraterrestrial from Lovecraft's works, and similarly weak to silver. They lack the fire vampire's speed and any elemental affinity, but can attack six times per turn with three drain life attacks mixed in.
* {{monsymlink|Count Dracula}}, the [[Undead Slayer]] [[quest nemesis]] and another monster based on the 1897 Bram Stoker novel ''Dracula''.

Eight random vampires will generate on the [[Chaotic Quest]].

Most vampires [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|hits monsters as +x weapons]]: base vampires hit as +2, Count Dracula hits as +4, and all other {{white|V}} hit as +3. Base vampires also [[Need +x weapon to hit|require a +2 weapon to be hit]], while every other vampire except Count Dracula requires a +3 weapon. Tamed vampires are now [[traitor]]ous and have a change to turn on you, making them possibly perilous choices for pets while at lower levels.

Undead vampires are often generated with [[opera cloak]]s and can provide a valuable method of farming them, especially if they are randomized into the [[cloak of magic resistance]]; the tradeoff is the vampires in question being harder to dispatch depending on the cloak, particularly vampire mages. Spells that don't destroy potential loot, such as the {{spell of|acid stream}} spell, are good substitutes for the usual {{spell of|magic missile}} in such scenarios.

The [[wooden stake]] is a [[dagger]]-type weapon that does 1d6 extra damage to any vampire, on top of an additional +2 damage and a 10% chance of instakilling them if the wielder is an [[Undead Slayer]], has Expert skill in dagger, or is using [[The Stake of Van Helsing]].

====Vampire diets====
{{main|Potion of blood}}
Player vampires and players [[polymorph]]ed into undead vampires can fly and do not need to breathe, but they cannot eat solid food and have to rely on fresh blood as a food source. SLASH'EM adds the [[potion of blood]] and potion of vampire blood as nutritional replacements for vampires: Player vampires receive potions of vampire blood in place of the food other monsters would start with, and can use the [[draw blood]] [[technique]] to create one by draining one of their levels; undead vampires in the dungeon may generate with either potion. Non-player vampires of any kind will drink non-cursed vampire blood to restore 2-10 HP, and gain nothing from drinking cursed potions. Player vampires gain 20 nutrition from an uncursed potion of blood and 30 from a blessed one; an uncursed potion of vampire blood grants 800 nutrition points (400 if diluted), and a blessed potion additionally increases your HP and max HP by the same amount as a level gain.

A non-vampire player that attempts to drink a potion of blood will be given 10d8 (more) turns of nausea. A non-vampire drinking vampire blood will instead polymorph into a vampire. Non-vampires also suffer a −3 alignment penalty if neutral, while lawfuls and [[Monk]]s take a −15 alignment penalty and anger their god. The polymorph is "semi-permanent" and will last until your HP is reduced to 0.

Vampires may also get nutrition from combat using their ''bite'' attack in combat, and can drain blood from corpses. A corpse that is left alone too long will have its blood ''coagulate'', rendering it useless as a nutrition source. While blood consumed in this manner provides a very small nutritional value, the drained corpses are still eligible for sacrifice, reducing the need to weigh staying full against sacrificing. As vampires are human undead, the usual penalties apply for draining other humans, as well as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s.

===UnNetHack===
{{main|Vampire (starting race in UnNetHack)}}
As with SLASH'EM, [[UnNetHack]] also adds the vampire as a starting race, and randomly generated vampires are also often generated with opera cloaks. The same conditions for player and polyself vampires apply as in SLASH'EM, as do the conditions for vampires generating with potions of blood.

A non-vampire drinking vampire blood will polymorph into a vampiric monster depending on the potion's beatitude - blessed potions will polymorph them into a vampire lord; an uncursed potion will turn them into a vampire, as in SLASH'EM; and a cursed potion will morph them into a vampire bat. The same penalties for non-chaotic characters apply.

===dNetHack===
{{main|Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)}}
In [[dNetHack]], vampires are also a starting race. Pet vampires will drain corpses for nutrition the same way a player vampire does, with similar conditions (i.e. corpses must be less than 3 turns of age and have blood).

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, [[SlashTHEM]] adds the following vampires:

* {{green|V}} [[vogon]]
* {{brightgreen|V}} [[vogon lord]]
* {{gray|V}} [[nosferatu]]
* {{magenta|V}} [[Prostetnik Vogon Jeltz]]

None of the new vampires that can be tamed are capable of treachery.

In [[dNetHack]], the '''potion of blood''' is a type of [[potion]] that contains the blood of a specific [[monster]], and appears as a "blood-red potion" when unidentified. Similar to a [[tin]], each potion of blood must be fully [[identified]] in order to reveal which creature's blood it contains.

==Generation==
Potions of blood makes up 1.8% of all random potions in the dungeon.

Applying a [[tinning kit]] to a monster [[corpse]] with blood will always produce a potion of the monster's blood alongside a tin of its flesh.

All [[Vampire (monster class)|vampires]] have a {{frac|2|3}} chance of generating with at least one potion of blood - they may carry anywhere from one to four potions, with an equal chance of each quantity.

==Description==
Quaffing a potion of blood acts similarly to opening a tin to eat, as noted above - you are told what monster's blood it smells like if you are a [[Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)|vampire]] or any non-herbivorous race, and then given a yes/no prompt for drinking it.

The full changelog can be found at https://github.com/demogorgon22/notdnethack/blob/master/changelog.txt

== New races ==

Adds Salamander, Ent and Etherealoid as playable races.

== New roles ==

Adds the Illithanachronounbinder role.

=== Illithanachronounbinder ===

They can be humans, orcs, dwarves, elves, drows, gnomes, half-dragons, incantifiers, ents or salamanders. They always start as lawful.

You play as a mind flayer of your chosen race, having all of the abilities of your race ''plus'' the mind flayer ones.
They are immune to [[madness]] and [[sanity|insanity]], their sanity is always locked at 100 and they can not contract madnesses.[https://github.com/demogorgon22/notdnethack/blob/2ddd34409419b16007a058c614d6daaa3c61fc62/src/attrib.c#L1349]

A key mechanic is that you need to summon [[Spirits (dNetHack)|spirits]] to be able to level up.
Additionally, they are always lawful and can not change their alignment in any way. Due to their god being fallen, praying and sacrificing is impossible.
BUC-testing on altars still works as usual, though.

==== Abilities ====

The following abilities are gained by levelling up:

*XL 1: [[ESP]], tentacle attack, mind blast ability
**The tentacle attack automatically triggers in melee, giving nutrition to the user if the target has a brain. Additionally it may kill the target by [[brainlessness]]. You can not choke or vomit by getting nutrition this way.
* Mind blast works identically to the [[Madman (dNetHack role)#Psychic powers|ability madmen have]] but is stronger due to the player being a mind flayer.
*XL 4: Psionic pulse ability
**Psionic pulse is a directional psionic attack which deals damage and is able to knock monsters back.
*XL 7: Psionic echolocation
**Psionic echolocation works identically to the [[chiropteran]] echolocation ability.
*XL 10: [[Flying]]
*XL 12: Psionic craze ability
**Psionic craze allows you to "psionically torture" a monster, which may make it flee.
*XL 14: [[Reflection]]
*XL 15: Telekinesis ability
**Telekinesis allows picking up items from a distance.
*XL 17: [[Teleport control]]
*XL 20: All thrown items return

==== Rank titles ====

The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1–2: Exorcist
*XL 3–5: Unbinder
*XL 6–9: Vestige Vanquisher
*XL 10–13: Spirit Killer
*XL 14–17: Mind Flayer
*XL 18–21: Psionaut
*XL 22–25: Void Voider
*XL 26–29: Telekinetic
*XL 30: Keeper of the Gate

==== Spirits ====

In order to be able to level up, you need to summon spirits.
When spirits are vanquished, they will drop useful things.
Once summoned, they do not need to be killed in order to be able to advance to the next [[XL]].

The role starts with knowing Ahazu's and Amon's seal and will learn more in alphabetical order by gaining levels.

*XL 1: Ahazu drops 4-5 food rations.
*XL 1: Amon drops a [[frost horn]], with a high chance of it having a non-standard material (such as gold or mithril).
*XL 2: Andrealphus drops a sensor pack and a [[can of grease]].
*XL 3: Andromalius drops 5-15 daggers and a sack.
*XL 4: Astaroth drops 2-3 upgrade kits.
*XL 5: Balam drops two large daggers and a large robe.
*XL 6: Berith drops the Crown Of Berith, a golden [[helmet]] which prevents brainsucking attacks (useful for the quest) and is able to be enchanted to +7.
*XL 7: Buer drops a regular [[amulet of life saving]] and The Talisman of Buer, an amulet of life saving which confers [[sustain ability]] and health regeneration when worn. It can be invoked for healing, just like [[dNetHack artifacts#Release from Care|Release from Care]].
*XL 8: Chupoclops drops a large number of [[cave spider]] eggs.
*XL 9: Dantalion drops the Dread of Dantalion, an intelligent, lawful two-handed sword with +1d10 damage that acts like a [[scroll of scare monster]] when dropped.
*XL 10: Echidna
*XL 11: Eden, drops branchporting Eden's Scales
*XL 12: Enki
*XL 13: Eurynome drops fancy shoes
*XL 14: Eve
*XL 15: Fafnir
*XL 16: Huginn and Muninn
*XL 18:	Iris
*XL 19:	Jack
*XL 20:	Malphas
*XL 21:	Marionette
*XL 22:	Mother
*XL 23:	Naberius
*XL 24:	Orthos
*XL 25:	Ose
*XL 26:	Otiax
*XL 27:	Paimon
*XL 28:	Shiro
*XL 29:	Simurgh
*XL 30:	Tenebrous
*XL 31:	Ymir (?)

==== Quest ====

The Ulitharid sees you fighting Menzoberranzan for the Elder Cerebral Fluid, a dilithium crystal which does not do anything on its own.

There will be many hostile mind flayers ("adversaries") and so-called vilithids, which are vampire mind flayers. They can drain your levels in addition to sucking your brain.

== Dungeon changes ==

=== The village ===

[[Dungeon level]] 4 is guaranteed to be a village of friendlies of your own race. It contains a couple of houses, a fountain and the travelling wizard.

The fountain will be replaced with a magic portal after talking with the wizard.

[[Chatting]] with the peaceful inhabitants of the village will give you hints about what is waiting in the adventure branches.

=== Adventure branches ===

The stairs to the [[Gnomish Mines]] are replaced with a magic portal to a branch the player chose while taking to the travelling wizard.
Each of the branches contains a unique reward, a different set of enemies and obstacles.

The chosen branch will affect how the base level of the windowless tower and [[minetown]] will look.

==== Ice Caves ====

Enemies: Mainly cold-themed, including [[White naga hatchling]]s, [[white naga]]s, [[brown mold]]s, [[chill bug]]s, [[baby white dragon]]s, [[ice vortex|ice vortices]]

Minetown: Shopkeepers are frost giants or ice trolls instead of humans. The altar is being watched over by two hostile [[ice devil]]s and fenced in with iron bars. The corner of said cage are trees. A river is flowing through the town.

Boss: Abominable Snowman

Reward: The Abominable Veil: a [[Cloak of displacement]] conveying [[cold resistance]].

Windowless tower: Trees replaced with walls, the floor is ice.

==== Black Forest ====

Enemies: [[Werecreature]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[horse]]s, [[plant]]s (mainly razorwines and weeping willows)

Boss: Tulip Poplar

Reward: Quarterstaff with 2d6 extra damage.

==== Gnomish Mines ====

Almost unchanged from the original. Mines End was replaced with a maze-like but static structure of corridors and a throne room containing Raggo in the southeast. The corridors contain gems and gold.

==== Dismal Swamp ====

Enemies: [[Snake]]s, [[kobold]]s, some [[orc]]s and birds (mostly [[parrot]]s and [[raven]]s).

Minetown: Swampy, has two shops and a large stone structure on the northern part of the level, housing both a temple and the stairs down.

Boss: Kroo the Kobold King

Reward: Ring of alacrity conveying poison resistance.

Windowless tower: Swampy, but mostly traversible.

==== Archipelago ====

Enemies: [[Snake]]s, [[parrot]]s, [[monkey]]s

Minetown: Very small. '''The whole area will flood if any of the outer walls are damaged, swallowing loot and monsters alike.'''

Boss: Archipelago Ancient

Reward: The Gillystone, an emerald which conveys [[magical breathing]] and [[swimming]] when carried.

Windowless tower: Sand and lots of water.

Theoretically they can be all be joined regardless of alignment, but each cult has an alignment of deities that accept worship of the cult god alongside them; gods of mismatched alignments regard it the same way as [[Sacrifice|sacrificing]] to a rival deity. There are currently two cults, one [[chaotic]] and one [[lawful]].

Cults differ from a normal [[religion]] in a few key ways
#All cults do not give out their boons at random. Instead, they have a unique holy symbol that acts as your point of contact with the cult mechanics. These holy symbols may be (a)pplied to access a menu where you can select boons, so long as you have the favor for it.
#Rather than giving [[gifts]] randomly when the conditions are met, valid sacrifices to a cult deity build up Favor, which functions similarly to [[piety]] from [[FIQhack]]. Using the holy symbol to acquire a boon spends accumulated favor.
#There are two types of boons: major and minor. Minor boons only require sufficient favor to be granted; major boons require an amount of lifetime favor to be earned before they are eligible for selection, using up favor just like a minor boon.
#Favor is accumulated more slowly while you have existing favor; good cultists claim their gifts as soon as possible, and eventually greater gifts will come to them.
#All boons are very taxing on [[sanity]]. Expect to be insane for a good while if you go all in on occultism.
#A [[helm of opposite alignment]] will allow you to sacrifice to a cross-aligned cult god, but the most essential boons from each cult will sacrifice enemies as part of their function, which limits the functionality of this. However, [[binder|Binders]], [[anachrononaut|Anachrononauts]], and [[madman|Madpeople]] that follow the path of detestation can freely interact with all cults as they wish, as they will never suffer the effects of cross-aligned sacrifice.

== The Black Mother ==

[[The Black Mother]] is a chaotic aligned cult deity.

== The Silver Flame ==

[[The Silver Flame]] is a lawful aligned cult deity.

These racial quests and artifacts from [[SLASH 6]], as well as their associated monsters, were [[Defunct features (SLASH'EM)|originally deferred]] in [[SLASH'EM]] and removed at some point during SlashTHEM's lifespan; they were reintroduced in [https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/commit/c1f38b87191cb146098938a706851d9856080a1e commit c1f38b8] and slated for possible future use. SlashTHEM currently has a [[Lunatic]] role that acts as a successor to the [[Lycanthrope (starting race)|lycanthrope]] starting race - as Lunatics use the lycanthrope's racial quest, their quest artifact, leader, guardians, and nemesis are all unchanged.

All the listed features below are defunct unless marked otherwise.

==Starting races==
While many of the starting races from Slash'EM Extended were cut, some still have remnants of code left behind, and some others that are present in SlashTHEM were renamed and still retain some of their previous traits.

===Asgardian===
The '''Asgardian''' was a playable race that, among other things, had a 30% chance to gain a random intrinsic the first time they reached a given [[experience level]].

===Gigant===
{{main|Giant (starting race)#SlashTHEM}}
The '''gigant''' was a starting race that corresponded to playable giants; they were renamed to "giant" in SlashTHEM v0.9.3-0.9.4.

===Ogro===
{{main|Ogre (starting race)}}
The '''ogro''' was a starting race that corresponded to playable ogres; they were renamed to "giant" in SlashTHEM v0.9.3-0.9.4.

===Trollor===
{{main|Troll (starting race)}}
The '''trollor''' was a starting race that corresponded to playable trolls; they were renamed to "troll" in SlashTHEM v0.9.3-0.9.4.

==Starting roles==
While many roles were removed, some roles previously in Slash'EM Extended are still present in the code of SlashTHEM; two roles in particular were deferred pending a complete rewrite, according to comments by the developer.<ref name="Pokemon">[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/role.c#L952 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 role.c, line 952]</ref><ref name="Psion">[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/role.c#L1009 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 role.c, line 1009]</ref> [[Quest nemeses]] tied to some of these roles can be found within the code of [[monst.c]] as well.

===Goff===
The '''Goff''' was a role derived from ''[[wikipedia:My Immortal (fan fiction)|My Immortal]]'', an infamous ''Harry Potter'' fanfiction known for its convoluted narrative and constant digressions, and commonly cited as one of the worst works of fanfiction ever written; the work has also been speculated to be a satire or elaborate "troll" hoax. The work's author self-identified as "'''Tara Gilesbie'''" - this name was used for the Goff quest nemesis, {{black|T}}, who still exists within the code of monst.c in SlashTHEM.<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/monst.c#L6955 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 monst.c, line 6955]</ref>

===Psion===
The '''Psion''' was a role that does not seem to be related to the Psions of [[ZAPM]], and is slated for a potential rewrite in the future.<ref name="Psion"/>

The data of monst.c contains entries for the Psion quest leader and quest nemesis: the leader is the '''Psi Master''', {{black|@}}, and the nemesis is '''Master Sabrina''', {{brightmagenta|@}}.<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/monst.c#L6535 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 monst.c, line 6535]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/monst.c#L7061 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 monst.c, line 7061]</ref> Master Sabrina may be based on [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sabrina Sabrina], a Psychic-type Gym Leader from the ''Pokémon'' franchise.

===Pokemon===
The '''Pokemon''' was a role with a signature '''poke ball''' technique that it could use to try and tame monsters, and is slated for a potential rewrite in the future.<ref name="Pokemon"/> The poke ball technique had an increased chance of working on monsters with the M3_PETTY and M3_POKEMON tags, both of which are also unused in SlashTHEM, and references to the technique exist in the role's deferred data and a few other files within the game.

The data of monst.c contains entries for the Pokemon quest leader and quest nemesis, as well as the quest guardians: the leader is '''Dr. Wusiji''', {{magenta|@}}, the nemesis is '''Ho-Oh''', {{magenta|B}}, and the guardians are '''Pokemon trainers''', {{yellow|@}}.<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/monst.c#L6461 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 monst.c, line 6461]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/monst.c#L7222 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 monst.c, line 7222]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/monst.c#L7325 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 monst.c, line 7325]</ref>

In the ''Pokémon'' franchise, Pokémon trainers are people who catch the eponymous monsters to collect them and/or battle alongside them; the poke ball technique is meant to simulate the [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball Poké Balls] used to catch and store Pokémon. Ho-Oh is based on [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ho-Oh_(Pok%C3%A9mon) the legendary Pokémon of the same name] from the franchise, while Dr. Wusiji is the name used for [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Elm Professor Elm] in ''Pokémon Vietnamese Crystal'', a bootleg of one of the games infamous for its poor translation job.

===Zyborg===
The '''Zyborg''' was a role that gained random techniques from leveling up, among other traits. Their quest nemesis is '''Master Brain''', {{red|@}}, who still exists within the code of monst.c, and is based on [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Masterbrain the Masterbrain] from ''Fallout 3''.<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.7/src/monst.c#L7061 SlashTHEM 0.9.7 monst.c, line 7061]</ref>

==Techniques==
Of the [[technique]]s that were introduced in Slash'EM Extended, only a handful remain. Four of them - appraisal, booze, create ammo and world fall - are still listed among the defined techniques inherited from Slash'EM Extended in include/tech.h, with a reminder to possibly remove them at some point. However, the [[Booze (technique)|booze]] technique is still actively used, and serves as the signature technique of the [[Drunk]] role - the others are among the unused techniques listed below.

===Appraisal===
'''Appraisal''' is a technique that was available to nearly every race; unlike create ammo and worldfall, the functions of the technique were preserved, but are not used by any race or role in SlashTHEM.

Using this technique would allow you to determine the [[enchantment]] value or amount of charges for your currently wielded item. Its main use was for [[weapon]]s, though their enchantment could also be determined via the [[weapon practice]] technique on occasion; upon appraising a weapon, there would be a 200-turn timeout, and if used on something other than a weapon, it would take about 2000 turns instead. This timeout would still apply if the wielded item could not have an enchantment value or any amount charges (e.g. [[potion]]s), or if the enchantment or charge amount was already known.

===Create ammo===
'''Create ammo''' is a a technique that was available to a few roles, including the Pokemon. The technique would add (techlevel+1) [[bullet]]s to the inventory, unless it was full; every individual bullet had its own chance of being [[blessed]], [[cursed]] or having a random positive or negative [[enchantment]]. After use, the player would have to wait a random time in order to use it again; the timeout was usually around 500 turns.

===Invoke deity===
'''Invoke deity''' is a commented-out technique that was available to nearly every race; when used, it would hurt or heal you based on your [[alignment record]]. A positive alignment record resulted in healing and decreased timeout for [[prayer]], while a negative alignment record resulted in taking damage and ''increased'' prayer timeout - if you alignment record was exactly zero, nothing happened. Using this technique broke [[atheist]] [[conduct]], and had a timeout of about 3000 turns; negative effects would not (further) [[anger]] your [[god]].

===World fall===
'''World fall''' is a technique that was available to a few roles, including the Pokemon. The technique would kill all monsters on the current level, hostile and otherwise, with a level is lower than the technique's level; unique monsters and quest nemeses were immune. The actual number of turns after which it became reusable was random, but usually it took at least 10,000 turns to recharge.

{{religion}}
'''Orcus''' is the [[chaotic]] [[god]] of the [[Undertaker]] pantheon in [[SlashTHEM]].

==Origin==
Orcus was the god of the Estrucan and later Roman underworld, and a deity that punished broken oaths. As with Hades, Orcus's name was also used for the underworld itself; in later Roman tradition he was conflated with Dis Pater, who inspired the [[Dispater]] of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

Like many other deities associated with death and the underworld, his name was used for demons and other underworld beings, including the [[Orcus]] of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' that ''NetHack'' players are more familiar with. According to a side-note in one of [[Tolkien]]'s manuscripts published by his son Christopher, as well as an unpublished letter to Gene Wolfe, Orcus was believed to be the root of the older Anglo-Saxon term "[[orc]]", meaning demon - a notion Tolkien expressed skepticism towards in the latter source.

&&%s&& %s Unicode {149342 2022-12-13T00:52:43Z {679 Ray Chason} /* Current state of support */ Unicode observed not working on Curses for Windows {{wikipedia}}
'''Unicode''' is a character encoding that aims to represent every writing system that has ever been used. 

Beginning with [[NetHack 3.7.0]], the map can be configured to display any '''Unicode''' character to represent most map symbols - many writing systems will be of little use to ''NetHack'', but the extensive inventory of accented Latin letters and symbols should prove quite useful. With an appropriate font mapping to the [[wikipedia:Private Use Areas|Private Use Areas]], a Unicode-enabled map could in principle display [[tiles]] in the [[TTY]] and [[Curses]] ports.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicode support is still incomplete.}}

==Current state of support==

Unicode symbols are supported in the platforms and window ports indicated in the table below.
