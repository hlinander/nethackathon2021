&&%s&& %s Alignment record {147159 2022-08-03T11:38:47Z {4000251 Netzhack}  {{religion}}
Your '''alignment record''' refers to your standing with your [[god]]. It is often simply called alignment, but it is not the same as [[Alignment|lawful/neutral/chaotic]] status. Its initial value is 0 for [[Caveman|Cave(wo)men]], [[Priest]]s, [[Tourist]]s, [[Valkyrie]]s and [[Wizard]]s, and 10 for [[Archeologist]]s, [[Barbarian]]s, [[Healer]]s, [[Knight]]s, [[Monk]]s, [[Rogue]]s, [[Ranger]]s, and [[Samurai]]. Its maximum is initially 10, and its upper bound increases by 1 for every 200 game turns. It has no lower bound. The value cannot be found precisely (except in [[wizard mode]]), but [[enlightenment]] or a [[stethoscope]] can give you a clue. Additionally, your [[quest leader]] will not permit you to go on your [[quest]] if your alignment record is below 20. This means you cannot enter the quest before turn 2000, which places an absolute lower limit on [[speed ascension]]s.

Your alignment record gradually increases as you kill monsters, and decreases when you do actions your god disapproves of. This usually makes it easy to keep your record at the highest possible value, unless you have killed multiple peaceful monsters or are adhering to the [[pacifist]] conduct.

==Effects of alignment record==
Your alignment record factors into various important aspects of any given game:

* You cannot go on the [[quest]] if your alignment record is less than 20.
* The [[prayer#How your god decides what to grant|effect of a successful prayer]] depends on your alignment record:
** You cannot safely pray if your alignment record is negative; your god will smite you.
** If you pray with 0 alignment record, you have a [[Luck]]-dependent chance (see [[rnl]]) of your god either fixing one [[trouble|major problem]] or doing nothing.
** If your alignment record is positive and less than 4, your god will only fix one major problem.
** If your alignment record is at least 4, your god may, with a chance depending on your Luck and whether you are on a co-aligned [[altar]], fix more problems and possibly grant a favor.
** If you have no major or minor problems and your alignment record is at least 14, your god will grant a favor.  The set of possible favors (including "no favor") depends on your Luck.
** [[Crowning]] is a possible favor when your alignment record is at least 20 and you have at least 10 Luck.
* If you are [[smite]]d by an opposing god, you are more likely to receive worse effects the higher your alignment record is.
* Co-aligned monsters are more likely to be generated [[peaceful]] when your alignment record is high.
* If you attempt to convert a cross-aligned altar by [[sacrifice]] when you have negative alignment record, you will be permanently converted to the altar's alignment (if you have not already permanently converted yourself).
* Co-aligned artifacts will [[artifact blast|blast]] you if you have negative alignment record.

== Checking your alignment ==
[[Enlightenment]] by a wand or potion includes a statement of your alignment.  You can also apply a [[stethoscope]] or zap a [[wand of probing]] at yourself.

{|class="wikitable"
!Alignment statement!!Alignment range
|-
|  "You have transgressed." || &minus;9 or lower
|-
|  "You have sinned." || &minus;8 to &minus;4
|-
|  "You have strayed." || &minus;3 to &minus;1
|-
|  "You are nominally aligned." || 0
|-
|  "You are haltingly aligned." || 1 to 2
|-
|  "You are aligned." || 3
|-
|  "You are stridently aligned." || 4 to 8
|-
|  "You are fervently aligned." || 9 to 13
|-
|  "You are devoutly aligned." || 14 to 19
|-
|  "You are piously aligned." || 20 or higher
|}

If you have a negative alignment record and you probe yourself with a wand or a stethoscope, it will say you are "insufficiently" aligned without further subdivisions.

==Ways to alter your alignment==

In this table, MAX means your maximum alignment, which is 10&nbsp;+ {{sfrac|turns|200}}. This chart does not include the (large number of) monsters that you will get one or more alignment points for killing. Many of the following can have other effects as well, such as on [[luck]] or your god's [[anger]], but for brevity these are not shown here.

Generally, for a character not attempting a pacifist conduct, alignment will be very close to the maximum.

; You feel partially absolved.
If your god is not angry at you, but your alignment is negative, sacrificing monsters on a coaligned altar generally increases your alignment by the value of the sacrifice, up to a maximum of 0 alignment. See [[Sacrifice#Ordinary sacrifice|Sacrifice&nbsp;§ Ordinary sacrifice]] for details.

== Alignment gains from killing monsters ==
Normal alignment changes from killing monster are determined by the function <code>[[makemon.c#set_malign|set_malign(mtmp)]]</code>.  This is applied ''after'' the above modifiers.  So if you kill your quest leader, your alignment is actually set to &minus;{{sfrac|MAX|2}}&nbsp;&minus; 20.

[[Alignment#Monster alignment|Monster alignment]] is defined for each monster in [[monst.c]]. It is largely independent of monster difficulty. In the table below, <code>malign</code> refers to the absolute value of the monster's alignment, and <code>max(a,b)</code> refers to whichever of a or b is higher.

The alignment gain is calculated when a monster is generated.<ref name="monster generation">{{sourcecode|makemon.c|1067}} example of set_malign called at monster generation</ref> It is recalculated whenever a monster is tamed<ref name="taming">{{function|dog.c|tamedog}} taming (or making peaceful for untameable monsters) causes alignment gain to be recalculated</ref> or becomes peaceful.<ref name="taming"/><ref name="untrap">{{function|trap.c|reward_untrap}} monsters made peaceful by untrapping have alignment gain recalculated</ref> It is not recalculated when peaceful or tame monsters become hostile,<ref "setmangry">{{function|mon.c|setmangry}} angering monsters does not change alignment gain</ref> with the exception of the [[high priest]] of Moloch if he is angered when entering the [[temple]] in [[Moloch's Sanctum]].<ref name="sanctum">{{sourcecode|priest.c|352}} the high priest of Moloch's alignment gain is recalculated if you anger him by entering Moloch's Sanctum</ref> It is also not recalculated if you [[helm of opposite alignment|change alignment]], so the alignment values below are based on whether the monster was co-aligned ''at the time of its generation''.

{|class="wikitable"

|-
|all other monsters || &minus;3 &times; <code>max(3, malign)</code> if coaligned, else same as hostile || <code>max(3, malign)</code> || <code>malign</code>
|}

=== Examples ===
* [[Vlad the Impaler]]: 0 if you're chaotic (co-aligned, always hostile); +10 otherwise (Vlad's alignment is &minus;10{{refsrc|monst.c|2019}})
* A [[lichen]], a [[newt]], or [[Death (monster)|Death]]: +5 if you are lawful or chaotic (neutral, always hostile); 0 if you are neutral
* A [[gnome (monster)|gnome]] or a [[air elemental]]: 0 if you are lawful or chaotic (neutral, can be peaceful); -9 if you are neutral and it was generated peaceful (&minus;3&nbsp;&times; 3, from max(3, malign)), or +3 if it was generated hostile (from max(3, malign))
* The [[Minetown]] priest: &minus;15 (always peaceful, priest alignments are 5, 0, &minus;5)
* A peaceful [[golden naga]], and you are lawful: &minus;16 (&minus;1 for attacking a peaceful monster, &minus;3&nbsp;&times; the naga's alignment of 5{{refsrc|monst.c|1778}})
* A hostile golden naga, and you are lawful: +5 (the absolute value of the monster's alignment)
* A peaceful golden naga, and you are not lawful: +4 (&minus;1 for peaceful, +5 for the naga's alignment)
* A hostile golden naga, and you are not lawful: +5 (naga's alignment)

As long as you are killing monsters and commit no major violations (killing quest leader, pet, priest), you can safely assume that your alignment is positive. If you need to raise your alignment quickly, kill easy always-hostile monsters, such as fungi, insects, or non-pet canines and felines.

==FIQHack==

Alignment penalties are calculated slightly differently in [[FIQHack]].  If you receive a penalty, your alignment is first set to 0, and then the penalty is subtracted<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/865c9091803e844b66255e122877ae6c70950e51/libnethack/src/attrib.c#L733</ref>.

&&%s&& %s Monster difficulty {142452 2021-09-07T03:23:40Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* Difficulty values */ Vlad the Impaler drinks several potions of gain level!  Vlad the Impaler rises up, through the list!  (stats copied from [[Vlad the Impaler]] on the assumption that this page is the one out of date) A monster's '''difficulty''' is a number from 1 to 57 which represents the game's idea of how tough a monster is. It loosely correlates with a monster's [[monster level|base level]], but is often higher for monsters with special properties that might make them tougher.

Difficulty is primarily used in the [[normal mechanism]] of monster generation to decide whether a candidate monster is appropriately difficult for the player to encounter. A monster is "too strong" to be randomly generated when its difficulty is greater than the average of your [[experience level]] and your [[dungeon level]]. It is "too weak" to be randomly generated when its difficulty is less than your dungeon level divided by 6, rounded down. (For this purpose, once you have the [[Amulet of Yendor]] your dungeon level is considered to be that of the [[Sanctum]], and in the endgame to be the depth of the Sanctum plus half your experience level.) Most of the less common mechanisms of monster generation do not have similar limits.

Other effects of difficulty include:
* How much your god appreciates a [[sacrifice]]d corpse (the dead monster's experience level doesn't matter).
* Whether your god will be [[mollified]], if they are [[angry]]. You must sacrifice a monster corpse of difficulty 7 or greater (11 or greater if you are [[chaotic]]) in order to mollify the god.
* The type of [[offensive item|offensive]], [[defensive item|defensive]], or [[miscellaneous item]] a monster may receive.
* Whether a monster considers itself weak enough to try [[polymorph]]ing itself.

== Difficulty values ==

This is a list of [[monster]]s sorted by [[difficulty]], then by [[experience]] value.

This table was generated with the use of a modified version of [[makedefs]] to calculate experience values as well, and is believed by the author to be accurate.  If there are discrepancies between these and those listed in the articles, please correct the article.
