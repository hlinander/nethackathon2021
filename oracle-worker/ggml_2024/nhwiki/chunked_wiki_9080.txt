 "We need you to find the Temple of Nalzok, then, from there, travel
 to Nalzok's lair.  If you can manage to defeat Nalzok and return
 the Mitre of Holiness here, we can then drive off the legions of
 undead that befoul the land.
 "Go with <deity> as your guide, <playername>."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "You can prevail, if you rely on <deity>."
 "Remember that Nalzok has great magic at his command."
 "Be pure, my <son|daughter>."
 "Beware, the Temple of Nalzok is surrounded by a great graveyard."
 "You may be able to affect Nalzok with magical cold."
 "Acquire and wear the Mitre of Holiness if you can.  It will aid you
 against Nalzok."
 "Call upon <deity> when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
 "The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
 "Do not lose faith, <playername>.  If you do so, Nalzok will grow stronger."
 "Wear the Mitre of Holiness.  It will assist you against the undead."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
 that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
 undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.
 You remember the descriptions of the Temple of Nalzok, given to you by
 The Arch Priest.  It is ahead that you will find Nalzok's trail.

When returning:
 Again, you stand before the Temple of Nalzok.

When first entering the goal level:
 The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
 of tortured souls assault your psyche.
 Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...

When returning:
 Again, you have invaded Nalzok's domain.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "Ah, so The Arch Priest has sent another acolyte to retrieve
 the Mitre of Holiness.
 "No, I see you are no acolyte.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
 after all.  Prepare to die, <currentrank>!  You shall never regain
 the Mitre of Holiness!

Upon further meetings:

 "So, <currentrank>.  Again you challenge me."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "Die now, <currentrank>.  <deity> has no power here to aid you."

When you have the Mitre of Holiness, but Nalzok is still alive:

 "You shall die, <currentrank>, and I will have the Mitre of Holiness back."

====Discouragement====

Nalzok will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "Submit to my will, Priest, and I shall spare you."
 "Your puny powers are no match for me, Priest."
 "I shall have you turned into a zombie for my pleasure!"
 "Despair now, <currentrank>.  <deity> cannot help you."
 "I shall feast upon your soul for many days, Priest."
 "Your death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!"
 "You cannot defeat Nalzok, you fool.  I shall kill you now."
 "Your precious Arch Priest will be my next victim."
 "I feel your powers failing you, <currentrank>.  You shall die now."
 "With the Mitre of Holiness, nothing can stand in my way."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Mitre of Holiness, you feel the essence of
 <deity> fill your soul.  You know now why Nalzok stole it from
 the Great Temple, for with it, a Priest of <deity> could
 easily defeat his plans.
 You sense a message from <deity>.  Though not verbal, you
 get the impression that you must return to The Arch Priest as soon
 as possible.

When killing the nemesis:
 You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as Nalzok's body dissolves
 into a cloud of noxious gas.
 Suddenly, a voice booms out:
     Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, <currentrank>.
     Know now that Moloch is aware of thy presence.
     As for thee, Nalzok, I shall deal with thy failure
     at my leisure.
 You then hear the voice of Nalzok, screaming in terror...

When returning to your quest leader:
 "You have returned, <playername>.  And with the Mitre of Holiness, I see.
 Congratulations.
 "I have been in meditation, and have received direction from
 a minion of <deity>.  <deity> commands that you retain
 the Mitre of Holiness.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
 of Yendor.
 "Go forth, and let <deity> guide your steps."

When subsequently throwing the Mitre of Holiness to the Arch Priest:
 The Arch Priest reiterates that the Mitre of Holiness is yours now.
 "The time has come to resume your search for the Amulet.
 The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the magic portal
 that brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to the Arch Priest after the quest:
 "Welcome back, <playername>.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"

When talking to the Arch Priest after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "You have prevailed, <playername>!  <deity> is surely with you.  Now,
 you must take the amulet, and sacrifice it on <deity>'s altar on
 the Astral plane.  I suspect that I shall never see you again in this
 life, but I hope to at <deity>'s feet."

==Strategy==
Most of the undead created on this quest generate asleep in graveyards, making [[stealth]] a good property to have so you can fight them one by one and at your own pace. [[Drain resistance]] is also recommended due to the sheer number of wraiths and [[Vampire (monster class)|vampires]] that appear in the graveyards: you can protect yourself by wielding an artifact that confers drain resistance (i.e. [[Excalibur]], [[Stormbringer]], or [[the Staff of Aesculapius]]); you can also obtain drain resistance from [[polymorph control|controlled]] [[polyself]], either by becoming a monster with drain resistance or gaining [[lycanthropy]] and using polymorph control or [[unchanging]] to suppress the transformation.

If full protection against [[level drain]] attacks is not obtainable or else proves impractical (e.g., you may be holding off on artifacts in order to make later [[wish]]es), then you can minimize the effects by obtaining [[MC]]3 and/or carrying a means to restore lost levels, most ideally a blessed [[potion of restore ability]] or two; a blessed [[potion of full healing]] can also restore a lost level, but at the cost of decreasing your maximum level by one. An uncommon solution is to eat a [[tripe ration]], which provides a single experience point; level drain leaves you one point away from regaining your previous level, making tripe viable as a solution for the occasional lost level.

===Locate level===
An effective way to clear the undead outside the Temple in the locate level is to use use the #[[Turn undead|turn]] extended command - of course, one should be aware of live monsters sprinkled amongst the undead, and ideally should be tanky enough in case they take multiple turns worth of hits while incapacitated. In addition, do not underestimate the hostile priest of Moloch - if you have no [[magic resistance]], dispose of them before they have a chance to cast their [[Monster spell#Clerical spells|clerical spells]], and beware if they generate with a [[cloak of magic resistance]]. If your only source of magic resistance is worn armor, be careful around foocubi that can remove that armor. The stairs can also be used to your advantage to funnel the hordes of undead and other monsters through - be careful not to get surrounded too far from the upstairs.

===Wraith farming===
The presence of wraiths as the second quest monster and as a frequent sight in graveyards makes this quest branch a highly-tempting place to farm for experience levels - as every level is a graveyard level, however, you will have to lure them out of the branch in some manner; this usually takes the form of having the wraith(s) [[follow]] you up each up staircase, eventually guiding them towards and into the portal between the Quest and the main dungeon. Once a wraith is lured to the main dungeon, they can be killed for the best chance of a corpse drop - remember that when attempting to eat wraiths, there is a {{frac|7}} chance of a "rotten food" message occurring and causing the corpse to rot away immediately.

As above, stealth and either drain resistance or MC3 is recommended if you take this approach; a priest's starting [[robe]] provides MC2, and can either be replaced with a [[cloak of protection]] or supplemented with a [[ring of protection]] to obtain MC3. A source of [[speed]] will also allow the player to keep a safe distance most of the time. With a solid supply of nutrition (such as the various rations that can found in containers within graveyards) and optionally a [[ring of slow digestion]], a patient player can easily reach level 30 this way. While slower and less reliable, you can also repeatedly cast the {{spell of|create monster}} near the portal - there is a 14% chance of a wraith being generated this way.

Some players farming through either method choose to target vampires or zombies for a blessed [[scroll of genocide]] in order to increase the amount of wraiths generated randomly and in the Quest's graveyards.

==Variants==
In the [[Biodiversity patch]], there are many different start levels, each corresponding to a pantheon. For example, if you worship caveman gods, you will get a ziggurat.

&&%s&& %s Healing {144846 2022-03-07T03:37:34Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''Healing''' is the recovery of lost [[hit points]] and is vital to your survival in ''[[NetHack]].

== Healing yourself ==
You [[Hit points#Hit point regeneration|heal naturally]] over time at a rate which increases with your [[constitution]] and [[experience level]]. Wearing a [[ring of regeneration]] causes you to heal 1 HP per turn in addition to your natural healing, but also increases your nutrition loss by 50%. Being polymorphed into certain monsters (notably all {{mcsl|V}}, {{mcsl|L}}, {{mcsl|T}}, and [[werecreature]]s) also gives you regeneration, as does wielding the Staff of Aesculapius, the Healer [[quest artifact]]; it also has another healing effect, detailed below.

There are many possible ways to heal yourself, listed here in rough order of most to least common. Some may have other effects besides just healing, and many can increase your maximum HP if you are close to it—see the specific articles for more details.

{|class="prettytable"
!Healing Method
!Notes
|-
|[[potion of healing]]
|Restores 6d4 HP if uncursed, 8d4 if blessed, or 4d4 if cursed.
|-
|[[potion of extra healing]]
|Restores 6d8 HP if uncursed, 8d8 if blessed, or 4d8 if cursed.
|-
|[[potion of full healing]]
|Restores up to 400 HP regardless of BUC status.
|-
|[[healing spells]]
|The spells of healing and extra healing have the same effects as the uncursed potions, except that they cannot cure certain problems that the potions can, and spells will never increase your maximum HP. Cast at {{kbd|.}} to heal yourself.
|-
|[[prayer]]
|Having less than 6 HP, or less than or equal to 1/7 of your max HP, is considered a major problem. A successful prayer will return your HP to maximum.
|-
|invoking [[The Staff of Aesculapius]]
|This heals half the HP you would need to return to full health. The usual artifact invocation timeout applies, so doing this too often is unwise.
|-
|eating a [[nurse]] corpse or a tin of nurse meat
|Fully restores your HP (unlike the potion of full healing, there is no limit; you can restore several million HP this way if your maximum is high enough). Note that even a blessed tin will take 2 turns to open and eat, and also that eating nurse meat is considered [[cannibalism]] for human characters. Cannibalism is probably preferable to dying, but using nurse meat as a human in a non-emergency situation is definitely not a good idea.
|-
|eating a noncursed [[lump of royal jelly]]
|Restores d20 HP, among other effects. This is rarely enough to be very important, but it does come in handy if you get hungry on the [[Astral Plane]], as you can heal yourself while eating.
|-
|levelling up
|When your [[experience level]] increases by any means, you gain hitpoints equal to your gain in maximum HP. This could potentially give you enough HP to survive another hit, if you saved that [[potion of gain level]] until the last minute.
|-
|being lifesaved
|If you die and are revived by an [[amulet of life saving]], your hitpoints are restored to their maximum.
|-
|consorting with a [[foocubus]]
|May occasionally make you "feel restored to health", raising your HP to their maximum.
|-
|being hit by a [[nurse]]
|If you are wearing no armor and wielding no weapon, being hit by a nurse heals you. This is usually rather impractical in combat, but can be used to your advantage by [[nurse dancing]].
|-
|sitting on a [[throne]]
|One possible effect (1/13 chance) is that you have your HP restored to their maximum, and increases the maximum slightly if close to or at it.{{refsrc|src/sit.c|180|version=NetHack 3.4.3}} This is usually a bad idea if you are low on HP, as another possible effect is an electric shock that deals a fair amount of damage.
|-
|[[potion of unholy water]]
|For chaotics, restores 2d6 hitpoints.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|471|version=NetHack 3.4.3}} Note that the same is not true of holy water (it has beneficial effects to non-chaotics, but doesn't restore any health), and that quaffing unholy water while lawful causes you to lose 2d6 hitpoints. (Neutrals get neither damage nor beneficial effects.)
|-
|zapping yourself with wands
|If you happen to be [[polyself]]ed into an iron golem, a wand of fire restores 12d6 HP; if polyselfed into a flesh golem, a wand of lightning restores 2d6 HP.{{refsrc|src/polyself.c|1276|version=NetHack 3.4.3}} The usual item destruction will still occur.
|}

== Healing pets ==
Your pets regenerate slowly by themselves at a rate of one point per 20 turns, but if they have taken a lot of damage you'll probably want to help them heal up. Here are several ways to do that:
* Cast a spell of {{Spell of|healing}} or {{Spell of|extra healing}} at them. 
* Wield a [[potion of healing]], extra healing, full healing, [[Potion of restore ability|restore ability]], or [[potion of gain ability|gain ability]], and hit your pet with it (you'll need to use the 'fight' command—push F and then the direction of the monster). This will increase its hitpoints to its maximum at the cost of tameness (it's not smart enough to know that you hit it to heal it). You can also throw the potion, which will not decrease tameness, but this has a chance of missing and wasting the potion, whereas the potion is still unharmed if you miss while striking in melee.
* Some intelligent pets may be able to cast the monster spell '[[cure self]]' on themselves, but you cannot influence this happening.
* Intelligent pets will pick up and wear amulets of life saving if they are not already wearing an amulet, which have the same effect as they would on a player.

''Caution'': whacking a pet with potions counts as [[Abuse (pet)|abuse]] in addition to the loss of [[tameness]]. If you commit abuse three times, your pet is guaranteed to become un-tame when life-saved, revived, or unstoned.

== SLASH'EM ==
SLASH'EM adds several other ways to heal yourself and others:

* [[healing hands]] ([[Knight]] [[technique]]) - If not sick or slimed, your HP is increased by 4 * TechLvl
* [[surgery]] ([[Healer]] technique) - If not sick or slimed or if you are not carrying a [[scalpel]], HP is increased by 5-9 + TechLvl, plus an additional 1d2 * TechLvl if you have a medical kit.
* [[wand of healing]] - Heals 5d6 HP
* [[wand of extra healing]] - Heals 6d8 HP

&&%s&& %s Matter {17856 2007-01-11T00:56:59Z {515 MadDawg2552} Redirecting to [[Matter spells]] #REDIRECT [[Matter spells]]}
&&%s&& %s Orc (starting race) {150133 2023-03-07T15:19:13Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Starting equipment */ adjust wording {{for|other uses|Orc}}

The '''orc''', {{white|o}}, is a playable race in ''[[NetHack]]''. (You will see yourself as [[@|{{white|@}}]], unless you have [[showrace]] turned on.) According to the guidebook:
{{guidebook|Orcs are a cruel and barbaric race that hate every living thing (including other orcs). Above all others, Orcs hate Elves with a passion unequalled, and will go out of their way to kill one at any opportunity. The armor and weapons fashioned by the Orcs are typically of inferior quality.}}

Orcs are always [[chaotic]]. They can be [[Barbarian]]s, [[Rogue]]s, [[Ranger]]s or [[Wizard]]s. 

==Racial benefits and restrictions==
Orcs have [[intrinsic]] [[infravision]] and [[poison resistance]]. Like [[Caveman|Cavemen]], they suffer no penalty for [[cannibalism]], eating [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, and can easily eat [[tripe ration]]s without becoming [[nausea|nauseous]]. As an orc, other early-game [[orc (monster class)|orcish]] monster are likely to be peaceful.

From an [[attribute]] perspective, they are somewhat terrible; at their maximum they can have moderately high strength, average dexterity and constitution, but suffer in all other aspects—intelligence, wisdom and charisma. Each of their maximum attributes is lower than or equal to the corresponding maximum of every other race except elves. The following table outlines their maximum (unaided) attribute levels:

{| class="prettytable"
!| Character<br>[[race]]
!| Strength
!| Dexterity
!| Constitution
!| Intelligence
!| Wisdom
!| Charisma
|-
|| [[Orc]]   || 18/50 || 18 || 18 || 16 || 16 || 16
|}

==Starting equipment==
All weapons or armor are replaced with orcish equivalents where possible, meaning that the starting equipment of an orc is inferior to that of other starting races; however, orcish characters that are not Wizards start with two stacks of 1-2 random [[food]] items as a means of compensating for equipment quality.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|852|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=Extra food for orcs}} [[Lembas wafer]]s or [[cram ration]]s in both the initial inventory and the random food items are replaced with [[tripe ration]]s.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|222|version=NetHack 3.6.7|comment=The code for orcish food substitutions was properly implemented in NetHack 3.6.2.}} [[Orcish arrow]]s shot from an [[orcish bow]] receive a +1 multishot bonus as well.

==Strategy==
For orcs, poison resistance not only means being able to eat poisonous corpses such as [[kobold]]s or [[giant spider]]s early in the game, but also less chance that you will suffer early-game instadeaths to certain traps or poisoned projectiles. The corpses of poisonous monsters and tripe rations provide more early sources of nutrition, though tripe cannot be used as a source of [[confusion]] later on.

In addition to being yet another available nutrition source, peaceful goblins and orcs that you meet early on can be used for same-race [[sacrifice]] to automatically convert cross-aligned [[altar]]s and summon peaceful [[demon lords]]; subsequent orc sacrifices will summon peaceful [[foocubi]], giving orcs an easy way to power up in the mid-to-late game.

== Variants ==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], orcs have several more options for roles. An orc can play as a [[Barbarian]], [[Flame Mage]], [[Ice Mage]], [[Necromancer]], [[Ranger]], [[Rogue]], [[Undead Slayer]], or [[Wizard]]. Beyond that, they are largely the same as Vanilla, good physical fighters, low mental stats and charisma, start with [[poison resistance]], can commmit [[cannibalism]] without penalty, and start with inferior equipment. Unlike most races, do not gain any race-based [[technique]]s.

===dNetHack===

Orcs are substantially buffed, especially attribute-wise. They get increased constitution, dexterity, and strength on levelling up, which can exceed the racial maximum.  Their basic max strength is changed to 18 flat to compensate. They get 1 added to each of their scores every three levels, for a total of +7 at level 21 (and all levels beyond).  This bonus is lost upon level drain. In addition to being able to commit cannibalism, orcs gain an alignment bonus for eating orc corpses. ("You feel evil and fiendish!")

{| class="prettytable"

|-
|| Level 1, maximum stats   || 18 || 18 || 18 || 16 || 16 || 16
|}

Orcs also get intrinsic [[magic resistance]] at level 15. The message for this is "You feel magic resistant!" on level-up, "You feel magic-sensitive!" on level drain.

Orcs get 2 extra point of [[armor class|AC]] on level-up, for a total of -10 naked AC. This is calculated by the formula <code>(2*level)/3</code>, so a level 30 orc would get &minus;20 AC from their natural armor, in addition to &minus;7 AC at 25 dex, for a total of &minus;17 naked AC. 

Lastly, orcs get a <code>level+2/3</code> to-hit and damage bonus and a <code>(level/3)*10</code> bonus to carry cap. Along with [[gnome (starting race)|gnomes]], they get double the radius of [[Low Light Vision|low-light vision]].

The two-way magic portal back to the Dungeons of Doom is one of the two marked points in the top left. The Chief Yeoman Warder is in the small 2x2 room in the lower-right part of the building, and eleven other Yeoman Warders are located throughout the level. There is a vault on the left side of the building, meant to represent the former Royal Mint in the Tower. There are five large boxes in the southern part of the map. The two B's in the upper-left corner are ravens; other monsters are large dogs, wolves, werewolves, sewer rats, and rabid rats, all of which are shown. The leftmost chamber on the island to the lower-left represents the Lion Tower, where the Royal Menagerie was once kept. In game terms, it is indeed a [[treasure zoo]]. The stairs down are located at the marked point, at which the eleventh Yeoman Warder is located. The southern entrance to the tower is a drawbridge, guarded by two Yeoman Warders. The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls.

''It should be noted that unlike other quest levels, "the inner ward" is completely non-capitalized in the source code; this article does the same.''

The stairs are located at the marked positions. Monsters here are composed of three peaceful watch captains (@), four peaceful watchmen (W), and seven peaceful prisoners (P). Notably, one of the prisoners (the one marked '!') is William Penn, who would later found the colony of Pennsylvania. There is an axe in the left center courtyard; several bows, each with one silver arrow, in the four-by-four room at the top; and a watchman corpse, representing Talbot Edwards, at the marked '%' symbol. The marked graveyard represents the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula, where executed prisoners were buried, the two marked shops represent storehouses, and the marked bookshop ('boo') represents Wakefield Tower, where records of the kingdom were kept since 1360. The X mark in the lower left room indicates a burnt engraving reading, "In case of trouble, ring bell." The entire level is no-teleport and undiggable.

Also known as the White Tower. Another pre-defined filler level, it contains three large dogs, one wolf, two werewolves, three sewer rats, and two rabid rats; eight random objects; four arrow traps, and two squeaky boards, all randomly placed. There is also a barracks, in the marked area. The stairs are at the indicated positions. The level is undiggable, but teleportation is permitted.

[[Colonel Blood]], with the [[Crown of Saint Edward]] and the [[Bell of Opening]], is in the throne room, along with six random comestibles. Next to each of the sinks is a peaceful sleeping [[knight]] (the Knights of the Bath), as well as a [[broadsword]] (left) and a [[long sword]] (right). The lower-right room is a lawful [[temple]], containing four lit [[tallow candle]]s (two of which are stuck in the walls), as well as a [[chain mail]] and a [[plate mail]] (on the [[altar]].) In addition, there are three [[large dog]]s, one [[wolf]], two [[werewolf (animal)|werewolves]], three [[sewer rat]]s, and two [[rabid rat]]s; four [[arrow trap]]s, and two [[squeaky board]]s, all placed randomly. The stairs leading back up are located at the marked position.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 The forbidding fortress that lay before you is a landmark of
 one of the greatest cities in the world: London.  For nearly six
 centuries, the Tower has kept a solemn watch over the city.
 Yet something is wrong today.  The streets are abandoned and
 overrun with vermin.  Ravens fly ominously overhead.  It is
 your duty to seek out the Chief Yeoman Warder and offer him any
 assistance you can provide.

Next time:
 You are once again in London.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 You have once more returned to London.  This may be your last
 chance to redeem your honour.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Halt!  Who goes there?"
 "An escort for the Keys!"
 "Whose Keys does thou bring?"
 "God preserve Queen Elizabeth!"
 "A Beefeater is more than a bottle of spirits!"

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Halt!  Who goes there?"
 "An escort for the Keys!"
 "Whose Keys does thou bring?"
 "God preserve Queen Elizabeth!"
 "A Beefeater is more than a bottle of spirits!"

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 The Chief Yeoman Warder turns to you with a troubled expression
 on his face.
 "The Tower is in danger.  We are in need of loyal and gallant
 subjects who can serve His Majesty.  Are you prepared for what
 lies ahead?"

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "I see you have returned, <playername>.  Are you now ready to fulfill
 your duty to His Majesty?"

This message is not currently used:

 "Time is growing short, <playername>.  Are you finally prepared to
 serve His Majesty?"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "<playername>, you disgrace the good name of His Majesty.  I must now
 seek another to serve in your place.  Leave London in shame, and
 never return!"

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Alas, <playername>, you are but a <currentrank>.  Such a Yeoman could not
 succeed in bringing justice against Colonel Blood.  Continue your
 adventures and revisit me when you have attained the rank
 of Master Steward."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "Woe, dear <playername>.  You have not yet proven your devotion
 to His Majesty.  Go forth in his service and return when you have
 proven yourself lawful."

When finally assigned the quest:

 "I see that you are a worthy Yeoman, <playername>.
 Perhaps you can aide us in our predicament..."
 "It was but a few moments ago that the Assistant Keeper
 of the Crown Jewels, Talbot Edwards, was found dead.
 It must have been a robbery, since the Crown Jewels are
 missing, including the Crown of Saint Edward.  They are
 normally kept in Martin Tower, safe inside the inner ward."
 "The Crown Jewels are the most sacred symbols of
 His Majesty.  It was a great loss when Cromwell and his
 band of thugs desecrated the monarchy by selling the
 Jewels during the Commonwealth period.  Fortunately, many
 were reconstructed for the coronation of Charles II.  We
 must never let such vandalism happen again!"
 "We suspect that the culprit is no other than Colonel Blood.
 He surely is deceitful enough to pull such a heist.  Do
 you remember how he fought on both sides during the
 Civil War against Parliament?  His plot to seize Dublin
 Castle?  Or his attempt to kidnap the Lord High Steward?
 There is quite a ransom already on that rogue's head!"
 "I have barely enough men to watch the outer ward, and I am
 unable to call for more, since it appears that our warning
 bell has also been stolen.  Would you help me by searching
 the inner ward?  Please bring back the Crown of Saint Edward
 and our warning bell when you find the Jewels."
 "Thank you, and Godspeed!"

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "We must find the Crown of Saint Edward soon!"
 "Please bring back our bell, too!"
 "Go forth and do justice!"
 "Go forth and stop the growth of iniquity!"
 "Go forth and protect the holy church of His Majesty!"
 "Go forth to help and defend widows and orphans!"
 "Go forth and restore the things that are gone to decay!"
 "Go forth and maintain the things that are restored!"
 "Go forth to punish and reform what is amiss!"
 "Go forth and confirm what is in good order!"

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:

 You stand in reverence as you catch a glimpse of the
 courtyard before you.  This is the inner ward of the
 Tower of London, for centuries the home of kings and queens.
 But since the overthrow of Charles I during the Civil War
 and the subsequent return of Charles II, the fortress is
 now mostly used as a treasury, museum, and political prison.
 The Crown Jewels must be here.  But where?

When returning:

 Once again, you are in the inner ward.  You know that the
 Crown Jewels are here -- somewhere.

When first entering the goal level:

 This must be the Sword Room, home of the famous Knights of
 the Bath.  Two of the honoured knights are soaking in the
 tubs before you.  One of them turns to you to whisper
 something:
 "There is a stranger in the banquet hall.  And he has
 the Crown of Saint Edward!"

When returning:

 You are certain that the Crown of Saint Edward is here.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "Greetings, friend.  Were you looking for the Crown of Saint Edward?
 I think I saw it in Bowyer Tower.  Now begone."
 "What, you are still here?  Then I will make with you as I
 did with Talbot Edwards!"

Upon further meetings:

 Colonel Blood points at you and shouts: "Stop, thief!"
 But the tower inhabitants are not fooled by his diversion.

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "You must have been sent by the Chief Yeoman Warder to recover the Crown of Saint Edward.
 I have no choice but to kill you."

When you have the Crown of Saint Edward, but Colonel Blood is still alive:

 "How did you get the Crown of Saint Edward?  It's mine, I say, mine!"

====Discouragement====

Colonel Blood will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "I shall sell the Crown of Saint Edward for a handsome profit!"
 "Don't bother looking for the Crown of Saint Edward.  It isn't here."
 "Stop hitting me.  Can't you see that I am just a poor priest?"
 "You'll never catch me alive!"
 "I saw someone with the Crown of Saint Edward over there."
 "Did you see what I did to Talbot Edwards?"
 "My accomplices have already escaped."
 "I do not fear silly Yeoman (sic)."
 "I am wanted dead or alive."
 "There is a reward on my head, but you will not live to receive it."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you hold the Crown of Saint Edward, you can see why it is more than
 a mere artifact.  Perhaps you should return it to the Chief Yeoman Warder.

When killing the nemesis:

 As Colonel Blood collapses to the floor, he issues a final retort.
 "I cannot believe that I have been apprehended by a mere
 <currentrank>.  Go back to that cowardly Chief Yeoman Warder
 and gloat of your victory."

When returning to your quest leader:

 "You have found the Crown of Saint Edward!  The monarchy is
 once again secure."
 "Behold, <playername>, I have one more duty for you to fulfill:
 finding the Amulet of Yendor, and sacrificing it in the name of
 His Majesty.  This is not an easy task, but until then I can
 permit you to keep the Crown of Saint Edward.  You may find
 its powers useful."
 "Take our bell with you.  When blessed, it can open the
 drawbridges of the Tower.  You may find other uses for it,
 as well."
 "God preserve His Majesty!"

When subsequently throwing the Crown of Saint Edward to the Chief Yeoman Warder:

 The Chief Yeoman Warder handles the Crown of Saint Edward reverently for a moment,   then looks at you.
 "You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
 for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the
 magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to the Chief Yeoman Warder after the quest:

 "Greetings, <playername>.  How is your quest for the Amulet of Yendor?"

When talking to the Chief Yeoman Warder after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:

 "How admirable, <playername>!  You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor!"
 "With the Amulet, His Majesty will build an empire more mighty than
 the world will ever see.  Go quickly, return to the dungeon, and
 climb upward until you meet the elemental planes.  Find the Astral
 Plane, and sacrifice the Amulet on the high altar to His Majesty."
 "Now, would you please return our bell and the Crown of Saint Edward?"

&&%s&& %s Wizard Patch {130750 2020-01-14T03:54:08Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  The '''Wizard Patch''' was a patch against [[NetHack 3.2.0]] through [[NetHack 3.2.3]]. The stated intent was to make [[wizard]]s more like wizards and not just a particularly weak fighter-type class.

==Highlights==
The main features of the Wizard Patch were:

* The wizard's starting [[weapon]] was changed from an [[athame]] to a [[quarterstaff]].

* Spells were made subject to skill level, much as weapons were.

* Different classes could gain skill with different kinds of spells.

* Spells were remembered for a limited duration, and could be cast an unlimited number of times within that period, subject to [[magical energy]].  Previously, spells worked rather like wands, being castable a limited number of times.

* [[Cone of cold]] and [[fireball]] became explosions when cast at Skilled or better.

* {{spell of|Jumping}} and {{Spell of|protection}} spells were added.

The Wizard Patch did ''not'' add restrictions due to shields or metal armor; those were already present starting with [[NetHack 3.2.0]].

==Legacy==
The Wizard Patch was entirely merged into mainline NetHack starting with [[NetHack 3.3.0]].  [[SLASH]] accepted it at an earlier date, and the name added the "EM" designation for Extended Magic, giving the modern name [[SLASH'EM]].  SLASH as such is no longer under development.

==External Links==
[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/988e37c17880f9cf/e63c0ac6ab5c07be Announcement of Wizard Patch 0.7].  The links in that post no longer work.

[http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/Wizard/wiz10.txt Wizard Patch version 1.0] at [[Ali Harlow]]'s website, the last released version of the Wizard Patch. This is a patch against [[NetHack 3.2.2]] and ''will not work'' with NetHack 3.3.0 or later (which already incorporates the Wizard Patch anyway).

The two-way magic [[portal]] back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point at the far right. [[Shaman Karnov]] is next to the co-aligned [[altar]], which also has its [[aligned priest|attendant priest]] (the right-hand end of that cavern being considered a [[temple]]); a [[chest]] is next to him. There are also seven [[neanderthal]]s in the same large cavern, and one in its entrance passageway. There are a total of twelve [[bugbear]]s distributed fairly evenly in four chambers of the right-hand side of the level. In addition to the two marked [[pit]]s in the central passage, there are four other random [[trap]]s on the level. The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls and floor. There are several tight diagonal squeezes to be braved.

===Upper filler level===
This is a cavern level, with five bugbears, a hill giant, a random h, seven random objects, and four random traps.

The upstair is located randomly within the hexagon. The Chromatic Dragon, with the [[Bell of Opening]] and the [[Sceptre of Might]], is at the point marked 'D'. There are three [[shrieker]]s on the level, and fourteen random objects. The walls of the Chamber are undiggable; teleportation is permitted.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You descend through a barely familiar stairwell that you remember
 Shaman Karnov showing you when you embarked upon your vision quest.
 You arrive back at the Caves of the Ancestors, but something seems
 wrong here.  The usual smoke and glowing light of the fires of the
 outer caves are absent, and an uneasy quiet fills the damp air.

Next time:
 Once again, you arrive back at the Caves of the Ancestors.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 For some reason, you think that this may be the last time you will
 enter the Caves of the Ancestors.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "We have not been able to gather as much food since the Giants sealed
 off our access to the outer world."
 "Since the Chromatic Dragon sent her minions, we have been constantly fighting."
 "I have heard your vision quest was successful.  Is this so?"
 "So, tell me, <playername>, how have you fared?"
 "Shaman Karnov grows old.  We know not who will guide us after he ascends."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "The rains have returned and the land grows lush again."
 "Peace has returned, give thanks to <Anu|Ishtar>!"
 "Welcome back!  Did you find the Sceptre of Might?"
 "So, <playername>, tell us the story of your fight with the Chromatic Dragon."
 "Shaman Karnov grows old.  Perhaps you will guide us after he ascends."

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 "You have returned from your vision quest, <playername>.  Thank <Anu|Ishtar>.
 "We are in dire need of your help, my <son|daughter>.
 "But first, I must see if you are yet capable of the quest I would
 ask you to undertake."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Again, you return to us, <playername>.  Let me see if you are ready now."

This message is not currently used:

 "Ah, <playername>.  Are you finally ready?"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "<playername>!  You have sealed our fate.  You seem unable to reform yourself,
 so I must select another to take your place.
 "Begone from the Caves of the Ancestors!  You have betrayed us by choosing
 the path of the chaotic over the true path of the lawful.
 "You no longer live in our eyes."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Alas, <playername>, you are as yet too inexperienced to embark upon such
 a difficult quest as that I propose to give you.
 "A <currentrank> could not possibly survive the rigors demanded to find
 the Dragon's Lair, never mind to confront the Chromatic Dragon herself.
 "Adventure some more, and you will learn the skills you will require.
 <Anu|Ishtar> decrees it."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "<playername>!  You have deviated from my teachings.  You no longer follow
 the path of the <lawful|neutral> as you should.  I banish you from these caves, to
 go forth and purify yourself.  Then, you might be able to accomplish this
 quest."

When finally assigned the quest:
 "You are indeed ready now, <playername>.  I shall tell you a tale of
 great suffering among your people:
 "Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by
 the creatures sent against us by the Chromatic Dragon.
 "She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
 have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
 minions of the Chromatic Dragon managed to steal the Sceptre of Might.
 They took it to the Dragon's Lair and there, none of our
 neanderthal warriors have been able to go.
 "You must find the Dragon's Lair, and within it wrest
 the Sceptre of Might from the Chromatic Dragon.  She guards it as
 jealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
 we can make our caves safe once more.
 "Please, <playername>, recover the Sceptre of Might for us, and return it here."
