Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:

He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand

Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
hospitality, and magic.
As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
use as his spies.
As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
would treat him, not knowing who he was.
Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
exchange for a draught of knowledge).

The Egyptian god of the moon and wisdom, Thoth is the patron
deity of scribes and of knowledge, including scientific,
medical and mathematical writing, and is said to have given
mankind the art of hieroglyphic writing.  He is important as
a mediator and counsellor amongst the gods and is the scribe
of the Heliopolis Ennead pantheon.  According to mythology,
he was born from the head of the god Seth.  He may be
depicted in human form with the head of an ibis, wholly as an
ibis, or as a seated baboon sometimes with its torso covered
in feathers.  His attributes include a crown which consists
of a crescent moon surmounted by a moon disc.
Thoth is generally regarded as a benign deity.  He is also
scrupulously fair and is responsible not only for entering
in the record the souls who pass to afterlife, but of
adjudicating in the Hall of the Two Truths.  The Pyramid
Texts reveal a violent side of his nature by which he

The '''Hpmon''' or '''HPmon''' patch adds a color display to your [[HP]] meter. This patch is only for [[tty]] users.

As you fight monsters, if your HP meter turns yellow, then turns red, then becomes highlighted or blinking, then you know that you are approaching [[Death (character)|death]] and requiring [[healing]] or [[rest]]. This patch makes no change to gameplay but can save your life!

HPmon is also popular because [[nethack.alt.org]] had it (NAO switched on 2012-05-19 to [[statuscolors]]). (The version there sometimes fails to color the HP meter; this might be a bug after resolving the conflict with the [[dumplog]] patch.) [[GruntHack]] has an expanded version of it.

Compare with the [[statuscolors]] patch, which extends HPmon to color several parts of the status line but requires user configuration.

[[Status_hilites]] can also color the HitPoints in 3.6.

&&%s&& %s Unwinnable {149998 2023-02-18T10:53:13Z {4000299 Willful} /* SLASH'EM */ link While any given game of ''[[NetHack]]'' may be very difficult to complete, it is generally understood that every game is winnable — that is, no game is created that the player cannot win.

However, there are a few methods to render a game '''unwinnable''', most of which are related to the [[Quest]]. This may happen by accident, but can also occur through very deliberate action on the player's part. These are the ways in which a game can become unwinnable:

# Before getting permission from the quest leader or proceeding down afterward, [[Altar#Danger in sacrificing|converting your alignment]] at an [[altar]] (exception: you are [[Helm of opposite alignment|non-neutral]] and the quest portal is still present)
# Before permission, the quest leader dies or [[levelport]]s down
# Before permission, getting expelled by angering the quest leader or failing the [[alignment record|alignment]] test seven times (exception: [[The Eye of the Aethiopica|neutral non-wizard]])
# With the [[Amulet of Yendor]] remaining in the quest dungeon branch, getting expelled (exception: leader still alive; must be a wizard, neutral, or able to convert to neutral)
# On the [[Astral Plane]], after [[offer]]ing the Amulet of Yendor to your god but before ascending, saving the game via [[hangup]]

The exceptions are what can be overcome using the [[Eye of the Aethiopica]] and/or a [[helm of opposite alignment]].

These actions make it impossible to obtain the [[Bell of Opening]] from the [[quest nemesis]], or to get the [[Amulet of Yendor]] back out of the quest branch, or to perform the Invocation. All of these are necessary to [[win]].

The best a player can do in an unwinnable situation is to [[escaping the dungeon|escape the dungeon]] with the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]], the Book of the Dead and any other sources of bragging rights.

==Converting your alignment==
If the player unsuccessfully performs an altar conversion by sacrificing at a [[cross-aligned]] altar with negative [[alignment record]], he or she is converted to the [[alignment]] of the altar. That means permission to proceed down cannot be obtained from the quest leader at all. A player's alignment cannot be converted back to any previously held alignment by means of an altar, and the [[quest leader]] will "see through" a helm of opposite alignment.

You cannot go down or [[level teleport]] from the quest home level, even with prior permission, if you are not of your original alignment. This ''can'' be overcome with a helm of opposite alignment.

Note that simply putting on a helm of opposite alignment does '''not''' render the game unwinnable -- removing the helm (after [[curse removal|uncursing]], if necessary) restores the character's previous alignment. You cannot put on the helm in the quest branch. The message you get if you try, "You narrowly avoid losing all chance at your goal", is somewhat misleading.

==Getting expelled==
A second case is if the quest portal has been removed because you have angered the quest leader, or have failed their [[alignment record]] test seven times. Don't throw the [[Bell_of_Opening|silver bell]] or the [[Amulet of Yendor]] at them!

In this case, you will not be able to enter the quest branch at all by normal means. If you do [[branchport]] in, you will have to [[spellbook of charm monster|pacify]] your quest leader before you can get permission to go down. 

If you threw the [[Amulet of Yendor]] at the quest leader, it is trapped in the quest branch. Once the [[portal]] is gone, the only way to get it out is to get expelled again while carrying it. The quest leader still has to be alive for this to work.

Entering the quest at all requires the player is [[neutral]], is not a [[wizard]], and has previously entered the quest branch: the player can [[wish]] for the [[Eye of the Aethiopica]] to branchport to the quest. (You have to have visited the quest once already because the Eye will not open a portal to a branch you haven't been to, and it will only drop you as deep as you have already gone before.)

==Dead quest leader==
{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You can gain access to the Quest by killing your Quest Leader. Doing so gives +7 to god [[anger]] and -20 to [[Luck]], and causes your Luck to time out to -4. You also forfeit the alignment record bonus from killing your Quest Nemesis.}}

If the [[quest leader]] is killed or [[level teleport]]s before you get permission to go down, the game will also be unwinnable. (Monsters will read scrolls of teleportation when they are low on hit points.) Luckily, the leader is generated meditating, and a peaceful one will only be attacked by pets under conflict, so a levelporting leader is extremely rare. Due to a bug, a [[petrified]] quest leader brought back with [[stone to flesh]] or one that has been [[revive]]d will not grant permission. Additionally, only the actual monster can grant or deny permission; a [[doppelganger]] imitating them through some means (e.g. using stone to flesh on a statue of a quest guardian or leader) does not count.

The same restrictions apply to expulsion from the quest, in case you are trying to leave it with the Amulet.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], the [[Candelabrum]] would become permanently unusable if you turned it on with fuel for exactly one more turn and you are not on the vibrating square. This is [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-424|Bug C343-424]], and it was fixed in August 2011.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
SLASH'EM does not actually add any new ways to make the game unwinnable, although it certainly adds ways to make it nearly so. For example, although one needs two of the three alignment keys to reach [[Vlad the Impaler]], lacking them, it is possible to wake him up with a mind flayer's psychic blast, or to summon spheres via the [[flame sphere]] or [[freezing sphere]] spells enough times such that one of them is created next to Vlad, explodes at him and thereby wakes him up.  He will then teleport to meet the player, and be carrying with him the Candelabrum.  Also, locking vital items behind the doors and destroying the keys doesn't make the game unwinnable either.  One can retrieve the Amulet or any Invocation item by luring an appropriate [[covetous]] monster into the third level of Vlad's Tower, and the monster will then retrieve the items for the player.

===Sporkhack===
If the quest leader dies, the stairs are automatically unlocked, to avoid issues with unwinnable games.

===dNetHack===
One of the artifacts, [[DNetHack Artifacts#The Silver Key|The Silver Key]], can be used to perform the Invocation instead of the [[Bell of Opening]]. This lets the game become winnable even if blocked from the quest.

The '''air elemental''' is by far the fastest of elementals and, indeed, the [[speed|fastest]] monster of any sort in the entire game.

Unlike other elementals, air elementals can [[engulf]] players. Their main attack is to pummel the player with debris; this can be quite deadly to unprepared characters due to their extreme speed and because, unlike against other [[whirly]] monsters, one cannot acquire a resistance against the physical damage. Air elementals are not [[genocide|genocidable]].  They are also immune to [[petrification]] and [[poison]]. They cannot deal much damage to players polymorphed into a [[huge]] monster, e.g. a [[titan]].

===Generation===

They appear both on the [[Plane of Air]] (guaranteed) and in the main dungeon (random). On the [[Plane of Air]], they have a lot more hit points.

===Strategy===

====Polymorph====
They make surprisingly bad fighter forms to [[polymorph]] into, though they are good for travel. E.g. hunting the [[vibrating square]], or crossing the [[Plane of Air]]. They are less good for the [[Plane of Fire]] because a [[boulder]]-throwing, [[lava]]-splashing giant might rehumanize you right over [[lava]], and outright bad for the [[Plane of Water]] where you cannot see the [[portal]] move. Once [[polymorph]]ed, you cannot use your [[hand]]s, including to put on or remove rings or operate a bag. Since they are blind, you might want to pack a [[wand of probing]] to make picked-up items seen, or wear the [[Eyes of the Overworld]] (if you have them).

====Combat====
If you are [[engulf]]ed by an air elemental, you can escape by either [[teleport]]ing yourself out if the level allows [[teleport]], or zapping in any direction with a [[wand of teleportation]] if you are on a [[non-teleport level]] (such as the [[Plane of Air]]).
Casting [[slow monster]] or zapping in any direction with a [[wand of slow monster]] will "disrupt" the air elemental and you will be immediately expelled. It is also susceptible to a wand or spell of [[sleep]], allowing plenty of time to give it your own pummeling.

===History===

In previous versions of NetHack, the air elemental's pummel attack dealt twice as much damage as currently; this was changed in [[NetHack 3.4.0|version 3.4.0]].

Ogres can use long range projectile attacks. A melee character may wish to stay in close quarters where the ogre can only use its melee attacks. However, trading projectiles is also a valid strategy, since the ogre will often throw them back rather than approach you.

[[Ogresmasher]] inflicts double damage and has a 1d5 to-hit bonus against ogres, ogre lords and ogre kings.

Ogres are the predominant foe on the [[Barbarian quest]], in the form of standard ogres, and random {{white|O}}s.

{{encyclopedia|<poem>
Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
meal.

The '''stone golem''' is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is one of the stronger types of [[golem]].

==Generation==
Four stone golems are placed just outside of [[Medusa]]'s room on the second variant of [[Medusa's Island|her island]] at level creation, and four more appear on the [[Plane of Earth]] at level creation.

Stone golems are always generated with 60 hit points.{{refsrc|makemon.c|918}}{{refsrc|makemon.c|1534}} In addition to random generation, stone golems are created if you [[polypile]] a square full of enough [[mineral]] items; this also occurs sometimes if there are enough [[platinum]] objects in a pile.

[[Stoning]] any other type of golem, e.g. being hit with a [[cockatrice]] [[egg]] or attacking a live footrice (typically via [[conflict]] or [[polself]]), turns them into a stone golem.{{refsrc|dothrow.c|763}}{{refsrc|mthrowu.c|414}}{{refsrc|uhitm.c|2193}}

When a stone golem is killed, it leaves an inanimate [[statue]] of itself behind as its "[[death drop]]", and its inventory becomes the contents of the statue (which is usually empty){{refsrc|mon.c|259}}{{refsrc|mkobj.c|929|comment=mkcorpstat() calls mksobj_at() which may add spellbooks to the statue. But then mkcorpstat() calls save_mtraits() which will override the contents of the statue and transfer previous killed monster's inventory to the statue.}} Casting stone to flesh on a statue of a stone golem will create a single [[meatball]], as the golem is not a [[fleshy]] monster.

==Strategy==
Stone golems are have a fairly powerful attack and slightly more AC than most golems, but they move half as fast as an unburdened player and lack most resistances outside of the [[sleep resistance|sleep]] and [[poison resistance]] shared with other golems. Casting [[stone to flesh]] on a "live" stone golem will turn it into a [[flesh golem]], which is somewhat faster, more resistant and can hit twice for more damage&mdash;a flesh golem also has weaker AC and base HP, and players meeting stone golems through normal generation are well-equipped to handle their fleshy counterparts. This can also be used to try and gain certain [[intrinsic]]s once you kill the resulting flesh golem.

Of note is that, including [[#Generation|the above]], performing these actions while [[you]] are [[polymorph]]ed into an appropriate golem will turn you into a stone golem:
* Snatching a [[wield]]ed footrice [[corpse]] from a monster with a [[bullwhip]] and catching it.{{refsrc|apply.c|2312}}
* [[Kick]]ing a footrice corpse.{{refsrc|dokick.c|439}}
* Throwing a footrice corpse upward, which causes it to fall back down onto your head.{{refsrc|dothrow.c|811}}
* Eating the meat or egg of a footrice, or eating the meat of [[Medusa]].{{refsrc|eat.c|466}}{{refsrc|eat.c|1717}}
* Hearing a footrice's hiss<!--with the same {{frac|3}} chance?--> after it lands a touch attack on you, or meeting the gaze of Medusa without [[reflection]].{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1194}}{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1940}}
* Touching a footrice corpse with your bare hands.{{refsrc|pickup.c|1310}}{{refsrc|pickup.c|1824}}{{refsrc|pickup.c|1947}}
* Attempting to saddle a live footrice.{{refsrc|steed.c|86}}
* Trying to untrap a live footrice, or falling through a hole or trap door while wielding a footrice corpse.{{refsrc|trap.c|2169}}{{refsrc|trap.c|3344}}

Breaking the statues of stone golems for loot after killing them is usually not worth it, as they are [[mindless]] and do not pick up items&mdash;finding any items in a stone golem's possession is usually an indicator that it was created via polymorph. Randomly-generated statues of stone golem in the dungeon [[Statue#Statue contents|may still contain]] one [[spellbook]].

==History==
The stone golem first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], stone golems are vulnerable to rays from a [[wand of digging]], which halves their HP.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], sixteen statues of stone golems are placed around the locate level of the [[Archeologist quest]]; one of the special levels in [[Gehennom]] included from the [[Heck² patch]] generates three stone golems and five [[clay golem]]s. A fifth stone golem is added to the [[Plane of Earth]] on level creation, and another is generated on the [[Plane of Fire]] on level creation.

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, a stone golem is generated asleep in one variant of [[Mines' End]], and two stone golems appear in the [[throne room]] closets on [[Ruggo the Gnome King]]'s [[Special level (SlashTHEM)|special level]]. SlashTHEM also uses the same special level from the [[Heck² patch]] as dNetHack.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other menial work.
"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the `free sidereal strength of the universe.'
"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy. It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in the Old Synagogue." ...

A '''clay golem''', {{monsym|clay golem}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is one of the stronger [[golem]]s encountered in the dungeon, but is slightly weaker than the [[stone golem]].

A clay golem that is subjected to [[cancellation]], e.g. from the [[wand of cancellation]] or a [[gremlin]] attacking it, will be instantly destroyed - this includes [[you]] if you are [[polymorph]]ed into a clay golem, and you are reverted back to your base form even if you have the [[unchanging]] property.

==Generation==
In addition to random generation, clay golems can generate as a result of [[polypiling]] if there are enough objects made of [[copper]], [[silver]], [[platinum]], [[gemstone]], or [[mineral]] in a given pile of items.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|1306|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Clay golems are always generated with 50 [[hit point]]s.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1985|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Clay golems hit decently hard, but are very slow like many golems and not too difficult to defeat if you can maintain your distance.

==History==
The clay golem first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Golem}}
{{wikipedia|Creation of life from clay}}
The ''gōlem'', originating from Jewish folklore, is an animate, anthropomorphic being usually created entirely from clay (or mud). One of the oldest Talmudic stories describes Adam as a golem, initially created when his mud (or "dust") was "kneaded into a shapeless husk" - similar tales and motifs of the creation of the first man and/or humankind from clay exist in several world religions and mythologies.

The most famous golem narrative, "The Golem of Prague", is generally believed to be a product of early 19th-century German literature: in the late 16th century, the rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel reportedly created a golem from clay gathered at the banks of the Vltava River, and brought it to life through rituals and Hebrew incantations to defend the Prague ghetto from anti-Semitic attacks and pogroms. Golems in these and various other tales are inscribed with Hebrew words that animate them; one particular example is the word ''emét'' (אמת, "truth" in Hebrew), which could be used to deactivate the golem by removing the ''aleph'' (א) from the word, changing the inscription to ''mét'' (מת, "dead") - cancellation has this same effect on the clay golems of ''NetHack'', destroying them instantly.

Clay golems appear in the early monster manuals of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. In the 1st Edition, a clay golem can be created by a lawful good cleric of 17th or higher level through the use of several spells on a man-shaped clay statue; lower-level clerics additionally required a magical tome to do so. The clay golem is under the command of that cleric while animated - these golems were only vulnerable to blunt magical weapons and very specific (usually earth-based) spells. However, similar to some of the classic golem tales that inspired it, there is a 1% cumulative chance each round that the golem is imbued by a chaotic evil spirit, causing it to attack any and every living thing until it is destroyed. 

==Messages==
{{message|Some writing vanishes from the clay golem's head!|A clay golem was hit with a cancellation spell, wand beam or attack - this instantly destroys it.}}
{{message|Some writing vanishes from your head!|You were polymorphed into a clay golem and hit with one of the above effects. This will return you to your original form, even with unchanging.}}
{{message|You have a strangely sad feeling for a moment, then it passes.|Your [[pet]] clay golem was canceled and destroyed by a gremlin.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], clay golems are always generated with 150 HP.{{refsrc|makemon.c|2252|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the [[Chaos Temple Quest|Chaos Temple variant]] of the [[Chaos Quest (dNethack)|Chaos Quest]] generates six clay golems within the exterior of the Temple of Chaos found in the 'past'.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
It was a warm spring night when a fist knocked at the door so
hard that the hinges bent.
A man opened it and peered out into the street. There was
mist coming off the river and it was a cloudy night. He might
as well have tried to see through white velvet.
But he thought afterwards that there had been shapes out
there, just beyond the light spilling out into the road. A
lot of shapes, watching him carefully. He thought maybe
there'd been very faint points of light...
There was no mistaking the shape right in front of him,
though. It was big and dark red and looked like a child's
clay model of a man. Its eyes were two embers.

A '''wood golem''', {{monsym|wood golem}}, is a type of [[golem]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Wood golems take an extra d4 of damage when attacked with an [[axe]] or [[battle-axe]], and can also be damaged by [[erosion|rot- or burn-inducing]] attacks.

A wood golem that is hit by a rotting attack (i.e., from a [[brown pudding]]) will suffer an [[instadeath]] and "fall to pieces". A player [[polymorph]]ed into a wood golem that is rotted away by an attack will instead 'revert to their base form, even if wearing an [[amulet of unchanging]]. A wood golem that is subjected to [[stoning]] will become a [[stone golem]].

==Generation==
In addition to random generation, polypiling enough items made of [[wood]] may create a wood golem.

Wood golems are always generated with 50 hit points and [[corpseless|do not leave a corpse]], instead dropping a pile of 2-8 [[quarterstaves]] [[death drop|upon death]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|990|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1891|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mon.c|400|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Despite a decently strong claw attack for the point at which they can generate, wood golems are quite slow and unlikely to be a threat to most players who encounter them. Be careful not to create a wood golem by accident when polypiling your highlly-enchanted [[Elven item|elven weapon]]s.

==History==
Wood golems first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

Pouring water fast and steady.
Once again he hastens!
How the water spills,
How the water basins
Brimming full he fills!
|[ The Sorcerer's Apprentice, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
 translation by Edwin Zeydel ]
