Acid paraelementals can be dangerous without acid resistance, but aren't quite as damaging as ice paraelementals. They're quite slow as well. However, both their passive attack and their touch attack can corrode your weapon and armor if it's not fixed. Just like the other paraelementals, their damage is only halved by acid resistance.

Acid paraelementals can be sung into being by yellow half-dragon bards.

'''Mortai''' are extremely powerful [[elemental]]s that appear in [[dNetHack]].

==Generation==
Mortai are usually found on the [[Astral Plane]], but may also be generated as [[minion]]s sent to defend neutral altars.

==Strategy==
They will only take 1/16 damage from weapon attacks, so they're best avoided if possible. [[Conflict]] can be useful.

'''SliceHack''' is a [[variant]] of [[SpliceHack]] created by msearle5. Although it has added many new features, it has never been formally announced, and was unknown to the larger community until it was discovered by [[User:Agulp|AntiGulp]], the SpliceHack developer. Much of the SliceHack code has since been merged into SpliceHack, and some isolated features have been merged into [[xNetHack]] and [[EvilHack]] as well.

SliceHack is not currently available for play on any servers, but the code is available for building at https://github.com/msearle5/slicehack.

It is one of the random variants of the Chaos Quest.  As is typically the case for dNetHack's alignment quests, it is divided into roughly three parts (though in this case there is a town on top).

== Areas ==

=== Branch Level ===

The level of the main dungeon containing the portal to the Mithardir Quest will have the following layout:

<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="ttymap">
^=[[Magic portal|{{purple|^}}]]

</replacecharsblock></div>

The above map will be superimposed on a random [[Mines]]-style level.  A random [[maze]] may also be present.

=== Elshava ===

[[Elshava]] is a cluster of random shops surrounded by water.  The shopkeepers sell a variety of useful gear, including items that can't be found anywhere else in the game.  All types of shop can also be paid to ID '''tiles''' and '''slabs''' recovered from Mithardir.

The portal to the next level is somewhere in the shallow water outside the town.  You can use any portal detection method to find it (including wandering around the shallows until you stumble through it) or you can pay one of the shopkeepers to reveal it.

=== Mithardir Wastes ===

The [[Mithardir Wastes]] are a series of three levels consisting of white dust and random rock formations.  Dust storms are frequent, producing blinding clouds.  The largest of these clouds may inflict deadly [[Illness|illness]], so they should be avoided. A small amount of tiles can be found scattered randomly across the level (but no slabs).

These levels are connected by portals.  You can use any portal detection method to find the next portal, and the portals will also be revealed if you get within 2 squares of them.  The last of these levels has a round tower in the center, which contains the downstairs. The tower does not have a door, and must be dug or teleported into.

=== Last Spire ===

The [[Last Spire]] is a series of three fixed-layout levels.  The mid-boss of the branch, the [[First Wraithworm]], is found on the second level along with the Second Key of Chaos. The first '''slab''' is found on the third level.

These levels are connected by a mixture of portals and staircases, typically found behind hidden doors (though the portal in the First Wraithworm's room is positioned randomly).

=== Mithardir Catacombs ===

The [[Mithardir Catacombs]] is a set of three random-layout levels.  The boss of the branch, the [[Aspect of The Silence]], is found on the lowest level, along with the second and third '''slabs'''. Tiles can be found in closets around the level, along with on Alabaster mummies.

Alabaster mummies can be found on these levels, tied to a specific syllable of power. The syllable is randomly determined but will modify the mummy's attack routine in accordance with the syllable chosen. The syllable will drop on death.

== Treasure ==

A variety of unique treasure can be recovered from this branch:

*'''Living Armor''': The shops in Elshava may sell [[living armor]]/[[giant sea anemone]] and/or [[barnacle armor]]/[[giant shell armor]].  These armors automatically attack nearby enemies when worn.
*'''Living Masks''': The shops in Elshava may sell these, which take up your face slot and grant magical breathing while worn.
*'''Ceramic Tiles''': These are found throughout the quest.  Each tile bears one of six magic [[syllable]]s.  Each type of syllable grants a temporary bonus and (lesser) permanent bonus when read.
*'''Slabs''': These are the "artifacts" of the quest.  The first is found after the mid-boss, and the second and third are found on the last level of the quest.  Each slab bears a different [[Word of Creation]] (the order that the Words are generated in is random).  When read, each Word grants a passive bonus and an activated power.

== Origin ==

Mithardir is from Dungeons and Dragons.  The upper parts of the quest (Elshava through the Last Spire) are based on the adventure "The Ruins of Pelon" from ''Dead Gods'', by Monte Cook.  The lower part of the level is (very) loosely based on the ruins of Shom, from 4th edition D&D.

&&%s&& %s Word of Creation {145245 2022-03-29T00:23:25Z {4000354 Chris} /* The First Word of Creation/Blinding Glyph */ 
The Words of Creation are the "artifacts" of the [[Mithardir Quest]]. They are found on "metallic slabs" at various points in the quest, and must be read before they can be used. When read, each slab grants a passive bonus and an activated power.  Unlike the [[syllable]]s, the  slabs do not need to be identified before their Words can be read.

All activated powers have no range limit other than line-of-sight.  All activated powers are quick to use: up to one may be used for free each move.  Note that this is the '''same''' one-use-free resource that '''[[stethoscope]]s''' and '''syllables''' both use, so you may need to carefully chose which to spend your free action on!

== The First Word of Creation/Blinding Glyph ==

'''Passive bonus''': Intrinsic [[flying]].

'''Activated power''': The First Word is an AoE effect centered on you that illuminates the area around you, dealing damage to monsters caught in the light. The base damage is (lvl/2)d3 damage, but the die size is incremented by 3 if the monster fulfills certain restrictions. They are: 
* is [[undead]]
* is a [[demon]]
* is [[primordials (dnethack)|primordial]]
* has a [[life drain]]ing or vampiric attack
* has a [[disintegration]] or [[archon]] fire attack
* belongs to the shade, wraith, or unknown abomination classes

Each category stacks, so you can deal pretty good damage against targets that meet 2 or 3 of those criteria. [[Aspect of The Silence|Aspects of The Silence]] in particular take (lvl/2)d18 damage (they are not undead, but they're demonic primordial aberrations that possess a vampiric attack and a disintegration attack).

== The Dividing Word of Creation/Cerulean Glyph ==

'''Passive bonus''': Intrinsic water-proofing.

'''Activated power''': The Dividing Word fires a beam in a chosen direction that will remove water (leaving a pit, or just floor for shallow water) and damage monsters caught in the beam. The base damage is (lvl/2)d3, and this will also throw monsters to the side. There's a 5% chance of just bisecting a monster though (instantly killing it). This is often not terribly useful, but it can be used by ranged characters to create space/delay oncoming enemies and there's often no downside to using it early in a fight on the off chance the bisection effect triggers.

== The Nurturing Word of Creation/Verdant Glyph ==

'''Passive bonus''': Intrinsic hungerless [[regeneration]] '''for all pets'''.

'''Activated power''': The Nurturing Word creates grass around you, in addition to heavily damaging aspects of the Silence, [[elemental]]s, undead, and manufactured [[golem]]s (clay, flesh, stone). The damage is (lvl/2)d12. If this damage kills the monster, a [[tree]] will be created on its square, and the items it drops will be [[buried]] underneath.

&&%s&& %s Syllable {144114 2022-01-09T06:48:57Z {4001016 NeroOneTrueKing}  Tiles are a class of items in [[dNethack]] which represent the syllables of power.

To read a tile, you must type-identify it first (so it shows the syllable, not the shape of the glyph). Which glyph corresponds to which syllable is randomly assigned each game.

Each has a different temporary effect when read, along with a different permanent effect. If the tile is uncursed, the temporary effects last for 10 turns. If it's blessed, they last for 15 turns. If the tile is cursed, the temporary effects last for 40 turns but the permanent bonus is not confered.

There are 6 syllables: 

== Aesh, the syllable of strength == 

'''Temporary bonus''': +10 damage using weapons for the duration. 

'''Permanent bonus''': +1/3 damage per non-cursed Aesh used. So after the third Aesh, all attacks will deal +1 damage.  If the total number of Aesh tiles read is not divisible by three, there is a remainder-in-three chance of dealing an extra +1 damage on each attack.

== Krau, the syllable of power ==

'''Temporary bonus''': 150% damage on all spells and some spell-like effects from artifacts. 

'''Permanent bonus''': +1/3 damage per non-cursed Krau used. So after the third Krau, all attacks will deal +1 damage.  If the total number of Krau tiles read is not divisible by three, there is a remainder-in-three chance of dealing an extra +1 damage on each spell.

== Hoon, the syllable of life ==

'''Temporary bonus''': +10 hp / turn for the duration. 

'''Permanent bonus''': +1 to natural healing rate for every non-cursed Hoon used.  For comparison, a each level earned ''also'' increases the natural healing rate by 1, so if a 15th-level character reads 15 non-cursed Hoon tiles their healing rate will be approximately doubled.

== Uur, the syllable of grace ==

'''Temporary bonus''': +10 to-hit and -10 AC, along with +6 movement points per turn.

'''Permanent bonus''': +1/2 AC for every non-cursed Uur used (increasing after each ''odd''-numbered tile read). If an even number of non-cursed Uur tiles have been read, the full bonus is applied to the character's base AC, defending them against all attacks.  If an odd number of non-cursed tiles have been read, the final +1 AC is applied to the character's ''armor-based'' AC, which is bypassed by some attacks.

== Naen, the syllable of thought ==

'''Temporary bonus''': +10 pw / turn regenerated, along with 100% spell success rates while active.

'''Permanent bonus''': You gain a permanent energy regeneration bonus, 1 power every 30 turns per non-cursed Naen used.  For comparison, a each level earned ''also'' increases the natural regeneration rate by 1, so if a 15th-level character reads 15 non-cursed Hoon tiles their power regeneration rate will be approximately doubled.

== Vaul, the syllable of spirit ==

'''Temporary bonus''': Half damage (stacks with half physical or spell damage) on all attacks that hit you, as well as displacement. 

'''Permanent bonus''': +1/5 DR per non-cursed Vaul used. You'll get +1 DR to a specific slot per Vaul, rotating between slots evenly. So your first you'll have +1 DR for your head slot, second will apply to your upper torso, third to your arms, fourth to your lower torso, fifth to your legs, before finally rotating back to the head for +2 DR for your head slot on the sixth non-cursed Vaul.

The '''Aspects of The Silence''' are the end-boss of the [[Mithardir Quest]].

==Generation==
Unlike most quest end-bosses, the Aspects are not unique monsters, but can spawn as part of normal monster generation on the final level only. One is also spawned as soon as the character knows 2 [[Words of Creation]] while on the final level. Since the second slab is also located on the final level, this spawn may trigger as soon as the character finishes reading the slab (if they do so on-level) or it may trigger as soon as they re-visit the level after reading the slab elsewhere.

==Passive Powers==
Aspects are permanently invisible, can walk through walls, and can always sense your location. Each Aspect on the level further drains 3 [[energy]] per turn.  Finally, Aspects in close proximity to the character cause greatly elevated [[Spellcasting#Calculating_spell_success_rate|spell failure]].

== Treasure ==

The first Aspect you kill ('''not''' necessarily the first to spawn!) will drop the third (and final) slab. Try to avoid killing it over water or with the Nurturing Word, since that makes the slab harder to access. In addition, the first Aspect to spawn will also cause the [[Alignment_key_(dNethack)|Third Key of Chaos]] to spawn somewhere on the level.

==Strategies==
Aspects are extremely lethal in melee, especially for the unprepared. They drain levels via their vampiric tentacles (bypassing [[magic cancellation]]), inflict deadly [[illness]]es, and [[disintegrate]] first your gear and then you.  In addition, they take only 1/4 damage from physical attacks.  Additionally, they're classified as demons, so they can gate more Aspects of The Silence.

Aspects can be [[ward]]ed off with any ward versus U (elder sign, gorg, hexa?, hepta?). Since they do not recover HP, you can gradually wear them down while safe on your ward.

A sufficiently powerful melee combatant can also defeat them in close combat. It's a good idea to have well-enchanted armor before fighting them, since their disintegrating tentacles will need to disenchant armor pieces before finally disintegrating them.  While it might be tempting to wear junk armor, if all your armor is destroyed the next hit will disintegrate you! It's also borderline required to have some sort of means to cure illnesses. Both of these things can be superseded with a reliable ward, but it's not recommended. Be very wary of their ability to gate in more Aspects if you try this strategy!

Spellcasters can use a Naen [[syllable]] to bypass both the power drain and the elevated spell failure chance.  Since you will likely lose a lot of energy while the Aspect makes its way to you across the level, you may need to use multiple Naen syllables to finish the fight. 

A wand-using character will find their wands to be a reliable means of dealing damage, particularly fire and lightning (they resist cold and death). 

The First Word and the Nurturing Word are [[Words of Creation]] that are both highly effective against Aspects.  You will often have learned one of these before needing to fight an Aspect, and may have learned both. Try not to finish the first Aspect off with the Nurturing Word, since that will mean that you need to dig the slab out of the ground under the resultant tree!

Half-dragons may find the Aspects easiest of all, since their breath weapon may bypass the damage resistances Aspects have.

The '''First Wraithworm''' is the mid-boss of the [[Mithardir Quest]].  Though stationary, it's positioned in the center of a room scaled such that it can reach every square with its bite attack.

In addition to its other properties, 50% of melee attacks will fail to affect the Wraithworm, passing harmlessly through instead.  The First Wraithworm also creates a "windstorm" effect that flings the character around randomly, dealing light damage, forcing them to skip turns, and further frustrating melee combatants.

'''The Iron Spoon of Liberation''' is an [[artifact weapon|artifact]] [[weapon-tool]] in [[dNetHack]]. It is the [[quest artifact]] for [[Convict]]s, and acts as the prize for completing the [[Convict quest]]; it replaces [[The Iron Ball of Liberation]], which is now called [[The Iron Ball of Levitation]] and given to you by your [[quest leader]], [[Robert the Lifer]], upon accepting the quest. It is chaotic for wishing purposes, and its base item is a [[spoon]].

==Effects==
The Iron Spoon of Liberation has a +1d5 to-hit bonus and does double damage to all monsters. When carried, it confers [[automatic searching]], [[free action]], and acts as a [[luckstone]], in addition to providing a bonus to manual [[searching]]; when wielded, it confers [[stealth]]. [[Invoking]] the Iron Spoon allows you to [[phase]] through walls for a limited time, much like The Iron Ball of Liberation. [[Apply]]ing The Iron Spoon of Liberation allows you to [[dig]]; it can also be used to [[engrave]] with the same quality and speed as an [[athame]].

As a spoon, Convicts wielding it can make [[sneak attacks]] similar to a [[Rogue]].

'''Lifestealer''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[SporkHack]] and [[EvilHack]]. Its [[base item]] is a [[two-handed sword]], and it is [[chaotic]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Lifestealer is most often associated with [[Vlad the Impaler]].

As the name implies, Lifestealer will [[drain life]] and levels from monsters it hits and confers [[drain resistance]] when wielded, similar to [[Stormbringer]].

==Generation==
Vlad is guaranteed to be generated with the weapon when encountered at the top of [[Vlad's Tower|his tower]] in [[Gehennom]]; if the item already exists in that game, however (e.g. in [[bones]]), it will be replaced with a regular two-handed sword.

Due to its method of generation, it does not increase the [[artifact]] count for purposes of wishing.

'''Keolewa''' is an [[artifact weapon]] in [[SporkHack]] and [[EvilHack]]. It is [[neutral]] for [[wish]]ing purposes, and its [[base item]] is a [[club]].

==Generation==
Keolewa is the guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Cavemen]].

==Effects==
Keolewa grants a +1d5 bonus to-hit and a +1d6 bonus to damage versus all monsters, and grants [[shock resistance]] when wielded.

==Origin==
''Keolewa'' is a Hawaiian word that appears in a variety of prayers, chants and oral traditions, including once as the name of the morning star.

The artifact as it appears in SporkHack and EvilHack is most likely inspired by the weapon of Paopele, a great warrior that appears in the Legend of Kapunohu. According to tradition, the club Keolewa is so great that "it extends over a whole district in length, reaches up to the clouds of heaven, and takes four thousand men to carry".<ref>[http://www.donch.com/lulhmyths29.htm Hawaiian Mythology]</ref> Keolewa could also hide the sun and hold back the east wind.

This template links to a monster class page while displaying only that class's glyph. For example:

<div style="padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em">The level contains nine random {{mcsl|B}}, five random {{mcsl|Z}}, a random {{mcsl|W}}, a random {{mcsl|V}}, and two random {{mcsl|P}}.</div>

Unlike {{tl|monclasssym}}, this will always display the glyph in white, even for classes which only contain one monster (such as {{mcsl|J}}). This is done so that multiple uses of this template won't contain an out-of-place colored glyph. If you want to link to the monster using its colored glyph, use {{tl|msl}} instead: <code><nowiki>{{msl|jabberwock}}</nowiki></code> produces {{msl|jabberwock}}.

&&%s&& %s Mordor Ruins Quest {137842 2021-02-14T12:51:15Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Forest Edge */ Typo The '''Mordor Ruins Quest''' is one of the [[alignment quest|alignment-based quests]] in [[dNetHack]].  It is one of the random variants of the Chaos Quest. As is typically the case for dNetHack's alignment quests, it is divided into roughly three parts, though in this case the middle section is tricky to categorize.

== Areas ==

=== Branch Level ===

The level of the main dungeon containing the portal to the Mordor Ruins Quest will have the following layout:

<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="dnhttymap">

</replacecharsblock></div>

This level will be initially populated by a number of elves (including an [[elf-lord]]) and orcs (including an [[orc-captain]]).  As elves and orcs attack one another, this will fairly quickly be whittled down to just one type of monster.

Eight random objects can be found on this level.

=== Elven Forest ===

The elven forest is a series of four levels.  Each level is connected to the next by a magic portal.

==== Deep Forest ====

The first two levels will be mines-type forest levels with networks of small elf "houses" amongst the trees.  A river runs top-to-bottom on the right-hand side of the maps.

Each will be initially populated by elves and the occasional [[Coure Eladrin]].  In addition, there will be one [[wraith]] per level, and a 5% chance of a [[Nazgul]] per level.  Since Nazgul are much stronger than the normal monster types, if one spawns you may need to retreat from the branch until you are strong enough to destroy it.

Each of these levels has 1-2 rings (80% chance of 2), an 80% chance of a '''wrathful''' mithril sword, and a 60% chance of a '''wrathful''' silver sword, as well as random items in the elf houses.  Finally, each level has a chest containing a random potion, piece of armor, spellbook, and scroll.

==== River Ford ====

The third forest level is bisected by a river, with a shallow-water crossing in the center of the map:

eeeeee}}}}}}}-----eeeee
</replacecharsblock></div>

The [[ford guardian]] is found on the central island, protecting the altar.  The left-hand side of the map is a forest level like the previous two, initially populated by elves and possibly including a [[Ghaele Eladrin]] (25%), an elf-lord (75%), and an elf-lady (75%).  The right-hand side of the map is an area of diseased forest, initially populated by orcs and random [[wraith]]s and [[shade]]s.

This level contains the same random loot as the previous levels.

==== Forest Edge ====

The left-hand side of this level is a second diseased forest, while the right-hand side is an open grassy plain.

The forest area is initially populated by random wraiths and shades.  In addition, there is a battle between orcs and elves taking place on the right side of the map.  The elves are led by an [[Elvenqueen]] and two [[Firre Eladrin]], while the orcs are led by a Nazgul. It is likely that the two sides will kill each-other off fairly quickly.  The elven side is commonly victorious, however, the presence of the Nazgul causes corpses to rise as more shades which may finish off the elven survivors.

This level contains a +3 ring of protection, a ring of invisibility, a cursed ring of aggravate monster, and up to 3 random rings (20% chance each). In addition to the two standard '''wrathful''' swords, there is a 20% chance of another wrathful mithril sword and a 20% chance of another wrathful silver sword. There is also a large quantity of discarded elven and orcish weapons throughout the level, including a '''morgul''' orcish short sword and dagger (50% chance each).

=== Mordor Ruins ===

==== Mordor Wall ====

The Mordor Wall, known also as Minas Morgul, has the following layout:

<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock rules="dnhttymap">

</replacecharsblock></div>

Minas Morgul provides two ways to enter Mordor. Downstairs into the fortress can be reached near the top of the screen, for those adventures who favor the direct approach. Alternatively, a secret portal to Shelob's lair, the Spider Cave, is located on the left side of the screen. Whichever path an adventurer chooses to take first will be generated with the Second Key of Chaos placed randomly somewhere on the level.

This level includes two Nazgul, a wraith, a Mordor marhsall, six Mordor orc elite, four orc shaman, three orc-captains, and 15 Mordor orcs.

The entry portal for this level will be randomly placed somewhere in the bottom five rows of the map.

==== Mordor Fortress ====

Minas Morgul, the Mordor Fortress, has the following layout:

The throne room on the right side of the map is the court of the ogre emperor, composed of the ogre emperor himself, three ogre mages, a marilith, three ogre kings, 12 ogre lords, eight ogres, five Mordor orcs, and a tengu. The ogre emperor carries the [[DNetHack_artifacts#Mantle_of_Wrath|Mantle of Wrath]], a useful artifact orcish cloak that grants fire resistance, half spell damage, and blocks all sources of aggravate monster while worn. 

The treasure room immediately to the left of orge emperor's throne room includes a range of interesting weapons, such as a +1 flaming long sword, a +4 flaming two-handed sword, and a range of armor. Most of these items may not be useful for an adventurer who is already strong enough to reach this level, but these chests may hold an odd item or two that can replace a weak item or two that you may not have found a replacement for yet. One chest will also have several interesting masks for those players who have a source of polymorph, including a [[Faerinaal]] mask, a [[Gwynharwyf]] mask, and a [[Queen of Stars]] mask.

The throne room on the upper left side of the map contains a Mordor Marshal, a Mordor shaman, ten Mordor orc elite, four hobgoblins, two hill orcs, a manes, a succubus, and a vrock. The treasure room to the right of the throne includes a number of chests containing a range of archaic, crystal, and elvish armor.
