===Droven items ===

====Armor====

Droven [[armor]] (both [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Droven plate mail|droven plate mail]] and [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Items#Droven chain mail|droven chain mail]]) is made of a material that degrades when exposed to light, eventually evaporating completely.  Fixed droven armor still evaporates, but will regenerate while in the dark.  Unfixed droven armor does not regenerate.  '''Cloaks''' with [[magic cancellation]] protect against the light, so a MC3 cloak is a virtual necessity when exploring lit rooms.  It is worth it to try to keep your starting armor intact.  Both armors are non-[[metal]]lic, low weight, and offer high AC.  Droven chain mail also boosts spellcasting. Most drow begin play with one of these types of armor.

All Drow start with a droven cloak made of spiderwebs.  These cloaks offer no AC but give level 3 [[magic cancellation]].  Droven cloaks can be [[Apply|(a)pplied]] to an adjacent square to create a [[web]] there.  Each use of the cloak lowers its magic cancellation by 1.  If it reaches MC0, the cloak is used up. The cloak may also be applied at an existing web to remove the web and restore MC to the cloak.

====Weapons====

Droven [[weapon]]s are high damage, but are made of fragile obsidian, meaning they will shatter if thrown or (in the case of droven crossbow bolts) fired.  All starting droven weapons are coated in sleeping poison.

The lone exception to this is the droven crossbow, which is made of more durable stuff.  Droven crossbows also bear the [[silver]] holy symbol of [[Lolth]], so they deal an additional 1d20 silver damage if used to bash silver-hating creatures.

====Rings====

All drow also begin play with a droven signet ring.  This is a new [[randomized appearance]] for [[ring]]s, so the magical properties of the ring vary from game to game, but all signet rings function as poison-injection rings.  When #dipped into an eligible potion, the ring absorbs 30 doses of poison, which can be inflicted on opponents through barehanded combat while wearing the ring.  If two signet rings are worn, both apply their poison.  The signet rings given to starting drow are pre-loaded with sleeping poison.

Signet rings are guaranteed to be of a valid type for starting players.  All drow can reach grand-master level in [[Bare hands|unarmed fighting]].

Signet rings also bear specific crests, and sometimes the holy symbols of drow deities.  Rings engraved with the holy symbols also count as silver rings when attacking silver-hating monsters. Rings that have a spiderweb design on them add +5 to unarmed attacks.

=== Lolth ===

"Lolth" is a Drow-specific weaker version of [[Elbereth]]. It works against the same monsters (all but @, A, K, minotaurs and riders) with the difference that if the monster is higher level than you, it will drain your alignment, and it won't work if your alignment is 0 or less.

=== Origin ===

dNetHack's drow race is based on SLASH'EM's drow.  The bare-handed sleep attack that the SLASH'EM drow are known for became the poison-injecting signet rings.

The [[Necromancer]] and [[The Palantir of Westernesse]] start on the [[throne]] in the center of the map.

==Trivia==

The original elf quest appears to have been set in the last days of the First Age of the Sun and the Moon (since the Quest Leaders are Earendil and Elwing, who only lived on Earth during that time), and featured a nondescript Goblin King as the nemesis.  This version of the quest is set during the Third Age, roughly concurrent with the Hobbit.  Galadriel and Celeborn are the quest leaders, and the nemesis is Sauron in his guise of the Necromancer.  The Quest changes history, as the Elvish PC recovers Sauron's Palantir, which would prevent him from using it as his Eye, and from corrupting Denethor and making a treaty with Saruman.

The locate level of this quest, the Drider Caves, is reused in the [[Drow Racial Quest]] and the [[Hedrow Racial Quest]] with different up- and down-stair positions; suggesting that Dol Guldur, the Grove of Eilistraee, and Firestorm Peak are all in the same world, and relatively close by one-another.

&&%s&& %s NetHack Fourk {144099 2022-01-05T22:06:12Z {4001414 Nabru} Since ascension.run is rip, the table is now redundant. '''NetHack Fourk''' is a NetHack [[variant]] built on the [[NetHack 4]] codebase, with a more experimental approach to gameplay changes that is still conservative compared to heavily modified variants like [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNetHack]].

==Public server==
NetHack Fourk can be played at [[hardfought.org]].

==Changes==

In addition to the [[NetHack 4]] interface and AI enhancements, Fourk has made a number of gameplay changes.  These fall into four major categories:
* Balance adjustments, intended to improve the overall balance and difficulty curve of the game.  Things like alignment record, to-hit calculations, experience requirements, etc. have had the shape of their curve adjusted, and some game features have been buffed or gently nerfed so that they fit better into the overall scheme of the game's balance, as the variant creator envisions it.  Some of these changes have been more successful and well-received by players than others; some of the less successful ones have been backed out.
* Monster and class reorganization. Some classes with very few monsters have been combined and thus freed up, and some heavily overloaded monster classes have been split. Some monsters have switched from one symbol class to another one where they fit better. Additionally, some monsters that were formerly represented by punctuation marks are now represented by actual letters. For example, leprechauns are now {{green|i}}, and everything that was formerly {{white|:}} is now {{white|l}} (for lizard).
* Differentiation and variety. Some monsters, items, or special levels that were practically identical have been tweaked slightly so that they are no longer quite so closely the same.  Some special levels have entirely new versions as well.
* Consolidation. Some things have been removed on the grounds that they didn't really add that much to the game. (For example, there are fewer types of polearms than in vanilla.)

For a detailed list of changes, see the changelog (under {{sa|External links|sectionsign=1}}, below).

==Skill tables==
Gnomes have increased skill caps for club and crossbow, orcs have increased skill caps for scimitar, and dwarves have increased skill caps for pick-axe.

&&%s&& %s Half-dragon (starting race) {149853 2023-02-04T09:14:39Z {4000763 EasterlyIrk} add updated hlf dragon claws, breath, role Half-dragons are a new playable race in [[dNethack]].

== Properties ==

*Half-dragons may be anachrononauts, archeologists, barbarians, binders, cavepeople, convicts, knights, monks, madmen, nobles, priests, rogues, rangers, samurais, troubadours or wizards. 
*Half-dragons have a draconic breath weapon selected at game start, usable via #ability
**The breath is randomly selected from fire, frost, lightning, poison, acid, sleep. Half-dragon nobles will instead get either cold or magic with equal odds, and half-dragon madman will get a random breath attack ala shimmering dragons if they're female or fire if they're male
**It costs 15 energy to use, does not burn nutrition, and does not suffer from spell failure.
**Base damage is (1+(XL/2))d6 damage, the same as magic missile. This can be upgraded by wearing dragon scale armor that matches your breath weapon, by 50% per matching armor piece worn. For example, a half-dragon with acid breath will get 50% extra damage with their breath while wearing yellow dragon scale mail, or double damage if wearing both mail and a shield.
**You are granted full immunity to your own breath weapon, which permanently grants the appropriate resistance. This does grant permanent intrinsic magic resistance with magical breath, and does not grant anything to male madmen who have a randomly varying breath attack. This also grants full intrinsic immunity, rather than just resistance, for fire, cold and lightning bearing half-dragons, which fully negates primordial elemental attacks compared to the halved damage they normally deal through resistances. Lightning half-dragons are not immune to being blinded "by the flash" caused by being hit with a lightning bolt.
*Half-dragons gain 1 bonus AC per 3 levels.
*Half-dragons are slower than normal (base speed 8 instead of speed 12).
*Half-dragons gain a bonus to bare-handed and martial arts damage from their claws - they have triple dice size, so they'll deal 1d6 damage instead of 1d2, or 1d12 instead of 1d4 with martial arts
*Half-dragons are counted as dragons for [[cannibalism]] and [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing_creatures_of_own_race|same-race sacrifice]] purposes.
*Half-dragons gain intrinsic flying at 14th level. ("You feel wings sprout from your back!")
*Half-dragons will start with a pet "[[Pseudodragon#Tiny_pseudodragon|tiny pseudodragon]]" instead of a dog/cat/pony, and the pseudodragon also shares the relevant breath attack/resistance.  
**Knights spawn with "[[Pseudodragon#Riding_pseudodragon|saddled riding pseudodragon]]", which is 2 steps of growth older and can be ridden.

{{wikipedia|Eladrin}}

'''Eladrin''' are chaotic angels in [[dNetHack]]. Each type has a humanoid form and an energy form. They will shift to the energy form once their HP drops below 50%, and may return to their humanoid forms once their HP goes back above 50%. Eladrin typically don't drop their equipment when changing to their energy form, and will re-equip their weapons and armor automatically as they return to their humanoid forms. Eladrin are typically highly resistant to physical damage. In their humanoid form, they are protected by their armor, in energy form they take {{frac|4}} base weapon damage. All Eladrin but Tulani can appear in throne rooms, with an elvenking/elvenqueen presiding over. Some of the types of Eladrin are generated on the Planes as well.
