{{questmon|Aglaope|Bard|nemesis}}

For her main attack, Aglaope has 5 songs.  Three buff monsters on the current dungeon level, and two of them debuff your pets.

Buffs:
* Encouragement: Increases damage done by hostile monsters by <code>1+level/3</code>, where <code>level</code> is Aglaope's current monster level.
* Good health: Cures paralysis, blindness, laughing, berserking, stun, confusion, or fleeing on all hostile monsters on the current level.
* Haste: Speeds up monsters on the current level by 12 (from normal speed to very fast).

Debuffs:
* Dirge: Decreases damage done by pets by <code>-1-level/3</code>, where <code>level</code> is Aglaope's current monster level.
* Slowness: Slows down pets by 12 speed (from very fast to standard speed)

Each of these songs, in addition to having their affects, cancels your current song and warps you to Aglaope. From there, she uses her theft attack and 4d4 Lyre-stealing claw. It's best to bring a [[magic whistle]] to summon your pets, and an engagement ring to prevent her seduction theft. This warping is not affected by magic resistance, magic cancellation, or teleport control.

Defeating Aglaope can be of variable difficulty. A player without an engagement ring will have to struggle through her constant seduction attacks. On the other hand, a player with a hoard of high-level pets, especially such as dragons, ancient nagas, or master mind flayers, can make extremely short work of her.

'''Nimune''', {{magenta|n}}, is the [[Knight]] [[quest nemesis]] in [[dNetHack]]. She is a [[spellcasting]] [[nymph (monster class)|nymph]] that guards the [[Bell of Opening]] and the Knight's [[quest artifact]], the [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]].

==Strategy==
Nimune moves at the same speed as an unhasted player - she will also teleport all over the map while attempting to seduce and rob you. Further, her spells can cause hallucinations and can summon monsters that can overwhelm an unprepared player.

Knights will either need to be fast enough to kill Nimune quickly or strong enough to deal with summoned monsters while Nimune teleports about the map. Jousting can be particularly effective, and teleporting next to Nimune and immediately jousting can allow a fast player to pick up the Magic Mirror of Merlin quickly before Nimune can (though Nimune will still need to be killed to get the Bell of Opening). Another option is to use area-of-effect spells that can target Nimune (e.g., blizzard or electrical storm) while staying out of direct line-of-sight to avoid her beam spells.

An '''elder brain''', {{magenta|U}}, is a monster that appears in [[dNetHack]]. They are [[sessile]], [[telepathic]] [[aberrations]] that 'rule' over [[mind flayer]] colonies and possess [[intelligence]]-draining tentacle attacks much like them, alongside various [[Monster spellcasting|spellcasting]] abilities.

The elder brain is one of the few monsters, if not the only one, to serve as a non-unique [[quest nemesis]].

==Generation==
An elder brain serves as the quest nemesis for the [[Drow (starting race)|Drow]] [[Noble]], waiting at the center of the [[Drow Noble Quest]]'s goal level. It only guards the [[Bell of Opening]] - the [[quest artifact]], the [[Web of the Chosen]], is within the hands of the now-[[mindless]] [[A'gone]], imprisoned in her cell on the level's edge.

In the [[Anachrononaut quest]], an elder brain is generated in the center of each lower filler level upon level creation; three more are placed around the goal level, serving as "nemeses" for [[Anachrononaut]]s in lieu of a formal quest nemesis. [[Android]]s ([[Clockwork Automaton (starting race)|'clockwork']] Anachrononauts) will encounter an additional elder brain on their home level.

==Strategy==
The elder brain that serves as a quest nemesis will discourage you with various telepathic messages via a special mind blast as you venture deeper into the colony; for each mind blast your [[insight]] is increased, and all telepathic enemies on the level are alerted of your position and given an accuracy & damage boost.
{{clear}}

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Illithid}}
In most works featuring [[illithid]]s (or mind flayers), an "elder brain" is the core of illithid society on a local scale. The elder brain lives in a pool of cerebral fluid in the center of a city, acting as its "ruler"; dead illithids have their brain extracted and taken to the pool - illithids believe themselves to become immortal through incorporating their personality into the Elder Brain this way. In reality, their memories, thoughts and experiences are consumed and added to the collective, while all else is lost; this is a secret that Elder Brains guard closely.

As the Elder Brain contains the essence of every illithid that died in its community, it functions in part as a vast library of knowledge that can be called upon with a simple telepathic call; the Elder Brain in turn can communicate telepathically with anyone in its community, issuing orders and ensuring everyone conforms. An extremely ancient Elder Brain is called a God-Brain because its psionic powers are almost limitless. Psionic potential is thus an integral part of the illithid identity, and the Elder Brain cannot absorb magical powers; illithids who delve too far into wizardry beyond bounds deemed acceptable are often cast out, and such illithids seek [[Alhoon|immortality through undeath]] instead.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	The elder brain is a huge, fibrous mass of cognizant brain 
	tissue covered with writhing feelers. A single elder brain 
	floats within the depths of a briny pool found at the center 
	of its illithid community.
	
	The elder brain is the center of its illithid community, 
	serving as an advisor and, most importantly, the living 
	repository of the community's technology, history, and psionic 
	expertise. It is the right and obligation of every illithid to 
	merge with the elder brain after death � living in exalted 
	mentality while guiding and shepherding its erstwhile 
	community. While most illithids believe that their personality 
	will survive the transition, individual egos are suborned to 
	the gestalt consciousness suffusing the tissue mass.

'''A'gone''', {{magenta|@}}, is a [[unique monster]] that appears in the [[Drow Noble quest]]. She is a [[Drow (monster)|drow]] that "guards" the [[Drow (starting race)|Drow]] [[Noble]]'s [[quest artifact]], the [[Web of the Chosen]].

A'gone was the rival of the Drow Noble player character, selected by [[Lolth]] to be her Chosen priestess; she was originally sent by a rival to your [[quest leader]] and [[mother]] to discover the cause of the sudden silence within a life-cavern colony previously used for food production. A'gone failed and was captured by the [[mind flayer]]s that had taken over - her mind was [[mindless|subsequently destroyed]], and she was imprisoned in a cell near the dwelling of the colony's [[elder brain]].

==Generation==
A'gone is imprisoned within one of the cells on the edge of the Drow Noble quest goal level, with [[iron bars]] blocking off access; the entire level is [[undiggable]].

==Strategy==
As the [[umber hulk]]s around the level cannot dig into the cells, you will need a [[force bolt]] spell or a [[wand of striking]] to break the iron bars of A'gone's cell; this may be best to do after you have taken care of the elder brain guarding the [[Bell of Opening]]. A'gone herself is not only mindless, but completely harmless as well - her sole "attack" in the code is a 0d0 [[grabbing attack]] which cannot be used, and her only defenses are her 60 [[magic resistance (monster)|MR]] and [[sleep resistance]]. As such, if you have dealt with the more pressing threats, there is little else to do beyond quickly putting A'gone out of her misery and retrieving the artifact.

An alhoon is a [[mind flayer]] which managed to become a [[lich]], and shares traits of both monsters - mixing the [[cold]] touch, casting and [[drain life (monster attack)|life drain]] of the lich with the tentacles and [[intelligence]] drain of the mind flayer.

==Encyclopedia Entry==


{{encyclopedia|
	A truly terrifying creature, alhoons are rogue master mind flayers
	that sought out ultimate magical power, sacrificing their souls
	and becoming something akin to an arch-lich.  Alhoons do not have
	as many tentacle attacks as their mind flayer brethren, but they
	can cast powerful spells.  They enjoy all of the strengths and
	weaknesses associated with being undead.
