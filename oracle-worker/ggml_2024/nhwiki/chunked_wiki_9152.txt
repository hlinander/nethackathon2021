You cannot wear a [[shield]] or engage in [[two-weapon combat]] while wielding one. Hitting a monster with a two-handed weapon has a chance to [[Shattering blow|shatter]] its wielded weapon. [[Monster]]s, including [[pet]]s, can wield two-handed weapons if they have the [[strong]] attribute and are not wearing a shield, in addition to the usual restrictions, i.e. they must have a weapon attack, no [[cross-aligned]] [[artifact]]s, etc.

In addition to the weapons listed above, [[polearm]]s are also two-handed, but are designed for [[pound]]ing and thus not as useful when handled as melee weapons.

==Strategy==
Two-handed weapons are infamous for their crippling effect when wielding a [[cursed]] one; wielding a cursed weapon while wearing a cursed shield has similar drawbacks. Spellcasting monsters (including [[Rodney]]) are often the most notorious culprits, as they can [[Curse items|curse your items]] directly; while your hands are welded to a cursed two-hander, you cannot loot or apply containers, cast spells, change your cloak, body armor, or shirt, wear or remove [[ring]]s, and several other activities. These handicaps also make it hard to get at your [[curse removal]] items, since you cannot cast spells and your uncursing items will usually be safely in your [[bag]].

Your [[god]] treats this as a [[major trouble]] for [[prayer]] purposes, making it a viable option provided your weapon was not cursed as a result of [[anger]]ing them. As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], you can empty your bag on the floor with the #[[tip]] command to reach your means of curse removal; it is best to prepare a bag of such items in advance for when prayer is inconvenient or unavailable (e.g. in [[Gehennom]]). Some people also drop {{of|potion|holy water}} on the ground in places you can easily [[branchport]] or [[level teleport]] to.

==Variants==
As the #tip command was introduced in NetHack 3.6.0, variants based on older versions (such as [[SLASH'EM]]) may lack the command; this makes wielding a cursed two-handed weapon a much more serious problem in those games, and players may choose to avoid these weapons entirely.

===SLASH'EM===
In SLASH'EM, [[bow]]s, [[crossbow]]s, and some [[firearm]]s (but not [[sling]]s) are also two-handed.

{{patch
 |name=Telnet Tiles Server
 |author=Justin Hiltscher
 |bilious=123
}}
'''vt_tiledata''' is a community patch for NetHack that adds extra escape codes into the data stream, mainly intended for graphical frontends. The name ''vt_tiledata'' comes from the boolean option used in version 3.4.3 on NAO.

The original patch, called Telnet Tiles, was made by Justin Hiltscher. That patch only sent one type of escape code, the version NAO used for 3.4.3 added some extra codes. This option only works for the [[tty]] window mode.

The Dev Team added this patch to vanilla NetHack for version 3.6.1 with a few changes (see below).

==Escape codes==
All of the escape codes are in the format <tt>ESC [ N z</tt> (3.4.3 patch) or <tt>ESC [ 1 ; N z</tt> (3.6.1), where N can be one or more positive integer values, semicolon-separated. For example, <tt>ESC [ 0 ; 120 z</tt> (3.4.3 patch) or <tt>ESC [ 1 ; 0 ; 120 z</tt> (3.6.1).

3.4.3-NAO uses the following codes:
*'''ESC [ 0 ; ''n'' z''': Start a glyph (aka a tile) number '''n'''.
*'''ESC [ 1 z''': End a glyph.
*'''ESC [ 2 ; ''n'' z''': Select a window '''n''' to output to.
*'''ESC [ 3 z''': End of data. NetHack has finished sending data to you, and is waiting for your input.

3.6.1 uses the following codes: {{refsrc|include/config.h|485|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}
*'''ESC [ 1 ; 0 ; ''n'' ; ''m'' z''': Start a glyph (aka a tile) number n, with flags m
*'''ESC [ 1 ; 1 z''': End a glyph.
*'''ESC [ 1 ; 2 ; ''n'' z''': Select a window n to output to.
*'''ESC [ 1 ; 3 z''': End of data. NetHack has finished sending data, and is waiting for input.

Special flags of a glyph can be: {{refsrc|include/hack.h|76|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

* 0x0001: corpse
* 0x0002: invisible
* 0x0004: detected
* 0x0008: pet
* 0x0010: ridden
* 0x0020: statue
* 0x0040: object pile
* 0x0080: lava hilight

{{ upcoming|Nethack 3.7.0|
* 0x00001: hero
* 0x00002: corpse
* 0x00004: invisible
* 0x00008: detected
* 0x00010: pet
* 0x00020: ridden
* 0x00040: statue
* 0x00080: object pile
* 0x00100: lava hilight
* 0x00200: ice hilight
* 0x00200: sink hilight (same as ice hilight)
* 0x00400: out-of-sight lit areas when [[Options#dark_room|dark_room]] is disabled
* 0x00800: unexplored
* 0x01000: male
* 0x02000: female
* 0x04000: bad coordinates
}}

Whenever NetHack outputs anything, it will first output the select window code.
Whenever NetHack outputs a tile, it will first output the start glyph code, then the escape codes for color and the glyph character itself, and then the end glyph code.

==Support==
Currently the escape codes are supported by [[EbonHack]], [[Soiled]], and [http://webhack.webhook.org/ webhack.webhook.org.]
The 3.4.3-NAO-style escape codes are [https://github.com/chromium/hterm/blob/master/doc/ControlSequences.md#control-sequence-introducer-csi-csi supported] by Chromium's [https://hterm.org/ hterm].
Some terminal emulators do not like unknown escape codes - For example gnome-terminal prints these escape codes on the screen.

&&%s&& %s Template talk:Kbd {62279 2011-01-02T03:15:11Z {214 Dptr1988} Ctrl and shift notations == Template usage ==

Given the variety of different ways to achieve the same input as well as the variety of different ways of representing those methods with this template, wouldn't it be a good idea to provide some more detailed examples of the preferred usage of this template? 

When I made some changes to articles using this template, I initially changed the template usage to what I thought was "the standard", but quickly realized that there were many different ways of using this template and a clear standard had not be set by the articles using this template. Here are some of the usages that I noticed variations on:

*Shift vs. uppercase characters. The examples given on the {{tl|kbd}} page by [[User:Paxed|Paxed]] seem to prefer using {{kbd|shift|x}}, although that's most likely just because he was wanting to demonstrate that the template could handle up to 4 keys at once. I prefer the uppercase character method as for the reasons [[User:Tjr|Tjr]] has mentioned, but mostly just because it's more compact.

*{{kbd|ctrl|x}} vs. {{kbd|^x|link=0}}. I have no comment or preference on this, but just noticed the variations.

*Using this template extended commands. I think that this template should not be used for extended commands, since this template seems to be oriented towards keys instead of commands, but I did see this usage, so it's something to discuss.

*Combining multiple key strokes, such as {{kbd|100s|link=0}}. As long as there is no confusion between a single key name such as {{kbd|ctrl}} and a sequence of key strokes such as {{kbd|c}}{{kbd|t}}{{kbd|r}}{{kbd|l}}, this probably isn't an issue other than in linking, which can be turned off when using the template this way.

I'm not wanting to change the standards or even press other editors into using a certain standard, I'm simply trying to determine a standard that I can use, since I wasn't able to find a clear standard in the articles that use this template. Although if all interested editors can agree on a certain standard for certain usages, I'd be happy to see a note of that in the description of this template of even in the [[NetHackWiki:style guide|style guide]] if editors feel it's important enough.

--[[User:Dptr1988|Dptr1988]] 02:35, 2 January 2011 (UTC)

: I think we should have a standard (if we reach consensus, that is).
: Do newbies really know what ^x means if they have no experience with MS-DOS? --[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 02:49, 2 January 2011 (UTC)

::I think that {{kbd|^x|link=0}} (or {{kbd|^|x}} ?) is more obscure for most readers than the {{kbd|ctrl|x}} notation, but that we could easily clarify it in the {{kbd|^}} page if it was needed, so I don't think that obscurity would be much of an issue in this case. If the {{kbd|^x|link=0}} notation is chosen, the situation of multiple keystrokes grouped in a single template parameter would need to be addressed. Wikipedia has list of notations [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key#Notation] if anybody is interested to see what is commonly used.

::For people that have not had experience with case-sensitivity being an issue, it could be argued that the uppercase notation in shift vs. uppercase could be obscure. And since making a note of the case significance in the page for each character would probably not be as simple as it would be in the case of the {{kbd|^}} character, obscurity would be a bigger concern in the shift vs. uppercase issue.

A '''heavy hammer''' is a melee weapon introduced in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is similar to a [[war hammer]], using the same skill, but does slightly more damage.  It is not randomly generated, but instead serves as a base item for [[Mjollnir]], instead of the weaker war hammer.  Unfortunately, it is not much stronger, and Mjollnir remains a very weak weapon indeed against [[shock resistant]] monsters.  Note that, because heavy hammers are made of the intrinsically [[erodeproof]] material "[[metal]]", a fully identified Mjollnir is not called ''the rustproof +7 Mjollnir'', but merely ''the +7 Mjollnir''.  Don't waste [[scroll of enchant weapon|scrolls of enchant weapon]] trying to rustproof it.

It is possible to wish for a plain heavy hammer, similar to a [[runesword]] or a [[tsurugi]], but there is no reason to do so.

Rapiers are comparable in damage to sabers while being somewhat lighter.

===Generation===
Rapiers are not randomly generated in SLASH'EM. A [[player monster]] [[rogue (player monster)|rogue]] in the halls of [[Grund's Stronghold]] will [[Monster starting inventory|always generate with]] a [[enchantment|+1]] rapier.

Comments in the source code indicate that a rapier was intended to be the [[base item]] for an [[artifact weapon]] named [[Scalpel (artifact)|Scalpel]], which was carried over from [[SLASH 6]].{{refsrc|objects.c|196|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}{{refsrc|artifact.c|1244|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

In dNetHack, rapiers are medium-sized, one-handed piercing weapons. They receive only half the normal strength bonus to damage, but also gain a {{frac|(DEX - 11)|2}} bonus.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Rapier}}
A rapier (/ËˆreÉªpiÉ™r/) is a type of sword with a slender and sharply-pointed double-edged blade; some historical rapier samples feature a [[broadsword]]-like blade mounted on a typical rapier hilt. The term dates back to the mid-16th century, and the sword was popular throughout 16th-and-17th century Western Europe, both for civilian use and as a military side arm. Rapiers are also popularly known as dueling weapons.

This page is an attempt to collect interesting NetHack factoids for possible inclusion on the [[Main Page]], loosely modeled on [[wikipedia:WP:DYK|Wikipedia's "Did you know" setup]].  The idea is to make the main page more interesting and to attract casual visitors to look deeper.  In the process, we might even be able to teach each other some interesting bits of NetHack trivia.

If this page looks a bit unfinished, it's because it is.  Right now, we first need to collect enough interesting "hooks" to have something to put on the Main Page.

== Guidelines ==

* Favor new articles and edits.  On Wikipedia, the DYK sections consists solely of these, but I figure we have plenty of interesting things in our existing articles that we can use to bootstrap the process.
* Each entry should be in the form of a "hook" consisting of a single question (beginning with "Did you know", which is replaced by ellipsis).  Include at least one link to a wiki article in each hook.  The linked articles don't have to be particularly good; this isn't [[NetHackWiki:Featured articles|featured articles]].
* Hooks should be selected and phrased to arouse curiosity in readers.  Avoid blatant spoilers in the hook.  It's better to be a little bit oblique and invite interested readers to look in the article instead. Try not to be ''too'' cryptic, though: readers who already know what the hook is about should be able to recognize it.

== Sources of ideas ==

* [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent changes]] and [[Special:NewPages|new pages]]
* [[Special:Random|Random page]]
* [[Rumors]]
* ...

== Hooks ==

:{{{2}}}|}}</includeonly></onlyinclude>
This template can be used to display lists of NetHack messages with an (optional) explanation. It also generates anchors, so that the messages can be individually linked to from other pages.

== Examples ==

<nowiki>{{message|You feel limber!|The [[petrification]] process has been stopped.}}</nowiki> gives:
{{message|You feel limber!|The [[petrification]] process has been stopped.}}

The message can now be linked to with <nowiki>[[#You feel limber!]]</nowiki>, producing [[#You feel limber!]]

The template encodes any special characters that would otherwise mess up the anchor, so you can (and should) include unescaped special characters into the message.

<nowiki>{{message|You feel that <god> is bummed.|A [[god]] smote you while you were hallucinating.}}</nowiki> gives:
{{message|You feel that <god> is bummed.|A [[god]] smote you while you were [[hallucinating]].}}

You can also have just the message without an explanation, which can be useful if you want to use one explanation for multiple messages:

<pre><nowiki>{{message|Who was that Maud person anyway?}}
{{message|Thinking of Maud you forget everything else.|You read a [[scroll of amnesia]].}}</nowiki></pre>

results in:
{{message|Who was that Maud person anyway?}}
{{message|Thinking of Maud you forget everything else.|You read a [[scroll of amnesia]].}}

Make sure not to have any blank lines between <nowiki>{{message}}</nowiki> invocations so all messages end up inside the same <tt><nowiki><dl></nowiki></tt> element.

Is there a good way to strip the markup from data passed in through template parameter? If this could be done, that would allow editors to format messages as they pleased without affecting the link anchor. But I don't know how to do this or if it can even be done, although I did see an experimental extension that had the same ideas [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Strip_Markup], and even mentioned one of it's intended uses was to generate clean link anchors.

'''Serpent's Tongue''' is the guaranteed first sacrifice gift for [[necromancer]]s in [[SLASH'EM]]. It also exists in [[SpliceHack]], where it is not affiliated with any role.

It does double damage to all monsters, and even more to non-poison-resistant enemies:<ref>{{sourcecode|artifact.c|1206|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}</ref>
* 40% chance of 2 + d6 damage
* 30% chance of 4 + 2d6 damage
* 20% chance of 6 + 3d6 damage
* 10% chance of poison [[instadeath]]

==Comparison with other artifacts==

Despite its being a weak base item type and comparing unfavorably with many other artifacts at +0, a fully-enchanted Serpent's Tongue is among the best weapons in SLASH'EM from an average expected damage perspective. A +7 Serpent's Tongue will, in the best case scenario, do an average of:

* 5 base damage vs. small and 4 base damage vs. large foes
* plus 2 x 7 = 14 from the doubled enchantment
* plus 90% chance of an additional ~10 average damage and 10% chance of instakill vs. non-poison resistant foes
* plus any applicable strength and skill bonuses ([[Rogue]], [[Ranger]], [[Tourist]], [[Valkyrie]], [[Wizard]] can all reach expert in dagger)

This gives it a total damage of 29 vs. small and 28 vs. large non-poison resistant foes with a 10% chance of instakill, plus any applicable strength, skill, and blessed damage bonuses.

Compare this with an average of 31.5 / 30.5 for the [[Bat from Hell]] ([[club]] skill), 32.5 / 34.5 for [[Reaper]] ([[polearm]] skill), and 34.5 / 34.5 for [[Mjollnir]] ([[hammer]] skill), none of which can instakill, and of which Reaper is two-handed and Mjollnir's damage bonus doesn't apply to to shock-resistant foes. For these reasons, Serpent's Tongue is an excellent end-game choice for non-lawfuls either as a primary weapon, or as a secondary weapon for #twoweaponing. Note that [[lawful]]s should avoid Serpent's Tongue as they will receive an [[alignment]] penalty for using poison.

==Miscellaneous==

If you try to [[Upgrading objects|upgrade]] it, nothing happens. Nice try though.

Note that this artifact does ''not'' provide poison-resistance!

'''Base attributes''' can be viewed by pressing {{kbd|ctrl|x}}.

The window shows current and starting [[race]], [[role]], [[gender]] and [[alignment]], and [[god|deities]]. Current deity is marked with '''<tt>(c)</tt>''' and starting deity with '''<tt>(s)</tt>'''.

For example:
<div class="ttyscreen">
