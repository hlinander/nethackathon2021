fast they become tainted; corpses on an ice surface age half as fast,
corpses do not age while in iceboxes, and lizard and lichen corpses
never become tainted (though they do become too old for sacrifice).
Vampires, mummies and zombies leave corpses that are already considered
old.  Tainted corpses do not provide either nutrition or intrinsics.

(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

You can acquire useful intrinsics by eating certain corpses or tins.
The blessed/cursed status does *not* change the likelihood of getting
an intrinsic.  If the monster has more than one conferrable intrinsic,
one is randomly picked, with equal probability among all possible.
The CHANCE that the picked intrinsic is conferred varies among the
different intrinsics; some are based on the level of the monster (LEV).
If you get the intrinsic, you will get a MESSAGE (the second one if
you are hallucinating).
  INTRINSIC          CHANCE  MESSAGE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~
  Fire resistance    LEV/15  "You feel a momentary chill."
                             "You be chillin'."
  Sleep resistance   LEV/15  "You feel wide awake"
  Cold resistance    LEV/15  "You feel full of hot air"
  Disintegration     LEV/15  "You feel very firm."
    resistance               "You feel totally together, man."
  Shock resistance   LEV/15  "Your health currently feels amplified!"
                             "You feel grounded in reality."
  Poison resistance  LEV/15  "You feel healthy."
                             ("You feel especially healthy." if you had
                             previously acquired non-permanent poison
                             resistance by other means.)
                             Note: 25% better chance if killer bee or
                             scorpion.
  Teleport           LEV/10  "You feel very jumpy."
                             "You feel diffuse."
  Teleport control   LEV/12  "You feel in control of yourself."
                             "You feel centered in your personal space."
  Telepathy           100%   "You feel a strange mental acuity."
                             "You feel in touch with the cosmos."
        
Some corpses or tins have additional effects:
  :bjDFNP  If you eat a lizard or any acidic monster, a possible stoning
           process is stopped.
           "You feel limber" (non-hallucinating)
           "What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of art!"
           (hallucinating with charisma <= 15)
           "What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of fine art!"
           (hallucinating with charisma > 15)

  :  Eating a lizard has the supplemental effect of reducing stunning
     or confusion timeouts to 2 turns, if higher.

  :  Eating a newt ("eye of newt") may cause you to gain 1 to 3 energy
     (2/3 chance, always if at two-thirds maximum energy or below). If
     this would take you above your maximum energy, there is a 1/3 chance
     that your maximum energy will be increased by one.
       "You feel a mild buzz."

  :@ Eating a chameleon or doppelganger makes you polymorph once.
     (Eating doppelgangers may also be considered cannibalism if you
     are human.)

  h  a (master) mind flayer has a 50% chance of increasing your INT by
     one. Otherwise, it confers telepathy.

  m  Eating a mimic makes you mimic a pile of gold (or, if hallucinating,
     an orange) for some turns, unless you have unchanging. The larger the
     mimic the longer you imitate. During this time, you are shown as a
     $-sign or %-sign.  If you are attacked, you revert to your previous
     form.

  yB Eating a bat will make you stunned for 30 (more) turns, or 60 (more)
     turns for a giant bat.  In theory, this also holds for yellow lights
     (but they don't leave corpses in recent versions).

  E  When you eat a stalker's corpse and you are not invisible, you'll
     become invisible for 50 to 149 turns. If you're already invisible,
     you become permanently invisible and get the "see invisible"
     intrinsic.  In both cases, you are stunned for 60 (more) turns.

  F@ If the monster has a stun or hallucination attack or is a violet
     fungus, you get hallucination for (another) 200 turns.

  H  Eating a giant, stone giant, hill giant, fire giant, frost giant,
     storm giant, or Lord Surtur will increase your strength.  If you
     had less than 18 strength, then you have a 19/24 chance of gaining
     one point, or a 1/24 chance each of gaining 2 to 6 points.  If you
     had 18 strength or more, then you gain 1 to 10 points (equally
     likely), or just one point if you had strength 18/85 or more, up to
     18/** (or your racial maximum if lower).

  P  Eating a green slime's corpse (unless polymorphed into a green slime,
     a salamander, a flaming sphere, or a fire vortex or elemental; or you
     have unchanging or were being slimed already) will slime you to death
     in 10 turns.

  Q  A quantum mechanic's corpse makes you toggle your speed.  If you
     were not currently fast, you'll get fast; otherwise, you lose the
     speed.

  W  Eating a wraith's corpse lets you gain a level (unless the corpse
     is rotten and rots away completely).

  df If you eat any of little dog, dog, large dog, kitten, housecat, or
     large cat, you'll get the intrinsic "aggravate monster" unless you
     are a Caveman or an orc.  "You feel that eating the <monster> was a
     bad idea."

  c@ If you eat a cockatrice, chickatrice or Medusa's corpse and you
     are neither stoning resistant nor are you polymorphed into a golem,
     you'll be instantly killed by stoning.

  @hGK  Eating something of your own species (Kops are human) is 
        considered cannibalism unless you are a Caveman or an orc.  You
        get the intrinsic "aggravate monster" and lose 2 to 5 luck.

  @  Eating a were-creature makes you a lycanthrope of the same kind and
     may be considered cannibalism if you are human.

  @  Eating a nurse heals you up to max hitpoints and may be considered
     cannibalism if you are human.

  &  Eating Death, Pestilence or Famine is instantly fatal.


Tins
~~~~
(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

You get up to 50 moves to open a tin; otherwise, you give up. If you are
wielding a tin opener, it takes one turn; any dagger or crysknife, 3
turns; or a pick-axe or axe, 6 turns. Failing this, if you have greasy
fingers the tin will be dropped (if carried), otherwise it will take
10+d(500/(DEX+STR)) turns to open (18/xx strengths being mapped to the
range 19-21).  Blessed tins "open like magic" in one turn.  Cursed tins
have a 1/8 chance of exploding and will always contain rotten food, so
they won't give any nutrition but will make you even more hungry. 

Tins made by you with a tinning kit are always homemade if not cursed. 
All other tins are one of these fifteen possibilities: pureed (500),
deep fried (60), homemade (50), pickled (40), soup (20), stir fried (80),
candied (100), boiled (50), dried (55), szechuan (70), french fried (40),
sauteed (95), broiled (80), smoked (50), or rotten (-50).  The number in
the parentheses is the nutrition value of each.  You cannot tell in
advance what type a given tin is.

When you eat deep fried or french fried food, you get slippery fingers
for up to 15 rounds, making you drop your wielded weapon.  You can shorten
the time by (a)pplying a towel.  Don't forget to pick your weapon up again.

You can obtain intrinsics from eating tins, with the same chance that
you would have from eating the monster's corpse.  Note that the chance
of getting an intrinsic does not change if the tin is blessed or
cursed.

One of the most useful tins is the tin of spinach. If the tin is cursed,
you lose strength equivalent to eating a giant corpse.  Otherwise,
eating the spinach "makes you feel like Popeye" (or Swee'pea while
hallucinating) and gives you more strength equivalent to a giant corpse.
Tins of spinach have a nutrition of 600.


Other food
~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

Eating a spring of wolfsbane cures lycanthropy.

A carrot cures blindness.  Ever seen a rabbit with glasses? (It won't
help with being creamed or envenomed, though.)

Eating a fortune cookie gives you a rumor. You can also just (r)ead it
without eating the cookie. The rumour is from the true file if the
cookie is blessed, the false file if cursed, or either if uncursed.

Eating a lump of royal jelly increases (decreases if cursed) your
strength by one. If the jelly was cursed, you lose up to 20 hit points,
otherwise you gain up to 20 HP and your wounded legs heal. If your
actual HP would become higher than your maximum HP, there is a 1/17
chance of increasing your maximum HP by one.

Eating a cockatrice egg is a real bad idea if you're not polymorphed
into something that resists stoning.  However, they are very useful when
thrown at monsters.

Eating green slime is also an extremely bad idea unless you're polymorphed
into something fiery or a slime yourself (or have unchanging).

Eating a eucalyptus leaf cures sickness or vomiting. They can also be
a)pplied to give the effect of a tin whistle (cursed or uncursed) or a
magic whistle (blessed; this has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf).

Eating tripe may make you vomit (50% chance) unless you are a Caveman
or an orc, or polymorphed into a carnivorous non-humanoid.

In addition to eating them, cream pies may be thrown to blind their target,
or you can a)pply one directly to blind yourself.


Eating objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

There are some conditions before you can eat an object. If you are
polymorphed into a metallivore (rock mole, rust monster, or xorn), you
may eat objects made of metal.

If you are polymorphed into a gelatinous cube, the object is organic,
and the object doesn't contain other objects, you may eat it.  This is
different for real gelatinous cubes, which can eat a container and hold
the non-organic contents of that container engulfed.  So when such a
beasty eats your chest with all the artifacts, you may find them on its
corpse.

You can never eat Unique Items such as the Amulet or the invocation
artifacts.

Eating something that isn't actually food always takes only one move.
The code addresses this issue by stating, "[We don't want] to deal with
partly eaten plate mails, players who polymorph back to human in the
middle of their metallic meal, etc...."

Eating rings has a 1/3 chance of conferring the intrinsic of the ring.
Eating amulets has a 1/5 chance of having an effect.  Not all intrinsics
can be acquired this way.  See the spoilers "amul-343.txt" and
"ring-343.txt".

When you eat a leash with a monster on the other side, this monster gets
unleashed.

If you eat the iron ball or the chain while you are punished, the
punishment is gone. If you eat the chain, the ball is still available to
use as a weapon or to throw.

When you try to eat something rustproof while being polymorphed into a
rust monster, you spit it out non-rustproof and get stunned a few rounds.

Eating a poisoned weapon has the same effect as eating poisonous corpses.
You get poisoned if you're not resistant.

Eating a non-cursed trident exercises wisdom. (This is apparently a
US-centric pun having something to do with a brand of chewing gum.)
"That was pure chewing satisfaction!"

Eating a non-cursed flint stone exercises constitution. "Yabba-dabba
delicious!" (Note however that there are no monsters capable of eating
flint stones in the present version.)

Gems and stones are listed above by category, then by decreasing price.
The COST field denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the
weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).

Gems comprise 8% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
18% in containers, 0% on the Rogue level, and 10% in hell.  PROB
is the relative probability of each subtype, except for those marked
with an asterisk (valuable gems); the figures so marked instead
represent the first level on which the gems can occur (this limitation
only applying to the main dungeon, and these restrictions are only
reviewed when creating a new level).  Permissible valuable gems have
roughly equal probabilities of being generated among themselves, always
set such that the total for the category as a whole is 171.

Loadstones are always generated cursed (except potentially in containers),
all others are uncursed.  Rocks appear in piles of 6 to 11.  Valuable gems,
worthless gems, touchstones, and flint stones have a 1/6 chance of appearing
in a pile of 2.

The ENGR field denotes how the gem appears when you attempt to engrave
with it (see below).  COLORS specifies the possible appearance of the
gem.  If more than one color is possible, then one will be randomly
chosen for the appearance.


Identifying stones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are five different types of non-gem stones, and four of them
are indistinguishably gray.

rock
  Rocks are immediately identified on examination, and pose little
  difficulty or challenge to the adventurer. They make a cheap and usually
  plentiful source of ammunition, should you lack or wish to conserve other
  ranged attacks. ("Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that." -- Bart Simpson)

touchstone
  Touchstones are most readily distinguished by their effect when rubbed
  with something hard, such as an iron weapon; they will make a "scritch,
  scritch" sound. Their primary use is rubbing them with other gems and
  stones (and, once identified, this is all they _can_ be used for); if
  blessed (or also if uncursed, for Archeologists and gnomes), the object
  rubbed with will be identified. The complete table of results that
  distinguish them is as follows:

  GRAY STONE        GEM       GLASS     HARD     RING
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~
  good touchstone   ID        ID        scritch  streak
  bad touchstone    streak    scratch   scritch  streak
  other gray stone  cscratch  cscratch  scratch  cscratch

  where "streak" denotes coloured streaks, "scratch" uncoloured scratch
  marks, "cscratch" coloured scratch marks, and "scritch" the sound
  "scritch scritch".

  Other types of object may produce coloured streaks or scratches, but
  will not provide any further useful information.

  Note that being rubbed on a cursed touchstone may shatter gems or rocks
  (but not other gray stones).


luckstone
  Luckstones can be identified by their effect (see "Luck" below) with the
  help of enlightenment, by their valuation by shopkeepers, or by the
  presence of the guaranteed luckstone at the top of a gems cache in the
  Gnome King's Wine Cellar version of the bottom level of the Gnomish Mines.
  (Or, indeed, by the Heart of Ahriman being one).

loadstone
  As noted above, loadstones are almost always generated cursed; furthermore,
  they autocurse on being dropped or otherwise leaving the main inventory,
  and a cursed loadstone cannot be let go of. It is therefore best to
  identify them while they lie on the ground; kicking them will usually
  elicit a "Thump!" rather than movement across the floor, but being
  extremely strong (at least 22 strength; 18/** is not sufficient) while
  wearing kicking boots or being a Samurai or Monk may allow some movement
  (watch how far it goes).
  
flint stone
  These exist primarily to make it hard to identify touchstones, loadstones
  and luckstones, and are best identified by elimination of the other three.
  They have few special properties, but do inflict somewhat more damage than
  other stones or gems when used as sling ammunition.


Identifying gems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Quoted in part from the spoiler "gems" by Bryan Butler.)

    "I shall, with cultured taste,
     Distinguish gems from paste..."
         -- Reginald Bunthorne, in Gilbert and Sullivan's "Patience"

There are now nine methods to identify gems: engraving, throwing at
unicorns, killing glass golems, spell of stone to flesh, collecting a
large number, scrolls or spells of identify, a touchstone, dipping
an amethyst in potions of booze, and finding pre-placed gems.

1.  Engraving with gems

If a gem is listed as "hard" above, then you will see the following
message when you attempt to (E)ngrave with the gem:
    "You engrave in the <floor> with the <gem>."
where <gem> is the appearance of the gem.  All hard gems are valuable,
although some colors may have more than one possible identity.

If the gem is "soft," you will see this message:
    "You write in the dust with the <gem>."
Soft gems may be valuable or worthless, so you will need an additional
method to identify these gems.

In either case, you can abort the engraving process by pressing Escape.
If you choose to write a message, it will take one turn per character
to engrave.  Not all types of floor can be engraved upon.  You may choose
to #name a gem once you know its hardness (e.g., "soft blue").

2.  Throwing gems at unicorns

Throwing a gem to a non-tame unicorn can change your luck in one of several
ways, depending on whether the gem is worthless or valuable, whether you
are the same alignment as the unicorn (white = lawful, gray = neutral,
and black = chaotic), and whether the gem type is already identified or
named.

  VALUE  ALIGN  KNOWN       ADVERB        LUCK CHANGE
  ~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  glass  other  unknown     graciously         0
  glass  other  named       (see below*)       0
  glass  other  identified  (see below*)       0
  glass  same   unknown     graciously         0
  glass  same   named       (see below*)       0
  glass  same   identified  (see below*)       0
   gem   other  unknown     hesitatingly   -1 to +1
   gem   other  named       hesitatingly   -1 to +1
   gem   other  identified  hesitatingly   -3 to +3
   gem   same   unknown     gratefully        +1
   gem   same   named       gratefully        +2
   gem   same   identified  gratefully        +5

In most cases, the message sequence is as follows:
    "The <unicorn> neighs!  The <unicorn> catches the <gem>."
    "The <unicorn> <ADVERB> accepts your gift."
where the color of the unicorn and the color of the gem are appropriate
for the situation. <ADVERB> comes from the table above, except where
the column has a *, in which case there is a different message sequence:
    "The <unicorn> neighs!"
    "The <unicorn> catches the <glass>."
    "The <unicorn> is not interested in your junk."
after which the unicorn will promptly drop the "gem".

3. Killing glass golems

When a glass golem is destroyed, it leaves behind 2 to 8 worthless
pieces of glass (each of which can be any of the colours), and
never gems.

4. Spell of stone to flesh

The spell of stone to flesh will turn gemstones into meatballs, but
leave worthless pieces of glass intact; #name a gem 'valuable' or
similar before zapping the spell at it (and rename it afterwards should
it be proven untrue), since it won't be around to #name after.

5.  Collecting a large number of gems

If you wait long enough, you'll accumulate a large number of gems.
Since the probabilities of getting worthless pieces of glass are so
much higher than getting true gems, you'll acquire them much faster
than other gems. So, if you just wait long enough, and look at all of
the gems of a certain color that you have, more often than not the gem
of which you have the most is the worthless piece of glass. This is a
bit risky, and usually takes much more time than other methods.

6. Scrolls and spells of identify

You can always use a scroll or spell of identify to determine whether a
gem is valuable.  You will then recognize all gems of that same type,
although you can lose this knowledge from a scroll of amnesia or (master)
mind flayer attack. Shopkeepers will buy identified gems
based on their full price; this is a good way to get money.

7.  Rubbing on a touchstone

Being rubbed on a blessed touchstone (or also uncursed for Archeologists,
who start with one, and gnomes) will immediately identify any gem, as
detailed under "touchstones" above.

8.  Dipping amethysts into potions of booze

When you dip an amethyst into a potion(s) of booze, the potion will turn
into fruit juice ("a-methyst" means not intoxicated).  You can use this
very special case to identify this type of soft violet gems.

9.  Pre-placed gems

Certain levels are guaranteed to be generated with diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, and amethysts in well-defined positions.  Two versions of
the bottom level of the Gnomish Mines (the Wine Cellar version and the
Mimic of the Mines version) contain concealed chambers with these four
types of gems and a guaranteed luckstone, together with assorted other
* to confuse identification; the third version's are randomly
scattered across the level.  The four corner rooms of Fort Ludios (if
it is reachable in your game) each contain one of these four types of
valuable gems.  Other levels may also be generated with piles of gems,
but their type is not guaranteed, so these levels are not helpful in
determining the identity of gems.


Luck
~~~~
Luck is included here because of luckstones.

Your luck affects many aspects of the game (too many to mention here),
and is actually the sum of two components.  Base luck changes with events
in the game, and may slowly return to a "baseline" level.  Bonus luck, on
the other hand, is determined by what kind of luckstone (and certain
artifacts) you are carrying.  Only a rough idea of your luck is given
in the enlightenment list; the meaning of the messages is as follows:
  TOTAL LUCK  MESSAGE
  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <= -10    extremely unlucky
   -9 to -5   very unlucky
   -4 to -1   unlucky
       0      luck is zero (debug mode only)
    1 to 4    lucky
    5 to 9    very lucky
    >= 10     extremely lucky

Your bonus luck -- and whether your base luck will return to its baseline
level -- is controlled by luckstones and certain Quest Artifacts.  The
effect of these "luckitems" depends on the number in your main inventory
that are blessed, uncursed, and cursed (see table below).  Note that you
can't do any better than one blessed luckitem, so you might as well keep
any others in a bag (where they have no effect) as spares in case your
main one is cursed.
  NUMBER OF LUCKITEMS          BAD LUCK    GOOD LUCK   BONUS LUCK
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~
  None                         Times out   Times out   0 (no message)
  More cursed than blessed     No timeout  Times out
  Equal cursed and blessed     No timeout  No timeout
  More blessed than cursed     Times out   No timeout
  More cursed than non-cursed                          -3 "reduced luck"
  Equal cursed and non-cursed                          +3 "extra luck"
  More non-cursed than cursed                          +3 "extra luck"
When you are enlightened about your luck, you are also told if you have
bonus luck and if good/bad luck will not time out.

Base luck is adjusted by each of the events described below.  It cannot
be reduced below -10 or increased above +10 beyond the baseline.  In
addition, every 600 turns (or 300 if you have the Amulet of Yendor or have
angered your god), your luck will increase by one if it is less than your
baseline luck and bad luck times out, and your luck will decrease by one if
your luck is greater than your baseline luck and good luck times out.  Your
baseline luck is +1 if you started or restored the game during a full moon,
-1 if started/restored on Friday the 13th, and 0 if neither or both.

Potion messages and effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the WCST spoiler "spoil803".)

What happens when you (q)uaff a potion usually depends on whether the
potion was blessed, uncursed, or cursed.  If a monster can quaff a potion,
the effects upon the monster are documented below; all other potions won't
be quaffed by monsters. 

When a potion hits a monster, the monster will be awoken and has an 80%
chance of losing one hit point (but not killed), and then suffers the
effects described below.  If you didn't see the monster get hit, you will
be told, "Crash!".  Monsters are not angered by potions of (extra|full)
healing, (gain|restore) ability, speed, invisibility, water thrown at
gremlins, or unholy water thrown at werecreatures, demons or undead; other
potions will cause peaceful monsters to become hostile if you were the
thrower.

If a potion hits you, you lose 1 to 2 hit points and get the effects of
breathing vapors described below unless the potion has a specific effect
for hitting you.  You may also breathe vapors if you are near a potion
when it breaks (e.g., it hit a monster, was hit by a wand of striking, or
was kicked). If you are polymorphed into an unbreathing monster, the
vapours will get into your eyes for the same effect. If you are polymorphed
into a monster that neither breathes nor has eyes, vapours will have no
effect.

acid
  Cures stoning.
  If you are acid resistant, no effect.
    "This tastes sour." (not hallucinating)
    "This tastes tangy." (hallucinating)
  blessed
    You lose 1 to 4 hit points, and abuse your constitution.
      "This burns a little!"
  uncursed
    You lose 1 to 8 hit points, and abuse your constitution.
      "This burns like acid!"
  cursed
    You lose 2 to 16 hit points, and abuse your constitution.
      "This burns a lot!"
  hits monster
    The monster loses the same number of hit points as you would on
    quaffing the potion. Some monsters may resist.
      "<monster> shrieks in pain!"
      "<monster> writhes in pain!" (silent monster)
  hits you
    May be thrown by monsters.
    If you are acid resistant, no effect. Otherwise, same effect as
    quaffing potion.
  vapors
    Abuses your constitution.
