Most items that can explode are magical.  Most explosions will cause [[damage]] to the adventurer or monster that provokes them; some explosions can cause damage in the surrounding [[square]]s as well.

Some types of explosions are listed here.

==Dark explosion==
Dark explosions have [[tileset|tile]]s assigned to them, but are nowhere invoked in the program.

==Noxious explosion==
A noxious explosion results from a [[gas spore]] bursting.  It does physical damage to any nearby creature; the gas spore itself dies in the process.

==Muddy explosion==
Muddy explosions have [[tileset|tile]]s assigned to them, but are nowhere invoked in the program.

==Wet explosion==
Wet explosions have [[tileset|tile]]s assigned to them, but are nowhere invoked in the program.

==Magical explosion==
Magical explosions result from the destruction of a [[magic trap]] or from attempting to place a [[wand of cancellation]], [[bag of holding]], or [[bag of tricks]] into a [[bag of holding]].  Magical explosions that cause damage to nearby [[square]]s result from breaking most types of [[wand]]s.

Magical explosions do magical damage to creatures without [[magic resistance]].

==Fiery explosion==
A fiery explosion results from any of these acts:
* breaking a [[wand of fire]]
* casting the [[fireball]] spell; causes multiple explosions if at [[Skill|skilled]] or better
* throwing a burning [[potion of oil]]
* dipping a lit [[lamp]] into a potion of oil
* reading a [[scroll of fire]]; does damage to surrounding [[square]]s if blessed

Fiery explosions do [[fire]] damage to creatures without [[fire resistance]], destroy [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s and [[spellbook]]s, and melt [[ice]].

==Frosty explosion==
A frosty explosion results from breaking a [[wand of cold]] or from casting {{spell of|cone of cold}} at [[Skill]]ed or better.  All such explosions damage surrounding [[square]]s.  Frosty explosions do [[cold]] damage to creatures without [[cold resistance]], destroy [[potion]]s, and freeze [[water]] and [[lava]].

&&%s&& %s Gehennom mapping {147690 2022-08-20T01:16:09Z {4001042 Bleem} /* Demon mapping */ note copied from Asmodeus page [[Gehennom]] contains a large number of [[maze]] levels. Maze levels always fill the map, unlike dungeon levels, and you can only map a few squares per turn by wandering around. Digging is slow, because wands or spells of digging can only dig 1 square per-shot on a maze level.

This has given Gehennom a reputation as a slow and boring phase of the game. But the amount of work involved can be greatly reduced by good strategy.

Depending on your [[role]] and equipment, '''Gehennom mapping''' can be made a lot faster, but writing and using a lot of magic-mapping scrolls uses up marker charges, which is a luxury that can't always be afforded. Thus, most players will want to expend minimal resources on it—[[wishing]] up a [[spellbook of magic mapping]] is not cost-effective unless you really have wishes to burn.

==Alternate level method==
This is a way of simply halving the effort required to map Gehennom.

Observation: If you map a level, either by magic mapping, or manual exhaustive search, you find both the upstair and the downstair.

Observation: going down the downstair on level N puts you on the upstair of level N+1; going up the upstair on level N puts you on the downstair of level N-1.

So, if you map level N-1 and level N+1, you can find the stairs on level N without mapping it - go down the downstair from N-1 and you find its upstair, and going up the upstair from level N+1 gives you its downstair.

Conclusion - if you can map level N, N+2, N+4, ... through Gehennom, you get all the others for free.

Typical application of the alternate level method is: you arrive on level N+1 by the stairs, so you know where the upstair is. Step aside & dig down, falling through to level N+2. Map N+2; go to the upstair, go up, and you now know the downstair for level N+1. Go back down, go to the downstair for level N+2; go down to N+3. Rinse and repeat.

A source of digging is therefore required. I normally carry a pick-axe, so I don't kick myself later on for using up all the wands of digging. Note in particular that, because you don't fully map level N+1, you don't know the most efficient way between the stairs, so you usually need to dig a path between them; this can get expensive on digging, so a pick-axe is recommended.

One caveat with this strategy of mapping only alternate levels is that later on, when you are dragged down by the [[mysterious force]], you may land in an unmapped area of the level.  Therefore, it is a good idea to have [[teleport control]] so that you can teleport directly to the upstairs when this happens.

===Finding Vlad's Tower===
If the castle is at level C, you may need to map all of C+9 to C+13 to find the upstair leading to Vlad's (which can't be found via the alternate level method). If you aren't short of mapping, do them all as you encounter them; if you are tight for resources, do C+9, C+11, C+13 as per the method, and only go back and do the others if you haven't found the stairs for Vlad's yet.

===Known levels===
If you are happy to be spoiled by reading the [[Gazetteer]], or have played through [[Gehennom]] before, you'll know the layout of the major demon lairs (listed on [[Special level]]). So you know where the downstairs are on those 4 levels, and know roughly where the upstairs are. So you can treat those levels as already-mapped; if you find a demon lair on level N, you can restart the alt level method from there, mapping N+2, N+4 etc.

If you get lucky, you find demon lairs on alternate levels, and don't have to do any mapping at all.

===The vibrating square level===
Most players will want to avoid magically mapping the level with the [[vibrating square]]. So once you are below the fake wizard's towers, switch to just digging down until you hit rock bottom. Hopefully that's in just 1 or 2 levels, otherwise you have a trickier job heading up mapping to find the upstairs (you could level teleport back above after finding the VS and go back to applying the alternate level method, once you know which level the VS is on).

==Mapping equipment==
Depends on the equipment you have.

===Spell of magic mapping===
If you have plenty of magic power, no need to be clever, map every level.

But most non-wizards don't regenerate magic power very fast, so have to be more economical. Use the alternate level method - it greatly reduces the number of levels you actually need to cast mapping on.

Wishing up a spellbook of magic mapping simply isn't worth it - wish for a magic marker and write [[Scroll of magic mapping]] as you need them - cheap to write.

If playing a [[wizard]], while you can write a [[spellbook of magic mapping]], this is normally not cost-effective; for the ~36 marker charges it uses on average, you can instead get 6 mapping scrolls, so assuming you have around two mapping scrolls already in stock (you'll usually have found a few during the game so far), you get maybe 8 mapping scrolls total which is enough for Gehennom using the alternate level method. And the cost is on-demand instead of up-front, so if you suddenly desperately need something else instead, you haven't used up the option; and mapping scrolls can be squeezed out of almost-exhausted markers, whereas the magic mapping spellbook needs a marker with 50 charges to be safe.

===Spell, combined with charging===
If you have a large number of levels to map in a short time, it becomes more economical to [[magic marker|write]] a [[spellbook of magic mapping]] and lots of [[scroll of charging|charging scrolls]] to replenish your [[magical energy]]. Such a case is e.g. a [[speed run]] after [[digging for victory]].

===Scrolls of magic mapping===
This is the main strategy. Most players will have a magic marker, by finding or wishing; most will also have found 2–3 mapping scrolls by chance earlier in the game.

Use the alternate level method; to map, use any scrolls of mapping you have first, then write more if you have charges to spare and some blank scrolls. Usually by this late in the game you have already done any armor/weapon enchanting, and otherwise gotten all the stuff you need, so you don't typically have anything else to save marker charges for (except perhaps for [[portal detection methods|portal detection]] - don't forget this!).

===Clairvoyance spell===
If you can't afford enough mapping scrolls, next best is [[clairvoyance]]. The spell requires only basic skill in [[divination]] to cast well. In your mind divide the level up into roughly 8x2 chunks, aim to get to the middle of each chunk and cast the spell to minimize overlap in the 10x10 area revealed. It reveals the layout of the maze and reveals any stairs in range.

===Clairvoyance extrinsic/intrinsic===
You can also get clairvoyance as an extrinsic or temporary intrinsic. This causes the same effect as the clairvoyance spell, but it occurs at random intervals instead of under the player's control. This doesn't cost any magic power or require any magic skill. The best way to use this seems to be to wander around like you are manually mapping, but don't worry about exploring every corner and instead try to push into new areas so you get more mapped by each random clairvoyance.

To get temporary clairvoyance, [[donate]] 200*XL to the priest of [[Moloch]] in the [[Valley]] and get clairvoyance for 500-999 turns per donation. (You should drop all your gold first and pick it up gradually, because you will not get the effect if you do not give more than {{frac|3}} of your visible gold.){{refsrc|src/priest.c|609|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=After donation, you get clairvoyance if your donation was greater than half your remaining visible gold, i.e. {{frac|3}} of your pre-donation gold.}} Two or three donations can give you enough time to map out a significant portion of [[Gehennom]], especially if you go relatively quickly to minimize the amount of overlap of each automatic "firing" of the clairvoyance.

Wizards can get extrinsic clairvoyance by wearing a [[cornuthaum]]. This certainly isn't worth a wish, though, since you can wish for a marker and write magic mapping instead.

Note that the [[Amulet of Yendor]] also gives extrinsic clairvoyance when carried. But once you have the amulet, you can't do the alternate level method, and you are being harassed by the Wizard, so most players will prefer to have mapped out Gehennom before that.

===Manual search===
Exhaustive manual exploration. Tedious, but if you don't have the marker charges to spare, this is your fallback.

Note that you are still better off using the alternate level method - much better off, if you value your time. You're only having to manually explore half of the levels; equivalently, it is a better use of time to search a whole level looking for 2 (or 3) stairs than to be looking for only 1.

Manual exploration time is reduced maybe 25% if you have a [[lamp]], because you can see that bit further and don't need to walk down to the end of every little side passage. A [[magic lamp]] is ideal, since you can just leave it on; an oil lamp is okay, but you want a lamp for the ascension run, so be careful not to use up your last lamp. But if you have a lamp or [[potion of oil]] to spare, just keep your lamp on (except when retracing steps).

The [[Eyes of the Overworld]] are better than a lamp, but certainly not worth wishing for just to help mapping—a magic marker to write mapping scrolls is a better wish.

Manual search does have advantages. Firstly, Gehennom has a fair amount of equipment lying around - and if you are short on mapping scrolls and marker charges, perhaps you are short of kit generally. Blessed potions of object detection can be used to detect items around the level & reveal the type of some items; as you are wandering around the level, and the stairs are just as likely to be in one place as another, you might as well start by heading towards any interesting items.

Watch out for [[fire trap]]s - if you don't have intrinsic [[searching]], you are likely to get burned a few times. If you have high [[Luck]] and bless your cloth/leather armor items, they are unlikely to get burnt.

==Demon mapping==
If you have cold resistance, telepathy, teleport control and enough sources of teleports (ideally the [[teleportitis]] intrinsic) then you can let [[Asmodeus]] find all the upstairs and downstairs in Gehennom for you once you have found his lair.  The cold resistance is needed so that Asmodeus can't hurt you as you chase him up through Gehennom.

With Asmodeus next to you, level teleport to the vibrating square level (specifying level 70 should work).  Hit him until he teleports away to the upstairs, and use telepathy to see where he is.  Teleport next to him and hit him until he runs upstairs.  Follow him and repeat this procedure until the stairs on every level are located. It is a good idea to use a [[stethoscope]] to make sure you don't accidentally kill him.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You can no longer teleport to the stairs if Asmodeus is on the level in Gehennom. Jumping is effective as an alternative.}}

SLASH'EM adds new spells, changes the difficulty of some existing spells, and has different limits on which roles can cast which spells.

==SLASH'EM spellbooks==

SLASH'EM spells, like vanilla ones, are organized into schools; but SLASH'EM has Protection instead of Clerical, and Body instead of Escape.

SLASH'EM spells are listed below, with the type and level the spell has in vanilla NetHack if that is different.

Reading a non-cursed spellbook is always successful in SLASH'EM, unless it has no charges (see below).  Cursed spellbooks still have the usual negative effects, though.

SLASH'EM spellbooks can be read a whopping 30 times before they finally fade.

==Spellbook charges==
Spellbooks are [[charge]]able in SLASH'EM, much like wands or tools.  Contrary to what one might expect, charges do not represent how many times the book can be read before fading (it's always 30 times).  Instead, charged spellbooks can be read more easily: when reading a non-cursed charged spellbook, one charge is consumed, and ''"The words on the page seem to glow faintly."''  This allows you to read the spellbook normally should you fail the reading roll (for uncursed spellbooks), and triples the reading speed otherwise.

Spellbooks are normally generated with 2-4 charges.  They follow the same recharging rules as [[charging#Wands|wands]] (including the distinction between directional and non-directional spells, strangely enough), except that a recharge has only a 50% chance of incrementing the recharge counter.  Blanked or faded spelbooks retain their charges and recharge count, although both will be set to zero after [[magic marker|writing]] on them.

==Spell timeout==
Successfully reading a spellbook will grant knowledge of the spell for 10,000 turns. Re-reading the spellbook for a known spell will increase the timeout by 10,000 turns if the timeout is below 60,000 turns. A successful casting of a spell will also increase the timeout by 500 turns{{refsrc|spell.c|1152|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}. Finally, the [[Reinforce memory]] technique possessed by [[Wizard]]s, [[Flame mage]]s, [[Ice mage]]s, and [[Necromancer]]s will increase knowledge of a usable spell by 10,000 turns. Thus spellbook management is significantly more lenient in SLASH'EM than vanilla NetHack, as any spell that is successfully cast every 500 turns will never be forgotten. Spells that are likely to be used often, such as a Wizard's [[magic missile]], can simply be read once and abandoned. Careful spell management can allow a spellcaster to completely avoid the task of both carrying heavy spellbooks and maintaining a stash of more spellbooks.

==Casting from health==
If you do not have enough energy to cast a spell and are at least skilled in that school, you will be prompted to cast the spell anyway{{refsrc|spell.c|894|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}. Doing so will drain all of your remaining power. For each additional point of power needed to cast the spell you will lose 1 HP and 2 nutrition, however this will not drain your nutrition below 1. If you are killed by the HP loss, the cause of death will be given as "spellcasting exhaustion". Finally, if you are not an expert you will also abuse wisdom.

==Roles and skills==

SLASH'EM is generally more permissive than NetHack in terms of spell skill limits; several roles can reach at least Basic in all schools.

Roles and their skill limits are shown below.

== Spell success rate calculation ==

Spell success rate calculation is somewhat different from [[Spellcasting#Calculating spell success rate|vanilla NetHack]].
* Base chance is calculated as in NetHack.
* Spellcasting penalty is calculated as follows:
** Find the row corresponding to your role in the spellcasting penalties table (use table from [[Spellcasting#Calculating spell success rate|NetHack spellcasting article]] for roles not mentioned here).
** Start from the base penalty value. 
** If casting a spell from Healing school, add value from "Healing" column ("Emergency" column if using table from NetHack spellcasting article).
** If wearing a shield, add value from "Shield" column.
** If wearing any suit other than [[robe]], [[robe of power]] or [[robe of protection]], add 5.
** If wearing a [[metal]]lic [[suit]], add value from "Suit" column.
** Add 6 if wearing metallic [[gloves]], 4 if wearing a metallic [[helmet]] other than [[helm of brilliance]], and 2 if wearing metallic [[boots]].
** If wearing a robe of power, subtract 3.
** If the spell is a "special spell" for your role, add the special modifier, currently -4 for all roles.
** If penalty < 5, set it to 5.
* Calculate difficulty and actual chance as in NetHack.
Overall, the [[robe of power]] is less than half as effective than a [[robe]] in NetHack, and doesn't boost success rates for already good spellcasters (unless they're wearing metallic armor). Due to that, [[Barbarian]]s can't ever achieve reliable casting, and [[Caveman|Cavemen]] can only achieve reliable casting with their special spell while wearing a robe of power.

== Miscellaneous differences from vanilla NetHack ==

* Most spells which give the effect of a wand/potion/scroll, when cast at Skilled [[skill]] level give the effect of a blessed one; [[spellbook of enchant armor]] and [[spellbook of enchant weapon]] are exceptions. Thus, [[spellbook of invisibility|invisibility spell]] cast at Skilled gives the [[player]] permanent [[invisibility]], which probably wasn't intended.

I wrote this from wizmoding in my own local copy In ''[[NetHack]]'', monsters have some degree of innate '''magic resistance''', also known as '''monster MR'''. Monsters' magic resistance allows them to resist various attacks, generally of a "magical" nature. It is handled by the resist() function&mdash;if a monster successfully resists an attack, it takes roughly half damage.{{refsrc|zap.c|4802|nethack=3.6.0}} Players cannot ever gain monster-style resistance, e.g. through [[polymorph]], and must instead rely upon [[magic cancellation]] and [[magic resistance]].

Monster magic resistance is separate from the [[magic resistance]] propery provided by various worn or carried [[item]]s, which some monsters such as [[gray dragon]]s and [[Angel]]s also have intrinstically; this form of "player-style" magic resistance does not affect [[taming]] and [[conflict]], but renders [[polymorph trap]]s ineffective. Neither type of magic resistance will protect monsters from level teleporters.

==Description==
MR is given as a number from 0 to 100. This is frequently given as a percentage, although this is not entirely accurate. The chance of a monster resisting is given as follows:

 Chance = MR/(100 + (attack level) - (defense level)){{refsrc|zap.c|4842|nethack=3.6.0}}

which is only equal to MR as a percentage when attack and defense level are equal. Zero MR monsters will never resist.

Attack level is calculated as follows, where the defense level is the [[monster level]] of the target, which has a maximum of 50:

{|class="prettytable"
! Source
! Attack level
|-
| [[spellcasting|spell]]
| Caster's level
|-
| [[wand]], [[polytrap]]{{refsrc|trap.c|2588|nethack=3.6.0}}
| 12
|-
| [[tool]]
| 10
|-
| [[weapon]]
| 10
|-
| [[scroll]]
| 9
|-
| [[potion]]
| 6
|-
| [[ring]]
| 5
|}

All this also determines the chance that monsters (including [[pet]]s resist conflict; conflict from the [[Sceptre of Might]] is treated the same as the [[ring of conflict]] for this purpose.

{{todo|A list of all effects subject to monster mr, and/or confirmation that all those effects mention they are subject to it and link here.}}

==Strategy==
Monster magic resistance generally determines what strategies are effective against certain monsters - for examples, the [[Riders]] have complete monster magic resistance, but {{monsymlink|Pestilence}} and {{monsymlink|Famine}} can be subjected to [[level drain]], making it possible for magical effects to work on them if their level is drained enough; {{monsymlink|Death}} is completely resistant to drain life.

==Messages==
{{message|<[[Foo]]> resists!|A monster resisted an attack; this is shown only in some cases.}}

==Variants==
Some variants change the monster magic resistance stats for certain monsters that are included from vanilla ''NetHack'', and may additionally change the name to further distinguish it from the magic resistance property.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], this stat is referred to as '''magic saving throw''' in the monster lookup; various monsters added from ''NetHack'' and other variants also have their magic saving throw improved.

===NetHack Fourk===
[[NetHack Fourk]] refers to this stat as '''willpower'''.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], this stat is also called '''willpower''', with the attacker bonus from wands dependent on the [[Wands Balance Patch|wand skill]].

===xNetHack===
[[xNetHack]] calls this stat '''magic saving throw'''.

E.g.

 <nowiki>{{monsymlink|Death}}</nowiki>

points to character [[Death]] not the monster [[Riders#Death]].

Several pages that mean to link to the monster Death lead to the page about character death instead. The monsymlink template has no way around this. The best I can think of is:

 <nowiki>{{monsym|Death}} [[Riders|Death]]</nowiki>

(there's no point in linking to [[Riders#Death]] as the page ends up in the wrong place when the monster templates shrink, at least on my browsers (Firefox 2.0.0.l4, MSIE 7.0.5370.11, Safari 3.1.1(525.17))

Is this state of affairs OK, or should all monster names be used for the monster, or either the monster or a disambiguation page? Or should  the monsymlink template be enhanced to allow an alternative link?

Note that in the case of [[Death]], it used to be about character death, then both that and the monster, then it was a symlink to [[Riders]], then it became about character death...

A fleeing monster will generally try to move away from your position in a random direction. However, it can still use [[ranged attack]]s, including offensive [[wand]]s and [[breath weapon]]s - it will even use [[melee]] attacks if the monster happens to be next to you and cannot get away. [[Followers]] that are scared will not pursue you down or up [[stairs]].

Technically, ''NetHack'' has two different [[properties]]: "scared" and "fleeing", with the fleeing behavior being what players generally see. A fleeing monster has a 4% chance to recover per monster move, unless it has a predetermined duration.{{refsrc|Monmove.c|357}} A monster that is "scared" cannot attack; this status property can be seen via [[probing]] (e.g. by a [[stethoscope]]). It typically lasts as long as the monster is next to [[Elbereth]], the player is playing a [[tooled horn]], or similar.<ref>[[Monmove.c#line513]] resets scaredness after each monster movement.</ref>

==Effect==
If you are [[grabbing attack|grabbed]] or [[engulf]]ed by a monster, scaring it will cause it to release or expel you.{{refsrc|monmove.c|215|comment=scaring a monster releases you}}

A fleeing monster will usually try to get further away from you{{refsrc|monmove.c|716|comment=monster runs away}} unless it is trapped{{refsrc|monmove.c|614|comment=trapped monsters can't run away}} or eating.{{refsrc|monmove.c|621|comment=eating monsters don't run away}} However, it will retrace its steps only around 25% of the time;{{refsrc|monmove.c|935}} if you scare a monster in a narrow corridor, it will have nowhere to go and just stand still, attacking you.<ref>[https://github.com/tung/NitroHack/commit/f71440b50978c44587b58c1f2d6c39aedd8474b7 Nitrohack and DynaHack fix this bug.]</ref>

The following monsters have special code to handle their movements, and will not always move away from you while scared:

*[[pet]]s{{refsrc|monmove.c|644|comment=pets have special movement}}
*[[shopkeeper]]s{{refsrc|monmove.c|644|comment=shopkeepers have special movement}}
*{{monsymlink|guard}}s{{refsrc|monmove.c|658|comment=guards have special movement}}
*[[covetous]] monsters{{refsrc|monmove.c|665|comment=covetous monsters have special movement}}
*{{monsymlink|aligned priest}}s{{refsrc|monmove.c|685|comment=aligned priests have special movement}}

A fleeing monster may attack you in melee if it blunders into you when you are [[invisible]] or [[displacement|displaced]], or if it is [[confused]], [[stun]]ned, [[blind]]ed,{{refsrc|monmove.c|979|comment=impaired monsters may attack you}} or cornered. Monsters will never melee when adjacent to a square they think is protected by sanctuary, Elbereth, or a scroll of scare monster (or an altar if a vampire).{{refsrc|monmove.c|548|comment=Sanctuary, Elbereth and scare monster prevent attacks altogether}}

Monsters will still use [[ranged attack]]s while fleeing.

A monster will stop fleeing when any time has expired. If the scaring is untimed, it will stop fleeing 4% of the time on each move it makes, if its [[hit points]] are at maximum.{{refsrc|monmove.c|356|comment=ending an untimed scare}}

==Strategy==

There is no single perfect method of scaring enemies; all methods either allow monsters to [[Magic resistance (monster)|resist]] or have significant exceptions. Thus it pays to keep multiple methods available. For example, sanctuary or Elbereth will not scare a [[ki-rin]], but because this [[angelic being]] is not [[humanoid]], applying a mirror will scare it 80% of the time. A high-level player might scare it with a spell of cause fear, but this will be successful less frequently than the humble mirror.

Typically, you can rely on Elbereth in the early game, until you start meeting hostile {{white|@}} [[human or elf|humans or elves]]. Lower-difficulty monsters in this group typically have little or no [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] and can be scared by an instrument, spell, or wand. Later in the game, higher-difficulty {{white|A}} [[angelic being]]s and {{white|@}} [[human or elf|humans or elves]] have higher resistance and are thus harder to scare; however, at that point you will not need to scare monsters as often in order to survive.

The utility of scaring a monster depends on its behavior. If you want to avoid a monster's melee attack, scaring is is very useful. This makes it ideal for creatures such as {{monsymlink|cockatrice}}s and {{monsymlink|master mind flayer}}s. Once you have [[magic resistance]] and [[cold resistance]], however, scaring an {{monsymlink|arch-lich}} is of dubious benefit.

* You have no [[inventory]] space left, your [[encumbrance]] is too high or you are [[fumbling]] when you receive an item 'abnormally', such as from:
** a [[mail daemon]] delivering you a [[scroll of mail]]
** a [[wish]]
** a [[horn of plenty]]
* Quaffing from a [[sink]]; "From the murky drain, a hand reaches up... --oops--"
* When the game [[panic]]s; "Oops... Suddenly, the dungeon collapses."

&&%s&& %s Breath {140225 2021-05-24T19:55:18Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Types of breath weapons */ {{otheruses}}
Many monsters have '''breath weapons''' which they can deploy against you as a ranged attack.  Breath weapons are often vexing to low-level characters who do not have [[reflection]] or the appropriate [[resistance]].

==Types of breath weapons==
There are eight types of breath weapon:
{|class="wikitable"
!Weapon!!Monsters using it
|-
|[[Magic missile]]||{{monsymlink|gray dragon}}
|-
|[[Fire]]||{{monsymlink|hell hound pup}}<br/>{{monsymlink|hell hound}}<br/>{{monsymlink|red dragon}}<br/>{{monsymlink|red naga}}<br/>{{monsymlink|Ixoth}}
|-
|[[Cold]]||{{monsymlink|winter wolf cub}}<br/>{{monsymlink|winter wolf}}<br/>{{monsymlink|silver dragon}}<br/>{{monsymlink|white dragon}}
|-
|[[Sleep]] gas||{{monsymlink|orange dragon}}<br/>{{monsymlink|Nazgul}}
|-
|[[Disintegration]]||{{monsymlink|black dragon}}
|-
|[[Lightning]]||{{monsymlink|blue dragon}}
|-
|[[Poison]] gas||{{monsymlink|green dragon}}<br/>{{monsymlink|iron golem}}
|-
|[[Acid]]||{{monsymlink|yellow dragon}}
|}

The {{monsymlink|Chromatic Dragon}} can attack with any breath weapon, chosen at random when attacking.

In [[3.6.1]], poison breath also leaves behind a short-lived trail of [[poison cloud]]s.

==Defending against breath weapons==
There are basically four ways to defend against a breath weapon:
* Have [[reflection]]; any breath weapon that hits you will then be reflected, though all monsters are immune to their own breath weapons.
* Have the appropriate [[resistance]], either intrinsic or extrinsic.  This however does not protect your gear from [[fire]], [[cold]], or [[lightning]].  [[Disintegration resistance]], on the other hand, does extend to armor that would otherwise disintegrate.
* Fight the monster in [[melee]].  A monster will never use its breath weapon if it can hit in melee, unless it is [[impaired]].
* [[Cancellation|Cancel]] the monster.  It will then cough instead of blasting when it tries to use its breath weapon.

==Use of breath weapons while polymorphed==
While you are [[polymorph]]ed into a monster with a breath weapon, you can launch a breath blast by using the <tt>[[Monster (command)|#monster]]</tt> [[extended command]].  This uses 15 points of [[magical energy]].

==Use by pets==
In [[3.6.1]] and later, [[pet]]s can use their breath weapons against both [[hostile]] and [[peaceful]] monsters.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|1118|nethack=3.6.1}}  Unlike melee attacks, they can sometimes target monsters of much higher [[level]] than themselves, although attacking anything 5 or more levels higher that the pet is increasingly unlikely.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|777|nethack=3.6.1}}  Pets are much less likely to use a breath attack if they're hungry.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|1138|nethack=3.6.1}}  They will avoid to breathe in your (or other pets') direction, assuming you are not [[invisible]] or [[displaced]] and they're not [[confused]].{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|760|nethack=3.6.1}}  However, they can still hit you on a [[Ray#Bouncing rays|rebound]].

==SLASH'EM==
The following new [[SLASH'EM]] [[monster (SLASH'EM)|monster]]s have breath weapons:
{|class="wikitable"
!Weapon!!Monsters using it
|-
|[[Magic missile]]||{{monsym|shimmering_dragon}} [[shimmering dragon (SLASH'EM)|shimmering dragon]]<br/>{{white|'}} [[diamond golem]]
|-
|[[Fire]]||{{red|'}} [[ruby golem]]
|-
|[[Cold]]||{{brightblue|'}} [[steel golem]]
|-
|[[Sleep]] gas||{{orange|f}} [[kamadan]]
|-
|[[Lightning]]||{{brightcyan|'}} [[sapphire golem]]
|-
|[[Poison]] gas||{{magenta|D}} [[deep dragon]]
|}
In addition, {{brightblue|'}} [[crystal golem]]s use a random breath weapon like the Chromatic Dragon.

When you fire off a spell or zap a wand that has the ability to bounce of walls, using this technique will most of the time let you specify the direction of the bounce.

When this technique is used with the [[sigil of tempest]], you will be able to control the explosion as if you cast {{Spell of|fireball}} or {{Spell of|cone of cold}} at [[skilled]] level or above in vanilla [[NetHack]].

'''Human''' is a [[monster attribute]] that indicates that a [[monster]] should be considered ''human''.<ref name="M2_HUMAN">{{sourcecode|monflag.h|115}} monster attribute M2_HUMAN</ref> It has many effects, but most significantly it helps determine whether your actions constitute  [[cannibalism]], same-race [[sacrifice]], or [[murder]].

The human attribute should ''not'' be confused with the [[human or elf|{{white|@}}]] [[monster symbol]], even though they overlap significantly. For example, [[Keystone Kop|Kops]] are human but not {{white|@}}, and elves are {{white|@}} but not human.
