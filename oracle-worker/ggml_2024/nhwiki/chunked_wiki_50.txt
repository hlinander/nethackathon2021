[[Fire resistance]] is much less urgent if you detect and avoid [[fire trap]]s, e.g. with the {{spell of|detect unseen}} spell or the [[PYEC]] and a [[crystal ball]]. Spellcasters (especially Wizards with [[hungerless casting]]) can simply use skilled [[spellbook of detect monsters|monster detection]] to substitute for [[telepathy]].

Once you have reflection, can reliably avoid traps, have poison resistance, and have free action, the other resistances can generally be missed just fine.

== Variations ==
=== Speed ===

Ascending so quickly that nutrition never falls low enough to become a problem.

=== Atheist ===

Not [[pray]]ing to restore hunger, or being [[crowned]] for [[intrinsic]]s. Also includes all of the other [[atheist]] challenges (such as no divine protection and no [[altar]] [[BUC]] identification).

=== Liquid diet ===

Only restoring nutrition by [[quaff]]ing [[potion]]s, usually by using the [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]] as a [[Tourist]] on a [[horn of plenty]].

=== True polyselfless ===

Not [[polymorph]]ing into one's own [[race]] to restore hunger. Oddly enough, polying into one's own race does not break the [[polyselfless]] conduct.

=== Survivor ===

Not using any [[amulets of life saving]] to restore hunger.

=== Dual slow digestion ===

Abusing the [[dual ring of slow digestion bug]] to, ideally, never lose any points of nutrition.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The dual ring of slow digestion trick no longer works, as ring hunger is no longer deterministic.}}

The main effect of this is the lack of reading [[scroll]]s, no engraving [[Elbereth]] to protect yourself, and spellcasters being unable to learn from [[spellbook]]s.

==Rules of conduct==

===Literate actions===

* Reading a non-blank scroll or spellbook, [[novel]], [[t-shirt]], [[alchemy smock]], [[credit card]], [[magic marker]], [[candy bar]], [[gold piece]], or [[the Orb of Fate]].
** "Reading" a scroll while [[blind]] does break the conduct, as you must have understood the magic words to recite or cogitate them.
** A [[scroll of mail]] will warn you and give you a chance to abort, if the conduct is intact (this still consumes the scroll).
* Eating a [[fortune cookie]], or applying it to read the fortune, while not blind.
* Writing a scroll or a spellbook with a [[magic marker]].
* Engraving anything other than a single "x" or "X". This is determined by what you try to write, not what you end up writing if impaired or scrawling in the dust.
** The "x" does not have to be a new engraving -- adding one "x" at a time to an existing engraving is allowed.
** Engraving more than one "x" at a time -- for instance, "xx" -- is not allowed.
* Creating [[Sting]] or [[Orcrist]] by naming.{{refsrc|src/do_name.c|1296|nethack=3.6.1}}

===Permitted actions===

* Reading gravestones or engravings on the ground.
** You may also take advantage of pre-existing Elbereth engravings in [[Sokoban]], the [[Castle]], or [[bones]] levels.
* Eating a fortune cookie while blind.
* Standing on a [[scroll of scare monster]].
* Transforming an existing engraving by writing over it with a [[wand of polymorph]].
* Naming or calling items names (except when creating an artifact).
* Reading the [[Book of the Dead]], whether or not you're performing the [[Invocation]].
* "Reading" a [[scroll of blank paper]] or [[spellbook of blank paper]].
* Casting spells you already know at the start of the game ([[Healer]], [[Monk]], [[Priest]], [[Wizard]]).

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], random engravings and headstones are not automatically read when the player walks over the square, as in Vanilla. It is necessary to use {{kbd|r.|link=0}} to read these engravings - and doing so will violate illiterate conduct.  Additionally, the game will ask players who eat a fortune cookie if they want to read the fortune, meaning illiterate players can safely eat them by declining to do so.

==Tips==

===Elbereth===

A [[scroll of scare monster]] can be used in place of [[Elbereth]] by standing on top of the scroll. In fact, this is the only type of scroll that is ordinarily useful in an illiterate game. If you don't want to destroy the first one you find, you can price-ID scrolls inside a container, and test which 100zm scroll un-blesses when you pick it up.

Similar (but not identical) effects can be obtained by [[apply]]ing a [[mirror]], an [[expensive camera]], a [[leather drum]], a [[tooled horn]], or their depleted magical counterparts. Drums and horns are particularly useful. But keep in mind scaring tools work best in an open area, where a monster can actually flee without retracing its last step. (In a corridor, there is a 75% chance that it will [[bug#stuck_in_corridors|get stuck]] between you and the spot it came from -- and continue attacking you.{{refsrc|monmove.c|935}}<ref>[https://github.com/tung/NitroHack/commit/f71440b50978c44587b58c1f2d6c39aedd8474b7 Nitrohack fixes this bug.]</ref>)

===Monsters reading scrolls===

Scrolls of create monster, teleportation, and earth can be given to monsters to be read. For example, if you want a random monster, give an intelligent monster a [[scroll of create monster]]. The monster must usually be near death before it will read teleportation or create monster because that counts as a defensive action.{{refsrc|muse.c|1067}}

If you need [[boulder]]s in [[Sokoban]] or for a [[boulder fort|fort]], give a monster a [[scroll of earth]]. Reading earth qualifies as a "ranged" attack that is only used if you are adjacent. So you might have to give the scroll and a [[metal]] helmet to an "[[intelligent]]" monster and patiently let it hit on you.{{refsrc|muse.c|511}} Scaring or injuring the monster does not make it read earth faster. It can take quite some time, so have the means to heal yourself.

===Object identification===

You will not be able to use [[scroll of identify|scrolls of identify]] or [[spellbook of identify|spellbooks of identify]] (unless you are lucky enough to start with the spell as a [[Wizard]]). Formal identification is only possible (sometimes) by [[sit]]ting on a [[throne]]. The use of [[Identify#Indirect_identification|indirect identification]] is crucial in an illiterate game. [[Enlightenment]] is very helpful for identifying [[ring]]s and [[amulet]]s.

Since you can engrave "x" without breaking conduct, you can still engrave-test wands (including the ones that require an existing engraving -- write one "x" with your fingers, then a second with the wand). You can distinguish hard gems from soft ones by aborting at the writing prompt after you discover what type of writing you're going to make; however, it's probably not worth spending precious throne identifications on gems.

===Item enchantment===

Without scrolls, there is no way to [[enchant]] or [[erosion|erodeproof]] [[weapon]]s or [[armor]] items. It is also not possible to create [[DSM]] from dragon scales or a [[crysknife]] from a worm tooth. Enchanted erodeproof items can nevertheless be obtained by [[wish]]ing for them, or sometimes (if you're lucky) from a [[bones]] level. Erodeproof [[artifact]] weapons can be obtained by [[sacrifice|sacrificing]] or [[crowning]]. Weapon erosion (only) can be fixed using a [[potion of oil]] or (sometimes) through [[prayer]], but this will not make the weapon erodeproof. [[Grease]] can also help provide a temporary block against erosion.

One way to lower [[armor class]] without armor enchantment is to obtain [[intrinsic protection]]. [[Half physical damage]] can also help make up for a poor armor class. Similarly, lack of weapon enchantment can be offset by [[increase damage]], high [[strength]], or a weapon with high base damage (such as [[Mjollnir]]).

If you have a stethoscope, you can check a monster's armor class and infer the total enchantment of its armor. That saves you pet-testing and trying on what you find on its corpse.

===Recharging wands===

The only way to [[charging|recharge]] [[wand]]s (e.g. the [[wand of wishing]] from the [[Castle]]) without reading a scroll is to obtain the [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]].

===Genocide===

A limited number of [[genocide]]s can sometimes be obtained by [[sit]]ting on a [[throne]]. [[Reverse genocide]] is not possible, but some alternatives exist: [[wish]] for a [[figurine]], or (if you only care about an item obtained by killing a certain type of monster, e.g. [[cockatrice corpse]]) wish for the item directly.

===Trap detection===

To [[trap|detect traps]] such as the [[endgame]] [[portal]]s without reading a [[scroll of gold detection]], [[apply]] a [[crystal ball]]. Inside some [[vortex]] other than a [[dust vortex]] could be a safe place. Especially in the mines, two [[leash]]ed [[pet]]s can alert you to the traps.

===Book of the Dead loophole===

The blessed [[Book of the Dead]] can be used as defense against [[lich]]es and other undead.

===Stone to flesh===
A [[statue trap]] will {{spell of|stone to flesh}} the topmost statue on its square when you activate it. If you need a petrified pet restored, you can throw its statue on the trap before triggering it.

===SLASH'EM===
Shopkeeper services and the [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]] make illiterate conduct somewhat less of a challenge in SLASH'EM.  Shopkeepers can identify, enchant, rustproof, charge, or uncurse items for you.  One-Eyed Sam is guaranteed to have identify and uncursing, and it is possible for any player to build up huge amounts of credit in his shop through [[credit cloning]] with a hostile baby dragon and a [[wand of undead turning]].  Additionally, brave players can try to kill Sam to get a well-enchanted set of ascension kit armor, including [[GDSM]].  He does not resist poison, so a boulder fort combined with thrown poisoned missiles (remember, in SLASH'EM daggers can be poisoned) at good skill will eventually bring him down.

Because characters in SLASH'EM can "refresh" their memory of a spell by casting it, roles that start with low-level spells can cast them for the entire game, though they still won't be able to learn new ones.  Some roles, such as [[flame mage]]s and [[necromancer]]s, may need to use the [[reinforce memory]] [[technique]] to keep their highest-level spells from being forgotten before they reach a high enough experience level to cast them regularly.

==Accidental loss of conduct==

* If you must eat a fortune cookie, do it blind, so you don't read the message.
* Turn off the [[mail]] option, lest someone decide to have a chat with you. (You don't have to do this on [[NAO]], where [[bug#C343-320|bug C343-320]] is fixed.)

Illiteracy is difficult: Only 1.6% of all winning accounts on [[NAO]] have an illiterate ascension.

&&%s&& %s Pacifist {141621 2021-07-06T04:41:04Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Water and lava */ Typo {{featured}}
The '''pacifist''' [[conduct]] involves not actively killing any monster directly. Players must instead attack without killing, use a [[pet]] to do the dirty work, or simply run away.

A pacifist player nearly always uses a passive way of killing monsters, such as a pet, or a [[ring of conflict]] for larger groups. [[wand of teleportation|Wands of teleportation]] are used much more often to move a difficult monster somewhere else instead of killing it.

Many players use a [[wish]] for a "blessed [[figurine]] of an [[Archon]]", giving them a strong enough pet to attack the [[Wizard of Yendor]], as well as being a great help throughout the rest of the game.

==Breaking the conduct==
Obviously, if you get experience for the death of a monster, you break the conduct. However, there are a few corner cases where it isn't obvious if you will lose conduct or not.

===Disallowed actions===
* You lose conduct if you apply a [[drum of earthquake]] or [[wand of digging]], and monsters die falling into holes right under them as the [[pit]]s are created.
* Displacing your pet onto a trap and killing it breaks conduct ''only'' if the trap was known.
** The exception is the [[boulder trap]], which only breaks the conduct if it was ''not'' known; this is a bug.{{refsrc|mthrowu.c|218}}
* Similarly; displacing a pet into water or lava while you are levitating or flying.
* Monsters caught in [[scroll of stinking cloud|stinking clouds]] get angry at the hero even if he did not create the cloud (which is possible in [[bones]] files). If the bones were left in an old, pre-3.4.1 version, you lose pacifist as well.
* Reflecting [[Medusa]]'s gaze if it kills her.
* Causing a system shock on a monster from a failed polymorph. Beware trying to use a wand of polymorph to make a powerful pet.
* Passive attacks are still attacks, and monsters killed from a passive attack while you are polymorphed will still give experience and break the conduct.
* Causing a monster that has engulfed you to be killed by your god's bolt of lightning or disintegration beam breaks the conduct.<ref>[[pray.c#473]]</ref>
* "Killing" a monster that is [[Amulet of life saving|life saved]] will still break the conduct. The same applies for monsters that have polymorphed into another form and revert back upon "death". The only exception is a pet that chokes to death on a [[leash]], but is life saved.{{refsrc|apply.c|574}}

===Allowed actions===
* Having a [[pet]] kill a monster. This is the main method for killing monsters as a pacifist.
* [[Genocide]].
* Monsters dying from pits you dug (except pits you opened under them by [[apply]]ing a [[drum of earthquake]] or [[wand of digging]]). Peaceful monsters that don't die will be angered, however.
* [[magic whistle|Whistling]] a pet onto a trap that kills it.
* [[Kick]]ing a monster on top of a trap, as long as it survives your kick and then dies to the trap.
* In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], having monsters drown in the moat created by the [[invocation ritual]] or in pools created by a [[fountain]].
* Having a monster move into water or lava and die while engulfing you.
* Having a pet or [[follower]] vanish because there was no available square on your new dungeon level. (Beware: the game can crash if the follower has a unique item!)
* Killing a monster by reflecting its wand or breath attack.

==Pacifist strategy==
The beginning of a ''NetHack'' game is widely considered to be the hardest phase of the game. On top of that, the pacifist conduct is one of the more difficult conducts in ''NetHack''. Hence, pacifist characters are especially sensitive to starting conditions, and any advantages available at the start of the game are of greater importance than usual.

One critical source of initial advantage is your starting choice of [[race]] and [[role]]. The majority of pacifist ascensions on [[NAO]] have been accomplished with [[Wizard]]s, followed by [[gnome (starting race)|gnomish]] [[Healer]]s. This is because Wizards are good for multi-conduct games, and both enjoy several key benefits at the start of the game. For gnomish Healers these include [[potion of healing]], spells of {{+ of|healing|and=1|stone to flesh}}, [[infravision]], and the large proportion of [[peaceful]] monsters in the [[Gnomish Mines]].

The typical course of a pacifist game is as follows. For much of this section, it is assumed that you are a gnomish Healer, although other scenarios are discussed from time to time.

===Starting out===
For gnomish Healers, especially aspiring pacifists, the [[protection racket]] is the best starting strategy. To avoid an early death, you should raise your maximum [[hit points]] as soon as possible. The easiest way, if you are a Healer, is to quaff the potions of {{! of|healing|and=1|extra healing}} in your starting inventory. Before doing this, however, you may want to [[pray]] to your god first, since praying can increase your maximum hit points. Praying at [[experience level]] 1 will not increase your maximum hit points if you already have more than 15 max HP, which is why it is important to pray before quaffing healing potions.

If you do decide to pray first, wait until 100 turns have elapsed, and then throw items upwards {{kbd|<}} repeatedly until you are at 5 HP or below. (Don't kick walls if there are sleeping [[nymph]]s or [[zoo]] monsters on the level.) Praying under these conditions will maximize the chances of gaining hit points.

It is tempting as a Healer to save the healing potions for emergency use, but this is a mistake. Increasing your hit points is much more useful, and your {{+ of|healing}} spell is usually adequate in emergencies.

[[Nutrition]] may be a problem for players who are not accustomed to relying on their pets. Since you are dependent on your pet for survival, you will need to spend time luring or herding your pet in the direction that you want to go, and this extra time contributes to hunger. See [[Nutrition#strategy|Nutrition §&nbsp;Strategy]] for some hints on how to stay healthy. In particular, if you are having problems with nutrition, try to save your [[prayer]]s for emergency situations when you are weak or fainting from hunger. Healers start with the {{+ of|stone to flesh}} spell and should use this spell as a food source as soon as enough experience levels are gained to cast it (see below).

===Protection racket===
As indicated above, most gnomish Healers should make the [[protection racket]] their first priority. Most of the monsters in the [[Gnomish Mines]] will be peaceful, and with [[infravision]] even the darkened mines levels are survivable. A gnomish Healer with 25&ndash;30 HP and a medium-sized [[dog]] or [[cat]] should have no trouble getting to [[Minetown]].

Healers start with a large amount of [[gold]], often enough that the protection racket can be accomplished without additional gold. However, additional gold is helpful, because even an XL1 character might need up to 3200 gold pieces to buy 9 points of [[protection]]. Also, 600 gold pieces will be needed to [[#Leveling up|level up]] at the [[Oracle]]. The best way to get more gold is by [[credit cloning]] or having your pet steal back expensive items after you sell them.

===Leveling up===
After the protection racket, the next goal for a pacifist gnomish Healer is to get to the [[Oracle]] with sufficient gold.  By buying a major consultation and a minor consultation (in that order), a level 1 character can reach [[experience level]] 3. This will allow you to cast {{+ of|stone to flesh}} to turn [[boulder]]s into [[huge chunks of meat]], which represent a plentiful source of food. A level 1 character can even reach experience level 4 by reading a [[novel]] before getting the major consultation.

If your starting [[power]] level is less than 5, you may wish to gain a level or two at the [[Oracle]] even before performing the [[protection racket]], to enable you to cast healing spells. Each additional level means a longer period of time before you can purchase the last few points of protection; balance this against the benefits of level gain in your situation.

===Mid-game===
Eventually, even at XL1, you will reach a point in the dungeon where the random monsters are too strong for domestic pets to handle. Standard strategies such as [[Elbereth]] can help to protect you, but after a while you will still need to upgrade your pet(s) in order to get any further. A little bit of luck is required here, as not every game will provide the resources you need. (Pacifists don't get [[death drop]]s.)

If you get a [[wish]] early in the game, you should wish for a blessed [[figurine]] of an [[Archon]] (after making sure you can [[charging|recharge]] your wand, if the wish is from a [[wand of wishing]]). This will make the rest of the game much easier. One possible [[metastrategy]] is to play a large number of characters until one of them gets an early wish&mdash;most likely from quaffing at all available [[fountain]]s.

Barring an early wish, a [[polymorph trap]] is a good way to improve your pets. If you hunt for one, the lower mines levels are probably the best (and safest). Each eligible level has a 54% chance of at least one. You need either [[magic resistance]], an [[amulet of unchanging]], a [[leash]], or a [[magic whistle]] in order to polymorph your pets effectively. If you can't find a polymorph trap, try to find a [[spellbook of charm monster]] or [[scroll of taming]], which will let you produce new pets. If you encounter [[chameleon]]s, you can have your pets eat the corpses in order to (potentially) turn into something better. [[reverse genocide|Reverse genociding]] chameleons, though possible, is risky and not generally recommended unless nothing else is available. As a last resort, you can smash a [[potion of polymorph]] or zap a [[wand of polymorph]] on your pet(s), but this has a chance of killing the pet and breaking pacifist conduct. A wand of polymorph is often best saved for [[polypiling]] rather than used on your pets.

A carefully played pacifist character with a pet Archon or the ability to cast charm monster should find that, aside from the few [[#Specific problems and solutions|specific problems]] which are listed below, the [[Castle]] and [[Gehennom]] levels are no harder than they would otherwise be with a regular, non-pacifist character. Whistling your pet into the castle (at the towers) will net you a lot more scrolls and potions than a more direct approach, without any risk to your character. A [[leash]] or [[magic whistle]] are very helpful, and if you make it through the [[Castle]] without one, consider wishing or polypiling for a magic whistle.

===Ascension run===
Pacifist players who have made it to the [[Wizard's tower]] usually employ one of the following two strategies to deal with the [[Wizard of Yendor]] and the various monsters in the endgame: either have a well-equipped pet [[Archon]] on a [[leash]], or a posse of pet [[purple worm]]s on hand.

The [[Wizard of Yendor]] starts out as a level 30 monster, and increases by one level each time he reappears. A pet Archon will reach level 28 without help, but after that you will need to give it potions of gain level to raise its level. The Archon will not attack the Wizard unless the Wizard is no more than one level higher than the Archon, so plan accordingly.  If your Archon is not already high level (mid 30s), you may want to save up several wishes so that you can wish for potions of gain level if needed. Another possibility is to use a level-draining artifact (such as [[the Staff of Aesculapius]]) to lower the Wizard's level, but take care not to kill the Wizard in the process (check with a [[stethoscope]]).

A pet [[purple worm]] can [[instakill]] most monsters by eating them, but they will usually never reach high enough level to attack the Wizard of Yendor without conflict. If you rely on purple worms, a [[ring of conflict]] is essential.  (Conflict also works with pet Archons, but it is risky until they reach level 25, because the Archons might start attacking you.) Another possibility with a purple worm is to have them chow down on the many [[wraith]]s in the [[Valley of the Dead]], as a purple worm will gain a level from each wraith, and this level gain will bypass their normal maximum. However, pet worms usually don't last very long&mdash;they are extremely vulnerable to shapeshifters, green slime, huge monsters, and players annoyed of waiting for them to eat.

A high-level pet Archon with reflection and good weapons and armor (e.g. +7 [[Frost Brand]], [[AC]] &minus;25) will quickly kill pretty much every monster you encounter, even in the endgame, except for [[footrice]]s and monsters with [[digestion]] attacks. Using a [[leash]] or two is highly recommended, especially in the [[Elemental Planes]], since otherwise you will be in bad shape if you enter one of the portals without your pets.

==Specific problems and solutions==

===Team gecko===
Weak monsters such as [[gecko]]s can die if you accidentally hit them. This causes you to lose pacifist conduct and represents a major threat to any would-be pacifist. Players should prepare themselves for a lot of frustration. At the start of the game, there is nothing you can do except play very carefully, using movement commands which do not attack, such as {{kbd|m}}, {{kbd|g}}, capital vi movement keys, and {{kbd|_}}. Once you get a [[cream pie]], you can [[wield]] it.  A character wielding a cream pie does no damage upon hitting a monster, regardless of any damage bonuses you may have.  However, if you hit anything, the cream pie will splat. Feel free to wield a whole stack; only one will splat.

If you have a pet that can kill [[Keystone Kops]], you can find a suitable [[shop]] and steal a [[gold piece]] several times to build up a stockpile of [[cream pie]]s. Dig a pit in front of his door to keep the [[shopkeeper]] inside. If he approaches you after you rob the shop, you can [[pay]] the shopkeeper to appease him.

If you don't have a cream pie, wielding a very weak weapon (a [[Puddingbane]]) will make sure the damage is limited to 1 even if you have a damage bonus from [[ring of increase damage|rings]] or strength. Do not use a non-weapon object unless your [[strength]] is 15 or lower, otherwise the damage will be increased by your strength bonus. However, even a single point of accidental damage can still kill weak monsters.

More drastic solutions include [[Genocide|genociding]] bump-kill candidates (if you have excess scrolls), or [[Pacifist/screen|remapping the movement keys]] to safe alternatives.

===Weapon considerations===
On rare occasions, it is helpful for a pacifist to use weapons to attack monsters. If you have a [[stethoscope]], you can selectively reduce monsters to very few hit points or even one hit point using a weak weapon or non-weapon such as a [[Puddingbane]]. This helps your pet kill [[floating eye]]s if you have a [[blindfold]]. Later, once you get a [[Drain life|level-draining]] artifact, you can use it to drain high level monsters to the point where your pet will attack it.

===Gaining experience===
Here is a full list of pacifist methods for gaining experience:
* Quaffing [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]]
* Eating [[wraith]] corpses
* Lying with [[foocubi]]
* Talking with the [[Oracle]]
* Eating [[tripe ration]]s
* Quaffing from [[sink]]s
* Untrapping [[squeaky board]]s
* Reading a [[novel]] (first time only)
* [[Polymorph]]ing into your own [[race]] (but equally likely to lose a level)

[[Potion of gain level|Potions of gain level]] are usually best saved for a pet Archon. [[Chat]]ting with the [[Oracle]] is useful in the early game, but only works once per game. This leaves eating [[wraith]] corpses and consorting with [[foocubi]] as the primary level-up methods for a pacifist. Wraiths can be [[reverse genocide]]d or lured from a [[graveyard]] level such as the [[Valley of the Dead]] (use [[level teleport]] for maximum speed, or [[charm monster]]).  Tripe rations are a handy way to regain levels lost to [[level drain]].

If you run across any wraith corpses in the dungeon, you should eat them, as it will make it easier to enter the [[Quest]] later on. However, unless there is some need to gain levels (for example, to cast {{spell of|charm monster}}), you should not bother actively gaining experience until necessary for the [[Quest]], in order to keep the difficulty of random monsters low.

Most of the time, gaining levels is not a big challenge compared with all of the other difficulties of pacifism, and in general if you are opportunistic with [[wraith]] corpses and [[foocubi]] summoning via [[sink]]s you should have no trouble.  However, if your game is lacking in sinks and wraiths, you may have to take matters into your own hands.  Perhaps the easiest solution is to [[polypile]] or [[wish]] for a [[magic marker]] and [[reverse genocide]] wraiths.  Other methods include letting [[water demon]]s hit you to summon [[foocubi]], [[Farming#Throne farming|farming]] for potions to [[Alchemy|alchemize]] by repeatedly #looting a throne (note changes between versions in this), or [[Farming#Wraith farming|wraith farming]] with the [[Book of the Dead]].

===Gaining alignment===
In order to fully take advantage of what your god can do for you (fix problems) you'll need to have an [[alignment record]] greater than zero. If your role starts the game with zero alignment record, it should be raised before you run into your first major trouble.  Also, it must be 20 for you to be allowed on the [[quest]].

With [[Healer]]s or [[lawful]] characters, your alignment can be easily raised by healing your pets; you get one alignment point each time you heal them.

[[Chaotic]] characters gain one point of alignment each time they sleep with a [[foocubus]], which is also a good way to gain experience.

With [[neutral]] characters, it is a bit more difficult. The easiest technique to get the first couple of points of alignment is to pray after the 300th turn with a [[minor trouble]], since your initial [[prayer timeout]] is set to 300. This will only work for the first two points of alignment. 

After that, you can get more alignment by giving gold to [[aligned priest]]s. Giving a priest of your alignment (hope for a co-aligned Minetown altar) 600 times your level in gold will raise your alignment two points, but only if you don't have more than 2 times that amount of gold in your inventory at the time. So stash away all the gold you're not giving to the priest in a bag, then give to charity!

You can get a slightly better deal once you've bought the first 9 points of protection from that co-aligned priest. After that, if you spend 400 times your level in gold, you have only a small chance of getting more protection; you will usually get the alignment bonus instead (assuming the amount is more than half your current gold).

[[unicorn|Sacrificing unicorns]] of other alignments is probably the next-easiest way to raise your alignment as a neutral character.

Neutral atheist non-Healer pacifists have an especially hard time raising their alignment.  The only method available to them is to anger a cross-aligned priest. Ben Hiles has ascended an [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/9aaa937386570454/59400e18fbd6250a?lnk=st&q=&rnum=1#59400e18fbd6250a atheist pacifist Gnomish Wizard] this way.

In [[3.4.3]] and earlier, a [[helm of opposite alignment]] could be used to open up other deities' methods of gaining alignment, such as casting healing spells on pets; unfortunately, as of [[3.6.0]], putting on or removing the helm resets your alignment to zero, making the practice pointless.

===Engulfing monsters===
{{main|Engulfing}}

If a monster [[engulfing|engulfs]] you, [[apply]]ing a [[tooled horn]] will cause the monster to expel you. Pacifists should thus make it a priority to find a tooled horn. Other escape methods such as [[teleportation]], [[ring of slow digestion]], [[wand of slow monster]], [[wand of opening]], [[cloak of displacement]], [[wand of digging]], and the {{+ of|knock|and=1|slow monster}} spells can also be used in various situations. An engulfer without a digestion attack will eventually spit you out if you survive.{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1801}}{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1689}}

[[Air elemental]]s are dangerous opponents, since they are fast and often re-engulf you immediately after you escape. On a no-teleport level, zapping the air elemental with a wand of teleportation will move it out of your way. On levels that permit teleportation, you must zap yourself and not the air elemental in order to teleport outside of the monster.

Pets cannot be engulfed except by monsters with [[digestion]] attacks; however, a pet which is engulfed by a digestion attack suffers [[instadeath]]. Fortunately, the only monsters with digestion attacks are [[trapper]]s, [[lurkers above]], and [[purple worm]]s. All three of them move slowly if at all, so they are easy to avoid if you have [[telepathy]] or (to a lesser extent) [[warning]]. Another option, if you don't intend to have any pet [[purple worm]]s, is to [[genocide]] them.

===Cockatrices===
Most pets will not attack cockatrices. If you are unable to obtain a stoning-resistant pet such as a [[yellow dragon]] or a [[gargoyle]], cockatrices will be very annoying obstacles. Taming, teleportation, genocide, conflict, and luring a wounded cockatrice into a pit are about the only ways to get rid of them without a pet that is willing to attack them. The easiest solution is to simply genocide them. In a normal game, genociding cockatrices is usually not a good idea, as their corpses are immensely useful against certain difficult enemies. This is not true in a pacifist game, as your pets will not wield cockatrice corpses if they have an artifact or no gloves, and the conduct keeps you from using it yourself. Additionally, any cockatrice corpses left on the ground could potentially be wielded against you by a [[soldier]] wearing gloves. The only potential uses for cockatrices in a pacifist game are with conflict, and deliberately stoning a weak pet [[golem]] to get a stronger stone golem.

===High level monsters===
A [[ring of conflict]] will cause your pets to attack other monsters (and you) regardless of any differences in monster level. If you don't have conflict, you will have to spend some effort to raise your pets' levels, since without conflict a pet will not attack monsters more than one level higher than it. Another option is to turn the monster into a [[green slime]] and either have a pet kill it or simply run away. It is possible to slime the Wizard of Yendor and polymorph into a nymph to steal the Book of the Dead. This has the added advantage of the Wizard not reappearing until after performing the invocation ritual.

A pet [[Archon]] will reach level 28 without any special effort. After that, the only way to raise its level is to give it [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]]. Of the monsters normally encountered in the game, only [[Asmodeus]], [[Baalzebub]], [[Orcus]], the [[Wizard of Yendor]], and the [[Riders]] are above level 29. It is usually best to bribe [[Asmodeus]] and [[Baalzebub]], since otherwise they are fairly hard to kill. Asmodeus, in particular, is level 49, which is very difficult to handle without conflict. [[Orcus]] is level 30 and thus requires a level 29 Archon to kill&mdash;give your Archon one potion of gain level. The [[Riders]] have a base level of 30, but their actual level will be between 33 and 37, depending on your level and the depth of the Sanctum.

The [[Wizard of Yendor]] starts at level 30, but each death of the Wizard or his [[double trouble|clones]] increases the level of his next appearance by one.{{refsrc|makemon.c|1367}} For this reason, it is a good idea to ensure that your Archon is several experience levels higher than the Wizard before beginning the ascension run, or have a level draining artifact on hand to use against him (check his level and hit points periodically with a stethoscope to make sure you don't kill him). As usual, if the level draining artifact is your [[quest artifact]], be prepared as it will eventually be stolen by the Wizard if left out long enough. The most convenient source of [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]] is probably #looting the [[throne]] in [[Vlad's Tower]] repeatedly&mdash;about 2&ndash;4% of all monsters generated will carry such a potion.

Another option is to tame [[lich]]es and grow them into arch-liches; a fully leveled arch-lich is level 37, sufficient to attack the Wizard for several incarnations. Arch-liches have the additional advantage of being covetous; once wounded both the Wizard and the tame lich will teleport to the upstairs (if it exists) and will continue to fight. Monsters will not escape upstairs or cast healing spells if you are not nearby, so the two will continue to fight until one of them dies&mdash;typically the Wizard, as an arch-lich has more damaging attacks. An arch-lich specifically wants the Book of the Dead and will therefore pick it up after the Wizard dies, but it may be difficult to get the Book back; the lich will still drop carried items due to being tame, but tends to immediately pick the Book up again.

Without a large supply of potions of gain level, it is always possible that the Wizard will reach a point where a pet Archon will refuse to attack him without conflict. The easiest way to get a level 49 pet is to tame a purple worm and [[Farming#wraith_farming|farm for wraiths]] with the cursed Book of the Dead. Purple worms will gain a level whenever they swallow a wraith, ignoring corpse dropping odds. Beware the by-product arch-liches, and that the Wizard will haunt you unless you steal the book without killing him. Once at level 49, the pet worm will always be able to quickly kill the Wizard and will have enough HP to survive most combat. You still need to keep it away from disintegration blasts, polymorph traps, shapeshifters, and the Riders.

===Traps===
Certain traps are dangerous for pacifists. A [[polymorph trap]] can turn a strong pet into a weak pet. [[Level teleporter]]s and [[trap door]]s can separate you from your pet. If you have a [[Trap#Strategy|trap detection]] method, it might be a good idea to search each level for dangerous traps and disable them, or keep your pets away. In most cases, it is enough to put a cursed object or a boulder on the trap, or to dig a [[pit]].

In the main dungeon, most traps can be avoided by walking in corridors instead of rooms. [[Digging]] your own corridors is a relatively safe method of travel, but tedious and usually not necessary. In [[Gehennom]], try to stay in front of your pet at all times by using the layout of the maze to block your pet from walking in front of you. This will ensure that you encounter dangerous traps before your pet steps into them; once you find a dangerous trap, you should disable it immediately. Be aware, however, that when dangerous monsters are in the vicinity, you will want to keep your pet in front of you instead, so switch between the two modes of exploration as appropriate. [[Extrinsic telepathy]] is extremely valuable here, as is [[magic mapping]].

Because you could lose your pet at any time to a trap, it is important for a pacifist to have at least two pets (if not more). A diversity of pets can handle a diversity of challenges.

===Water and lava===
Most pets, except for flying pets and a few that can survive under water, will die if you displace them into [[moat|water]] or [[lava]]. If they die in this way, you will lose pacifist conduct. Be especially careful with pets on levels with water or lava. If you are not able to play with the necessary amount of caution, one alternative is to make sure all your pets can fly (and abandon the ones that can't).

In 3.6, if you drown a monster by creating a [[pool]] under it, either by digging a [[fountain]] or by doing the [[invocation]], it breaks the conduct, so it is desirable to check for nearby monsters.

===Monsters with special abilities===
Many special abilities, such as [[mind flayer]]s' brain-sucking attack and [[touch of death]], won't work on your pet.  Major exceptions include a [[cockatrice]]'s stoning attack or a [[black dragon]]'s breath attack, which can kill your pet instantly. Pets will not attack a footrice unless they are stoning resistant or you are causing [[conflict]]. The way to deal with cockatrices is to have a stoning resistant pet, [[teleport]] them, [[tame]] them, [[cancel]] them, or use [[genocide]]. Stoned pets may be recovered by the {{+ of|stone to flesh}} spell.

[[Black dragon]]s are best handled by giving your pets [[reflection]], or using [[cancellation]] or [[genocide]].

A [[floating eye]]'s gaze attack will affect pets. Keep any pets without [[reflection]] away from floating eyes until you obtain an [[expensive camera]], [[wand of make invisible]], or some other means of neutralizing their gaze attack. You can wake pets up with a [[leather drum]], a [[tooled horn]], or a depleted [[drum of earthquake]] or magical horn.

[[Medusa]] is another special case. If you [[reflection|reflect]] Medusa's gaze, you will lose pacifist conduct, so don't do that. Standard techniques for dispatching Medusa include using a pet with reflection, [[cancel]]ling or blinding Medusa, or blindfolding yourself and dropping a [[wand of death]] in her path for her to use.

===Wishing===
Before [[wish]]ing for an [[artifact]], make sure that you can survive its [[artifact blast]]. Good artifact wishes for a pacifist include the following:

* [[The Eye of the Aethiopica]]
** Allows you to cast healing spells more frequently, if you are a Healer.
** [[Telepathy]] helps you avoid hitting monsters.
** [[Magic resistance]] is very helpful when polymorphing pets in polymorph traps.
** [[Branchport]]ing is useful for [[wraith]] luring.
* [[The Orb of Fate]]
** Confers half damage, which helps you survive.
** The [[crystal ball]] function lets you look for dangerous traps. Recharge using [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]] for even greater effect.
** Level teleport is handy for [[wraith]] luring.
* [[The Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]
** Pacifists rely on [[wand]]s more than usual, especially wands of {{wand of|fire|and=1|lightning}}, which can engrave [[Elbereth]], and [[wand of teleportation|wands of teleportation]], which can move monsters out of the way. Being able to recharge wands is good.
** Also confers telepathy and magic resistance.
** Allows unlimited use of the Orb of Fate to search for traps. (A regular [[crystal ball]] will also work, but unless your [[intelligence]] is at least 20, a regular crystal ball has a chance of exploding when used.)
* If you're not a Healer, a [[level drain]]ing artifact may be worth a wish.

Useful non-artifact wishes include the usual [[ascension kit]] equipment, plus any of the following depending on your situation:

* blessed figurine of an Archon
* blessed spellbook of charm monster
* blessed magic whistle
* blessed ring of conflict

===No death drops===
Pacifists get less loot, and what they do get is much less useful. Random items are generated only during initial level generation or as [[death drop]]s which break the conduct. Monsters are created only with a very narrow [[Monster starting inventory|selection of items]]. [[Polypiling]], [[wish]]ing, [[magic marker|writing books and scrolls]], divine gifts, and [[alchemy]] offer a way out, but all of these (except alchemy) break other [[conduct]]s. On the flip side, you can identify items by that monsters were created with them, particularly when this varies by monster.

==Pacifist ascensions==
Pacifist [[Healer]]s and [[Wizard]]s are common, but a few other classes have been ascended as pacifists:

* [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/2f82d79910f8d914 A pacifist Archeologist] by [[Marvin]]
* [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/d407fabb048f84e4 A pacifist Rogue] by Marvin
* [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/f5a3e2ac50847dfa A pacifist Monk] (and 8 other conducts too) by Brad Sagarin

No [[YAPAP]]s have been posted to [[RGRN]] for a Barbarian, Caveman, Knight, Ranger, Priest, Samurai, Tourist, or Valkyrie.

On [[NAO]], there have been 14 Healer, 12 Wizard, 3 Monk, 2 Tourist, and 1 each of Archaeologist, Barbarian, Caveman, Rogue, Priest, Knight, and Valkyrie ascensions.<ref>!lg * won conduct=pacifist gmax=role, query to the Rodney bot on 2-2-2012</ref>.

Pacifism is the most difficult conduct; only 0.8% of all winning NAO accounts have a pacifist ascension.<ref>!lg -count * won turns>0 g=name and !lg -count * won turns>0 g=name conduct=pacifist</ref>

==Variants==
All variants track Pacifist normally, but some have changes that make the conduct less frustrating and error-prone:

===FIQHack===
[[Weapon-tool]]s always display "You begin bashing" when attacking unskilled with the tool; this helps the player realize their mistake if they accidentally attack with a pickaxe and it doesn't kill the monster.

===XNetHack===
If the player has not attacked any monsters after 100 turns have passed, they are prompted to confirm any melee attack. Once they confirm an attack, or kill a monster, the prompt no longer appears.

A major part of [[NetHack]] is [[identify]]ing items. To make this more difficult, the appearances of [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, [[ring]]s, [[amulet]]s, [[wand]]s, [[spellbook]]s, and some [[armor]] are randomly shuffled at game start. This page lists the possible '''randomized appearances''' - each object has a "default" starting appearance prior to being shuffled, listed next to it in <code>src/objects.c</code> (as can be seen in the [[Source:NetHack 3.6.1/src/objects.c|source code on-wiki]]).

In some cases, an item's appearance affects its function beyond its identified type.

==Scrolls==
Scrolls of [[scroll of mail|mail]] and [[scroll of blank paper|blank paper]] are the only ones that have fixed appearances.{{refsrc|src/objects.c|877|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} All others may appear as one of the following, which are shuffled into use at the start of a game:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|849|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    XOR OTA

For the meanings and origins of some of these names, see [[scroll origins]].

==Potions==
A [[potion of water]] is always a "clear potion".{{refsrc|src/objects.c|818|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Other [[potions]] have one of these descriptions:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|788|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    ruby        pink        orange        yellow          emerald
    dark green  cyan        sky blue      brilliant blue  magenta
    purple-red  puce        milky         swirly          bubbly
    smoky       cloudy      effervescent  black           golden
    brown       fizzy       dark          white           murky

Of these, the [[smoky potion]] and [[milky potion]] are special in all games regardless of their actual identity. A smoky potion may contain a [[djinni]], and a milky potion may contain a [[ghost]].

==Spellbooks==
The [[Book of the Dead]], [[novel]]s and [[blank spellbook]]s all have a fixed description.{{refsrc|src/objects.c|999|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} The cover of a regular [[spellbook]] will appear as one of the following:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|899|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    parchment    vellum       ragged       dog eared    mottled
    stained      cloth        leather      white        pink
    red          orange       yellow       velvet       light green
    dark green   turquoise    cyan         light blue   dark blue
    indigo       magenta      purple       violet       tan
    plaid        light brown  dark brown   gray         wrinkled
    dusty        bronze       copper       silver       gold
    glittering   shining      dull         thin         thick

The '''dull spellbook''' may cause the player to fall [[asleep]] when reading it. '''Vellum''' and '''parchment spellbooks''' have pages made of [[leather]], rather than [[paper]] as all the others are, and will break [[vegetarian]] conduct if eaten.{{refsrc|src/objects.c|907|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/objects.c|909|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

The source code also contains appearances for the [[deferred feature|deferred]] spellbooks of {{spell of|flame sphere}} and {{spell of|freeze sphere}}, which are ''canvas'' and ''hardcover'' respectively.{{refsrc|src/objects.c|991|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} These will presumably be randomized if the spellbooks are enabled.

==Rings==
[[Rings]] other than the [[meat ring]] will randomly take one of the following appearances:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|536|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    pearl       iron        twisted     steel       wire
    engagement  shiny       bronze      brass       copper
    silver      gold        wooden      granite     opal
    clay        coral       black onyx  moonstone   tiger eye
    jade        agate       topaz       sapphire    ruby
    diamond     ivory       emerald

Of these, topaz, sapphire, ruby, steel, diamond and emerald rings can be used to semi-permanently [[engrave]] something on the floor.

If you are wearing a [[silver]] ring and are not wearing gloves, you will do extra damage to silver-hating monsters with bare-handed and martial arts attacks.{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|712|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

The appearance of rings determines what monsters can eat them, and also influences golem creation when [[polypiling]]. The former is especially important, as [[Eating jewelry|you can sometimes gain intrinsics]] from eating rings while you are polymorphed. Pearl, iron, twisted, steel, wire, engagement, and shiny rings can be eaten by any [[metallivore]] ([[rock mole]], [[xorn]], or [[rust monster]]). Bronze, brass, copper, silver, and gold can be eaten by any metallivore not restricted to rustable metals (rock mole and xorn). Additionally, [[gelatinous cube]]s can eat wooden rings.

==Amulets==
[[Amulet]]s other than the [[Amulet of Yendor]] and [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor|its imitation]] have the following appearances:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|604|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/objects.c|618|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    circular    spherical   oval
    triangular  pyramidal   square
    concave     hexagonal   octagonal

Except for the Amulet of Yendor and its imitation, they can all be eaten by [[metallivore]]s. You have a chance of gaining intrinsics from eating amulets while polymorphed.

==Wands==
[[Wand]]s take one of the following appearances:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|1012|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    aluminum    balsa       brass       copper      crystal
    curved      ebony       forked      glass       hexagonal
    iridium     iron        jeweled     long        maple
    marble      oak         pine        platinum    runed
    short       silver      spiked      steel       tin
    uranium     zinc

Glass and crystal wands are [[fragile]] and can break - this is significant in some cases, especially if you kick the chest that stores the [[wand of wishing]] in the [[castle]]. The appearance of wands also determines what monsters can eat them, and also influences golem creation when polypiling. Eating a wand while polymorphed has no effect besides nutrition, however. Balsa wands require only 5 [[strength]] to break, while other wands require 10.

==Armor==
The material of armor is determined by its type, not by its appearance. This is significant for gloves and boots: [[gauntlets of power]] and [[kicking boots]] are iron, the rest are leather. Some appearances have additional effects.

===Helms===
Four [[helm]]s are randomized: the [[helmet]], [[helm of brilliance]], [[helm of opposite alignment]], and [[helm of telepathy]]. Each has one of the following randomized appearances:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|355|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    plumed helmet      etched helmet      crested helmet      visored helmet

Of these, the '''visored helmet''' is always special. It protects against the [[blind]]ing attack of [[raven]]s and the [[venom]]-spitting attack of [[cobra]]s.

===Cloaks===
Four [[cloak]]s have random appearances: the [[cloak of displacement]], [[cloak of invisibility]], [[cloak of magic resistance]] and [[cloak of protection]]. They are chosen from the following:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|464|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    tattered cape      ornamental cope      opera cloak      piece of cloth

[[cloak of displacement|Cloaks of displacement]] and a [[cloak of protection]] of any AC will [[auto-identify]] themselves when worn, as will [[cloak of invisibility|cloaks of invisibility]] unless you are already [[invisible]]. Otherwise, a worn cloak that does not auto-identify is the [[cloak of magic resistance]].

===Gloves===
The appearances of all [[gloves]] are randomized:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|493|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    old gloves      padded gloves      riding gloves      fencing gloves

Of these, the '''riding gloves''' are special, increasing the chance of successfully [[saddle|saddling]] a steed.

===Boots===
The appearance of the magical '''[[boots]]''' is randomized from the following set:{{refsrc|src/objects.c|513|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

    mud boots      snow boots      riding boots    buckled boots
    hiking boots   combat boots    jungle boots

Of these, '''snow boots''' and '''riding boots''' are special. The former prevents the [[fumbling]] effect of [[ice]] and the latter increases the chance of successfully saddling a steed. However, this bonus is not cumulative with the riding gloves.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the dull spellbook's reading effect ignored [[sleep resistance]], which was bug [[Bugs in NetHack 3.6.0#360-15|C360-15]].

The change to vellum and parchment spellbooks that make them leather was added in [[Nethack 3.6.2]].

==SLASH'EM==
{{main|Item (SLASH'EM)#New randomized appearances}}
[[SLASH'EM]] adds several new items, with accompanying item appearances (including randomized ones) to match.

The cloak that happens to have the randomized appearance "opera cloak" will appear much more often than its base type's frequency suggests, because many [[vampire]]s will be generated with one. At least in the case of cloaks of invisibility and magic resistance, it also means many vampires will be invisible or magic resistant.

The '''magic trap''' is a [[trap]] with many possible magical effects. Having [[magic resistance]] will '''not''' protect you from these traps.

== Generation ==

Though magic traps can be randomly generated on any level in the dungeon, certain special levels have some guaranteed ones. The [[Knight quest]] has 45 guaranteed magic traps; the lair of [[Asmodeus]] has three; the [[Valley of the Dead]], the [[Wizard of Yendor]]'s Tower, and the lairs of [[Juiblex]], [[Orcus]], and [[Baalzebub]] have two each; one variant of [[Medusa]]'s lair, the [[Sanctum]], the [[Archeologist quest]], and the [[Wizard quest]] have one each.

== Effects of magic traps ==

The effects of magic traps are as follows{{refsrc|trap.c|3045|nethack=3.6.0}}:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Probability !! Effect
|-
| 20/600 (3.3%) || Magical explosion
|-
| 261/600 (43.5%) || Creates 1-4 monsters around the trap, blinds you, and deafens you.
|-
| 58/600 (9.7%) || No message or effect, but the trap is still marked.
|-
| 29/600 (4.8%) || Same effect as [[Trap#Fire trap|fire trap]], a tower of flame that deals damage and burns inventory.
|-
| 29/600 (4.8%) each || Six different "odd feeling" messages with no effect.
|-
| 29/600 (4.8%) || Charisma increase, tame adjacent monsters.
|-
| 29/600 (4.8%) || Uncurse worn and wielded items and loadstones.
|}

Monsters are much less likely to trigger magic traps than players. There is a 1 in 21 chance that they will experience the fire trap effect, and otherwise experience no effect at all.{{refsrc|trap.c|2531|nethack=3.6.0}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Magic traps can be removed by zapping them with the spell or wand of cancellation. The trap will explode for 23 to 38 damage.
Magic traps also have an effect that toggles intrinsic invisibility. If you are not invisible, you become invisible; if you are invisible, you lose this ability }}

== Messages ==
{{message|You are caught in a magical explosion! Your body absorbs some of the magical energy!|Magical explosion effect: trap is destroyed, you take 1d10 damage, maximum Pw increased by 2, current Pw brought to maximum{{refsrc|trap.c|1305|nethack=3.6.0}}.}}
{{message|You are momentarily blinded by a flash of light!|Create monster effect when you are not blind; you are now blinded for 1d5 + 10 turns.}}
{{message|You see a flash of light!|Create monster effect when you are not blind but resist blindness (e.g. by wielding [[Sunsword]]).}}
{{message|You hear a deafening roar!|Create monster effect when you are not deaf; you are now deafened for 1d20 + 30 turns.}}
{{message|You feel rankled.|Create monster effect when you are already deaf; deafness is extended for 1d5 + 15 turns.}}
{{message|A tower of flame erupts from the floor!|Fire trap effect.}}
{{message|You hear distant howling.}}
{{message|You suddenly yearn for your distant homeland.}}
{{message|A shiver runs up and down your spine!}}
{{message|Your pack shakes violently!}}
{{message|You smell charred flesh.}}
{{message|You feel tired.|These are all called "odd feelings" and none of them have any effect.}}
{{message|You suddenly yearn for your nearby homeland.|You happen to be on the level containing the quest portal, or in the quest branch but not on the home level.}}
{{message|You feel [oddly] like the prodigal son.|You would have yearned for your homeland, but you are on the quest home level already. Female characters feel "oddly".}}
{{message|You hear the moon howling at you.}}
{{message|You suddenly yearn for Cleveland.}}
{{message|You smell hamburgers.|You would have had the corresponding odd feeling, but you are [[hallucinating]].}}
{{message|You feel charismatic!|Charisma increases by 1 if not maximum; all adjacent monsters are tamed if they can be, or otherwise made peaceful if they can be. Monster magic resistance is ''not'' checked.}}
{{message|You feel like someone is helping you.|Same effect as an uncursed [[scroll of remove curse]] - curses on worn and wielded items and [[loadstones]] will be removed.}}

== Strategy ==

Repeatedly #[[sit]]ting or stepping on magic traps is an easy way to raise [[charisma]]; a patient player can usually reach the maximum for his [[race]]. This may be useful for dealing with [[foocubi]]. This effect can also be used to acquire pets, especially because the trap tends to create many monsters. On average, a single magic trap grants 1.4 points of charisma.

The remove curse effect of the trap is not as reliable since it requires you to equip cursed gear with no guarantee that you will actually get the curses removed. Still, a player desperate to get rid of cursed gear might try to use a magic trap for this purpose. A cursed item can be wielded without welding to the hand, provided that it is not a [[weapon]], a [[weapon-tool]] or a [[tin opener]], and the remove curse effect will then remove the curse.

If you wish to sit on a trap repeatedly, you should prepare by engraving [[Elbereth]], having [[fire resistance]], and having nothing burnable in your inventory. You should also be ready to deal with the many monsters created by the trap: making yourself immune to blindness with the [[Eyes of the Overworld]] or [[Sunsword]], having [[telepathy]] or [[warning]] and being blind beforehand, having a [[unicorn horn]] to cure [[blind]]ness, or just being confident that you are equipped enough to deal with all the unseen monsters. A unicorn horn is also nice for curing [[deafness]].

The choice of which magic trap to sit on is also important; monsters generated from deeper traps will have a higher average [[difficulty]]. In general, it is a good idea to start with the shallowest dungeon levels and work your way down until you have reached the charisma score you want. If your [[Quest]] branch generates non-threatening monsters, though, you might want to use the magic traps there first.

A magic trap sufficiently close to an [[altar]] may be useful for generating [[sacrifice|sacrifices]].

== Variants ==
=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]] some traps can be created by breaking a wand with a similar name. Breaking a wand of magic missile can create a magic trap if the terrain can accommodate such a trap.
=== SLASH'EM ===
Magic traps are slightly changed in [[SLASH'EM]]. The "Your pack shakes violently!" message now has an associated effect; every object in your inventory has a 1 in 10 chance of being assigned a new random letter. If the newly assigned letter is already taken by another object in the inventory the two items are swapped. Players that use fixinv will instead take 2 damage for each item that would have been moved; if this damage is fatal the death message will be "killed by violence". Additionally, monsters also have a 1 in 30 chance of destroying the magic trap in the same manner as the player; the trap is removed, they take 1d10 damage, their maximum power is increased by 2, and their power is set to this new maximum.

&&%s&& %s Beginner {91209 2014-11-22T20:37:27Z {0 } all "strange feelings" in 3.4.3 {{stub}}
Being a '''beginner''' is a condition of a single [[NetHack]] [[player|character]]. Characters that have never achieved 2000 [[score]] points (1000 if a [[wizard]]) are classified as beginners. It causes otherwise unique messages given by [[scroll]]s, [[spell]]s, and [[potion]]s to default to "You have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes" ("normal feeling" if hallucinating), which hampers their identification.

The following events are affected by this:
* Performing [[gold detection]] when there is no gold on the level
* Performing non-blessed [[food detection]] when there is no food on the level (or blessed when already detecting dangerous food)
* Performing [[object detection]] when there are no objects on the level
* Performing non-blessed [[monster detection]] when there are no monsters on the level
* Attempting to detect traps (with a [[crystal ball]] or cursed/confused [[scroll of gold detection]]) when there are no traps on the level
* Reading a [[scroll of enchant armor]] while not wearing any armor
* Reading a [[scroll of destroy armor]] while not wearing any armor, confused or not
* Reading a [[scroll of enchant weapon]] while not wielding any weapon

This is a condition experienced by all players; each character (regardless of a player's history) is initially a beginner.

&&%s&& %s Potion of hallucination {145177 2022-03-28T02:59:53Z {4001483 Cathartes} no monster confusion;  3.6.6 refsrc and rn1 template {{potion|name=hallucination|cost=100}}

A '''potion of hallucination''' is a type of potion that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. 

==Description==
:''See also: [[Hallucination]]
[[Quaff]]ing the potion causes [[hallucination]], with the duration dependent on the potion's [[beatitude]]: blessed potions cause you to hallucinate for {{rn1|200|300}} turns, uncursed potions cause hallucination for {{rn1|200|600}} turns, and cursed potions cause hallucination for {{rn1|200|900}} turns.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|636|nethack=3.6.6}} Dipping a [[unicorn horn]] into a potion of hallucination turns it into uncursed {{! of|water}}.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|1817|nethack=3.6.6}}

Inhaling [[vapors]] from this potion is harmless, only printing a message and then prompting you to type-[[name]] the potion.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|1697|nethack=3.6.6}}

[[Hallucination resistance]], which is only granted by wielding [[Grayswandir]], suppresses the effects of hallucination instead of blocking or curing it outright.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Drinking a non-cursed potion of hallucination may now give [[enlightenment]]; wielding [[Grayswandir]] also blocks this effect. The chance of gaining enlightenment is 4 in 9 for a blessed potion, and 1 in 6 for an uncursed potion; this also exercises wisdom.}}

==Strategy==
Potions of hallucination tend to have relatively few uses, as there are more reliable ways to confuse hostile monsters, and there are even fewer benefits to quaffing them directly - as such they are generally considered prime candidates for [[dilution]]. However, there is one possible use for a potion outside of this: hallucinating while being hit by a [[touch of death]] prevents it from killing you. This may make a potion of hallucination a life saver against a vicious hostile spellcaster if you have not yet procured [[magic resistance]].

==History==
The potion of hallucination first appears in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

==Messages==
{{message|Oh wow! Everything <looks/feels> so cosmic!|You are hallucinating - "feels" is used if you are also [[blind]] at the time.}}
{{message|You have a momentary vision.|You inhaled vapors from a broken potion of hallucination.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]] and its variants, hallucination also distorts items you are standing on as well as your inventory, which makes randomly quaffing potions far more hazardous; additionally, it is still only a minor problem in the eyes of your [[deity]], so be sure to have the inventory letter of your remedy memorized. In addition to unicorn horns, applying [[medical kit]]s can also cure hallucination.

The potion is also given a less fringe benefit: asking a shopkeeper to [[Shopkeeper services#Uncursing|uncurse an item]] while hallucinating has a chance of [[bless]]ing it instead, providing a means of doing so without breaking [[atheist]] conduct.

The [[Lawful Quest]] has a {{frac|2|5}} chance to generate a cursed potion of hallucination among the objects within the Chamber of Junk.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the potion of hallucination has some additional possible effects: hallucinating while eating a corpse that grants telepathy adds a point of [[insight]], while quaffing a cursed potion of hallucination reduces your insight by one point. As with SLASH'EM, requesting the item-uncursing service while hallucinating may also cause the item to be blessed instead.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], [[intelligent]] monsters can be generated with the potion of hallucination as an [[offensive item]], and will throw them at you if possible.

'''The Eye of the Aethiopica''' is the [[Wizard]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[wizard quest]]. It is [[neutral]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its [[base item]] is an [[amulet of ESP]].

==Effects==
While carried, the Eye provides [[half spell damage]] and fast [[power]] regeneration. While worn, in addition to normal extrinsic [[telepathy]], it further confers [[magic resistance]]. With fast power regeneration, you restore at least one power per turn. You can #[[invoke]] the Eye to '''branchport''', which immediately [[teleport]]s you to another [[dungeon branch]] that you have visited.

===Branchporting===
If the topmost level for the target branch is at or deeper than your current level, then you arrive at the entry level. Otherwise, you arrive at the deepest previously-visited level of the target branch.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1558|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} For example:
* If you port from the quest Home level to [[Sokoban]], Sokoban is between Dlvl:9 and Dlvl:6, and you have visited Sokoban Dlvl:6, you will arrive at Sokoban Dlvl:6. ("Deepest" means topmost for Sokoban and [[Vlad's Tower]].)
* If you are currently on Dlvl:14 in the [[Dungeons of Doom]], [[Mines' End]] is at Dlvl:10, you have visited Mines' End, and you port to the Gnomish Mines, you will arrive at Mines' End.
* If you are currently on Dlvl:2 in the [[Dungeons of Doom]], the Gnomish Mines start at Dlvl:3, and you port to the Gnomish Mines, you will arrive at the entry level on Dlvl:3.
* If the [[Quest]] is on Dlvl:14, you are anywhere between Dlvl:1 and Dlvl:14, and you port to the Quest, you arrive in the Home level.  
* From any other branch to the Dungeons of Doom, you will always go to the deepest previously-visited level.
* From any other branch (except Vlad's Tower) to [[Gehennom]], you will always go to the [[Valley of the Dead]].

Attempting to branchport to the branch you are currently in (or from the [[End Game]] or while carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]]) gives the message "You feel very disoriented for a moment" and has no effect. Adjacent monsters that normally [[follow]] you up stairs will follow you through the gate into the new branch.

A typical branchport menu might look like:
<pre>
                                  Open a portal to which dungeon?
----------
|........-####      ------------- a - The Dungeons of Doom
|........|   #######-...........| b - Gehennom
|........|          |...........| c - The Gnomish Mines
----------          |..@........| d - The Quest
                    --------+---- e - Sokoban
                            #     f - Fort Ludios
                            #     (end)
</pre>

==Strategy==
The fast power regeneration and magic resistance combined with the base item makes the Eye of the Aethiopica a highly sought-after choice of a wish for neutral non-Wizard spellcasters. If you plan to wish for it, take note of the second "the" in its name.

Branchporting using the Eye is a common method to transport [[wraith]]s from the [[Valley of the Dead]], so they are more likely to leave corpses, and it makes [[Sokoban]] a more accessible and ideal [[stash]] location. Since this is at quite a shallow depth, you can usually return quickly by digging down with a pick-axe, or else branchporting back to the last dungeon level on which you interrupted your journey. You can also transport [[foocubus|foocubi]] to Sokoban or another level where a lack of armor is less instantly hazardous.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], the Eye of the Aethiopica also conferred magic resistance when carried in the inventory, and branchporting to Sokoban or Vlad's Tower would always bring you to the branch's bottom floor.{{refsrc|src/do.c|1083|version=NetHack 3.4.3}}

==Mythology==
''Aethiopica'' (Αἰθιοπικά) simply means "Ethiopian" in Ancient Greek. The name is most likely a reference to the influential ancient Greek novel ''Aethiopica'', which takes place in ancient Ethiopia at various points; Charicleia, one of the main characters, has a dream about an eye being cut out.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
This is a powerful amulet of ESP.  In addition to its standard powers, it regenerates the energy of anyone who carries it, allowing them to cast spells more often.  It also reduces any spell damage to the person who carries it by half, and protects from magic missiles.  Finally, when invoked it has the power to instantly open a portal to any other area of the dungeon, allowing its invoker to travel quickly between areas.

'''The Eyes of the Overworld''' is the [[Monk]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the reward for completing the [[Monk quest]], and is [[neutral]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its [[base item]] type is a [[pair of lenses]].

== Effects ==
{{main|Astral vision}}

While wearing the Eyes, in addition to the usual effects of lenses, you are granted astral vision: the squares around you are illuminated as would be lit by a [[lamp]]. The Eyes also provide [[magic resistance]] when worn; prior to version 3.6.0, the Eyes provided magic resistance when simply carried. [[Invoking]] the Eyes provides [[enlightenment]].

Astral vision penetrates [[wall]]s, [[door]]s, [[solid rock]], and any other obstruction. Objects seen through astral vision using the [[farlook]] command are described as though you had personally handled the item (a behavior similar to a blessed [[potion of object detection]]; for example, viewing a scroll on the floor will tell you its label, not merely "a scroll," and gems discovered embedded in rock will appear with whatever [[name|type-name]] you might have given them.

[[Blindness]] from any source will not obstruct your vision if you are wearing the Eyes; internally, the game tracks the duration and cause of your blindness, but all effects of those status ailments are overridden by astral vision, similar to [[Grayswandir]]'s behavior with [[hallucination]]. Astral vision does not grant its usual "vision" properties while on the [[Rogue level]]; monsters, tiles, and items are not revealed through darkness or obstructions, but the Eyes will still prevent and override blindness.

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Invoke#Optimum invocation schedule|Invoke § Optimum invocation schedule]]''

Astral vision is highly useful in trying to find secret doors or trying to navigate [[Gehennom]] without [[magic mapping]].
