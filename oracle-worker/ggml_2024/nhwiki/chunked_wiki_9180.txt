** `-fPIC` no longer included with static builds.
** `libnitrohack.a` no longer installed with static builds, since it's already rolled into the game binary.
* Treat improperly-truncated save files like crashed ones, instead of trying and failing to load/restore them.

* Fix "bad fruit" warnings when slime mold is in inventory while inventory sidebar is updated while saving bones.

=== DynaHack 0.5.5 (2014-01-16, 78d772a) ===

DynaHack 0.5.5 was a bugfix release for a potential crash with items contained
in statues interacting with the timer-related fixes in the previous releases.

==== Technical ====

* Prevent a crash when the timer-related fixes of the past couple of releases touched items contained in statues due to the latter's failure to correctly set their level.

=== DynaHack 0.5.4 (2014-01-06, 34706ac) ===

DynaHack 0.5.4 was a hotfix release for a timer-related issue.

==== Technical ====

* Fix lights and timers failing to follow the items they were attached to when the items were moved between levels, causing affected games to fail to load.

=== DynaHack 0.5.3 (2013-12-24, 32216b3) ===

DynaHack 0.5.3 was a bugfix release that fixed a panic when loading a game with
timed items in the Advent Calendar as well as a few other bugs, and adds the
new `darkmsg` option to control whether past messages are darkened.

==== Character ====

* Fix warning when trying to take off merged dragon skin.

==== Dungeon ====

* Prevent the Advent Calendar exit portal from being created in one of its closets (from UnNetHack).

==== Items ====

* Various `#tip` fixes from the same feature in UnNetHack:
** Tipping a trapped container triggers the trap.
** Fix tipping of a zero-charge bag of tricks being used as a normal bag.
** Prevent autopickup from picking up tipped items.
** Observe cat when tipping boxes dropped by quantum mechanics.

==== Configuration ====

* `darkmsg` option: toggle whether or not older messages are colored dark blue in the message box.

==== Miscellaneous ====

* Fix blank lines being eaten when viewing license and version history in-game.

==== Technical ====

* Fix billing of items in nested containers and crediting of contained gold in the deep recesses of the shop code that could lead those things suddenly and silently becoming shopkeeper property, even if they didn't typically sell them!
* Fix utilities updating but failing to rebuild the data files that depended on them; stale data files like the ones packaged with DynaHack 0.5.0 should be a thing of the past.
* Fix crash when positioning a revived monster on entering a level.
* Fix panic due to timers failing to find the Advent Calendar level during loading (the last level of the ledger in general), preventing affected games from being loaded.

=== DynaHack 0.5.2 (2013-10-07, 5f067e7) ===

DynaHack 0.5.2 was a hotfix release that greatly increased save file integrity
and ability to recover save files by fixing cases of incomplete data being
logged that were overlooked by NitroHack and NetHack4.

==== Saves ====

* Fix systemic oversight in save code ported from NetHack4 that failed to ensure that diffs of the binary save section were being fully written to the log, leading to save corruption.
* Fix `autopickup_rules` and `msgtype` failing to ensure that changes to them were being fully written to the log, leading to save corruption.

=== DynaHack 0.5.1 (2013-09-28, a1289c3) ===

DynaHack 0.5.1 was a hotfix release to fix a packaging mistake with the Windows
release that caused special levels to fail to load.

==== Configuration ====

* Disable `darkroom` by default when `darkgray` is also off by default, since it led to ugly dark blue for almost everything not in direct line-of-sight.

==== Technical ====

* Fix a major packaging mistake with the pre-compiled Windows build where certain special level data files had a version number incompatible with the shipped game executable and thus refusing to load them and show a generic full-level maze instead.

=== DynaHack 0.5.0 (2013-09-18, 65751e0) ===

DynaHack 0.5.0 is the first public release of DynaHack.  It was originally
intended to be a port of UnNetHack using NitroHack instead of NetHack 3.4.3 as
a base (in fact it was originally named "UnNitroHack", though no version with
that name was ever officially released), but has since taken on a life of its
own with interface and reliability improvements from NetHack4, highlights from
other NetHack variants such as random magical equipment from GruntHack and
monster spoiler info from UnNetHackPlus, plus many of its own changes.

UnNetHack itself is a NetHack variant that features more randomness, challenges,
levels and fun, rolling in many community patches, selected changes from other

==== Interface ====

* New Curses-based text mode interface:
** Unicode display with customizable display chars
** arrow/function key recognition
** multi-line message box
** improved status area
** permanent inventory sidebar (if terminal is wide enough)
* Item action menus: Press the item letter in the inventory for common actions.
* Main menu that lets you choose to start a new game, restore an existing one, change options and more.
* Fully configurable keymap.
* Arrow keys move the cursor in text prompts instead of abruptly killing them.
* Item lists are sorted based on name, enchantment, BUC, erodeproofing, erosion and greasing.
* Item class headings show the symbol in item lists.
* The 'uncursed' status of an item can be explicitly shown in item names.
* Unexplored locations, stone and dark rooms can be customized to display as different characters on the map.
* Naming of monsters, items and item types occur via a menu.
* Much longer message history (20k messages!).
* Removing armor/jewelry always gives a prompt even if there's only one choice.
* Open doors automatically when walking into them.

==== Options ====

* All options can now be changed in-game instead of using ".nethackrc".
* Changes to options made in-game are saved and restored.  The underlying files can be found under `~/.config/NitroHack/`.
* Birth options: Options like ELBERETH, REINCARNATION, SEDUCE and bones files, which previously could only be changed by rebuilding the game, can now be set on beginning a new game.

==== Items ====

* Spellbooks can be read early (while memory of the spell still exists).

==== Monsters ====

* Monsters can be cycled by pressing `m` while targeting.
* Extinct species are shown along with genocided ones when games end.

==== Autopickup ====

* Autopickup Rules: fine-grained rules to control what autopickup picks up or leaves, e.g. the following rules pick up all food and lizard corpses but no other corpses:

    1. IF name matches "*lizard*" AND type is "food": < GRAB
    2. IF name matches "*corpse*" AND type is "food":   LEAVE >
    3. IF type is "food":                             < GRAB

If no matching rule is found the item is left behind by default.

* `pickup_thrown` option: Thrown or fired items will always be picked up automatically.

==== Dungeon overview ====

* `#overview`/Ctrl-O shows a list of all remembered levels and major features. Choosing a level views your memory of it.
* You can `#annotate` a level to describe it, which appears in the overview.

==== Character history tracking ====

* Heroic deeds are logged and can be viewed with the `#history` command:
** new depth reached
** experience level gained
** wishes
** killing a unique monster
** life saved
** crowning
** artifact gift received
** basic quest status
** major oracle consultations
** performing the invocation
** gaining/losing the Amulet of Yendor (only if formally identified)

==== Dumplog ====

* When you die, a text file will be created with the following information:
** final screenshot (in ASCII)
** character stats
** inventory and contents of carried containers
** character attributes
** known spells
** skills
** conducts
** vanquished opponents
** final messages
** dungeon overview
** heroic deeds (as seen in `#history`)

==== Interactive replays ====

* Saved and finished games can be replayed with a viewer built into the game client.  Commands like view inventory can be performed while viewing a replay.

==== Miscellaneous ====

* Improve died-while-helpless descriptions.
* Fixed about 10% of all known NetHack bugs.

==== Technical ====

* NitroHack network protocol: Supports network play without telnet or ssh.  The protocol is based on JSON and makes it easier to implement a browser-based NitroHack client (TODO!).
** The game is divided into a client and server: the client has a copy of the game for independent local play but can also connect to a server for online play.
* New save game format: NetHack's save format was mostly just a dump of binary structures to disk.  The new format has two sections:
*# A log of the initial random seed and every game action performed, written continuously as the game is played.
*# If the game is not being played, a binary save appended after the log. This section uses a fixed-width, fixed-endian architecture and compiler-independent format which resembles NetHack's format but can be loaded on any system the game will run on.
* Full separation of interface code from game code.
** The game core has been moved into a library (libnitrohack.so/nitrohack.dll), exposing an API of 23 functions and is largely OS independent.
** The display code is part of the OS/platform and must provide a list of callbacks (windowprocs) to the game.
** The core game and display code have no shared global state.
* Rewritten input system: The game core never requests raw keys from the interface.  All interactions happen on an abstract level: the interface sends commands to the game core as strings ("wait", "move", etc.), and the game core may ask for a direction or position, etc.
* Layered drawing: The game core provides a set of display items for each location instead of just setting the topmost like NetHack.  The Curses interface blinks between them; this can be toggled with an option.
* Mersenne Twister random number generator: Required to make game logs replayable.
* Re-runnable game core: Several main data structures have been made const, all others are carefully re-initialized when a game is started or restored.
** This makes it possible to provide the main menu.
** NitroHack now uses a setjmp/longjmp exception mechanism to escape from deep call-chains when the game ends or panics.
* Temporary level files and lock files removed.
** All levels are now kept in memory at all times, making a lot of locking unnecessary, and allowing them to be viewed even from other levels.
** Only active game logs are locked, and even then only using OS-provided non-file-based locking (fcntl on UNIX and LockFile on Windows).
* No more support for antique systems and compilers.
** Dropped operating systems: BE, DOS, Classic Mac, Atari, VMS, Ultrix, etc.
** Supported compilers has been reduced to gcc, clang and msvc (probably Intel's compiler too).
** Doing this allowed the removal of lots of crufty code and compat macros, e.g. all current compilers support `void` and `static` so wrapping them in defines is no longer needed.
* Code cleanups.
** Number of `#ifdef FOO` has been cut down from 1938 to just 51, making the code much more readable since indentation isn't being interrupted every couple of lines.  Compile options that weren't turned into birth options were removed as a result.  Functions have been converted to use standard prototypes rather than pre-C89 K&R declarations.  Ugly things like prototype widening and follow-on `FOO_P` defines were removed too. Thanks to these changes, tools like `git diff` can now correctly show what function a line is in.
** All instances of the `register` keyword have been removed since optimizing compilers handle this for us.
** NEARDATA has been removed since it only made sense on 16-bit computers.
* New CMake-based build system.
** This removes the need to manually edit Makefiles and header files just to build the game.
** Provides safe parallel builds with colorized output on Linux, and generates Visual Studio project files that build without problems on Windows.

&&%s&& %s Spoon {148628 2022-10-05T10:48:13Z {375 Ion frigate} it is wishable, though quite useless {{stub}}
The '''spoon''' is an item that appears in some variants of ''[[NetHack]]''.

==SLASH'EM==
{{tool
  |color=metal color
  |tile=[[Image:spoon.png]]
  |name=spoon
  |appearance=spoon
  |cost=5000
  |material=platinum
  |weight=1
}}

In [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SLASHTHEM]], the spoon serves as the base item for [[Houchou]].  It is not randomly generated,<ref>[[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/objects.c#line791]]</ref> but it can be wished for. Doing so is inadvisable however, as non-artifact spoons have no use.

Applying a spoon will result in the message: "It's a finely crafted antique spoon; what do you want to do with it?" Despite the wording, this is not a prompt, so the player can't actually do anything special with it.
{{clear}}

==dNetHack==
{{weapon
  |name=spoon
  |tile=[[Image:spoon.png]]
  |appearance=spoon
  |smalldmg=1d1
  |largedmg=1d1
  |skill=knife
  |size=one-handed
  |cost=1
  |weight=1
  |material=iron
}}

In [[dNetHack]], the spoon is made of [[iron]] and classified as a [[weapon-tool]] that uses the knife skill. It is the starting "weapon" of the [[Convict]], and acts as the base item for the Convict's new quest artifact, the [[Iron Spoon of Liberation]]. Spoons are not randomly generated.

They do 1d1 damage to both small and large targets, weigh 1 unit and have a base price of 1 [[Zorkmid|zm]].

Эффект накладывает на монстра шанс на сбой заклинания, беспорядочное движение и, возможно, атаку соседней цели (подробнее [[confusion#Monster_Confusion|о замешательстве]]). Обычный свиток дает одну из этих возможностей, в то время как благословленный свиток дает 2-8 дополнительных использований. Дополнительное чтение не проклятого или обычного свитка даст вам дополнительные использования, не более 40, иначе добавится только один ход{{refsrc|read.c|850|comment=after a while, repeated uses become less effective}}. Ваши атаки зависят от [[Magic_resistance_(monster)|сопротивления магии]] противника, поэтому не все атаки наложат эффект на цель с высоким сопротивлением, но использование снимается при каждом ударе. Вы получите сообщение "'''Вы собираетесь сбить с толку монстра (You are going to confuse monsters)'''".

Если прочитать проклятый свиток замешательства или прочитать обычный или проклятый свиток в состоянии замешательства, то вы будите сами в замешательстве в течении 1-100 (дополнительных) ходок. Вы получите сообщение "'''Ваши руки начинают светиться фиолетовым (Your hands begin to glow purple)'''" если свиток обычным, или не получите никакого сообщения для проклятого свитка. Если прочитать благословленный свиток в состоянии замешательства, то он снимет с вас все эффекты замешательства.

Чтение этого свитка любого качества, будучи в замешательстве или нет, в форме монстра собьет вас с толку на 1-100 (дополнительных) ходов. В превращенной форме без [[hands|рук]], вы не сможете наложить эффект замешательства на противника.

Использование [[Spellbook of confuse monster|соответствующего заклинания]] дает тот же эффект, что и чтение свитка.

==Сообщения==
Если в сообщении говорится о "покалывании (tingling)", значит в этот момент вы [[blind|слепы]]. Если у вас [[hallucinating|галлюцинации]] "красный" или "фиолетовый" поменяются на другое прилагательное. Поскольку успешно получить способность вы можете только в не-монстро подобной форме, то слова "голова" или "руки" никогда не заменятся.
