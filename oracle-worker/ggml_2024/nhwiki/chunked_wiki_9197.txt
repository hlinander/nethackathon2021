Artifacts are listed above by alignment, then alphabetically with the
Quest Artifacts listed later.  The name of each ARTIFACT may have been
abbreviated to fit in the table above; see below for the official name.
Artifacts are special instances of ordinary objects, and have all of the
behaviors and properties of the ordinary ITEM in addition to those
granted by the particular artifact; they are however considerably more
valuable, as indicated by the COST field.

The GENER field specifies all of the possible ways that a particular
artifact may be generated.  Each artifact can only be generated _once_
per game -- it cannot be generated again, even if the player never found
the artifact, if the artifact is stolen, or if the artifact is destroyed.
Note that in some cases, an ordinary object may be converted into an
artifact, but no artifact will be converted into another artifact.  The
meaning of the letters are as follows:
 a  Humanoid angelic species have a 5% chance of being generated with a
    blessed, rustproof Demonbane or Sunsword; 100% for Archons.
 b  All artifacts on the current level are saved when a character dies
    and creates a bones file.  If a new character visits the same level
    and loads the bones file, the same artifacts will be created, except
    under the following conditions.  If the artifact was already created
    in the new player's game or is the new player's Quest Artifact, then
    the artifact reverts to its ordinary object.  The Unique Items
    (Bell of Opening, Candelabrum of Invocation, Book of the Dead, and
    Amulet of Yendor) will revert into ordinary objects (cursed bell,
    pile of used candles, cursed spellbook of blank paper, and cursed
    fake amulet of Yendor, respectively).
 c  If you pray and your god is very pleased, you may be crowned and get
    a good artifact, though Wizards and Monks may instead receive a
    spellbook of finger of death or restore ability respectively.  If a
    lawful character is wielding an ordinary long sword when crowned, it
    becomes Excalibur.  Neutrals get Vorpal Blade, regardless of what they
    are wielding (if already wielding it, it goes "snicker-snack!").
    Chaotics get Stormbringer, regardless of what they are wielding.  You
    can only be crowned once.  If you were restricted to unskilled in the
    weapon class of your alignment's artifact, the restriction is removed
    so you may advance to basic skill.
 d  If you #dip a single ordinary long sword in a fountain, are at least
    experience level 5, and Excalibur doesn't already exist in your game,
    then there is a 1/6 chance of something special happening to your
    long sword.  If you are lawful, the long sword is converted into
    the blessed, rustless, uncorroded, damageproof Excalibur and you
    exercise your wisdom.  If you are neutral or chaotic, your long
    sword is cursed, loses its rustproofing, may lose an enchantment,
    and you abuse your wisdom.
 g  This Unique Item is an essential part of the game, and can only be
    obtained by killing (or stealing it from) the appropriate Nemesis.
    These items are specially protected from being destroyed.  They
    also do not count toward the number of artifacts that have been
    generated.
 n  An ordinary item can be converted into this artifact by #naming it.
    The item must be singular, not already an artifact, of the same type
    as the new artifact, and the new artifact must not already exist.
    Answer that you want to #name a single item, and provide the short
    name of the artifact (i.e. "Sting" instead of "elven dagger named
    Sting").
 o  This item may be given (non-cursed, and erodeproof if applicable) as
    a gift from your god when #offering corpses.  You must sacrifice a
    fresh corpse at a co-aligned altar, be in good standing with your god,
    have non-negative luck, and be at least experience level 3. You will
    only get artifacts that are of your alignment or none, and some
    classes get certain artifacts as their first gift (if available).
    Your first gift will always be co-aligned.
    Orcs will never receive elven weapons, or vice versa.
    The chance that you will be given a gift depends on the number of
    artifacts already created in the game and how many of them were
    gifts; the chance is 1/(10+(2*artifacts*gifts)).
    If you receive a weapon artifact this way and were restricted in
    its weapon class to unskilled, the restriction is removed so you
    may advance to basic skill.
 r  This artifact may be randomly generated in place of a regular item
    (1/20 chance for each weapon).  In particular, antique weapons
    outlets appear to frequently carry artifacts because a large number
    of weapons are randomly generated there.  The player-monsters on the
    Astral Plane also have a 50% chance that the weapon they are
    generated will be upgraded to one of these random artifacts.
 q  This is a Quest Artifact.  If you are of the same class as the
    artifact, you can only obtain it by completing your Quest.
    Otherwise it can only be obtained by bones levels or wishing.
    If you are neither the same class nor the same alignment, you cannot
    pick it up, wield it, or wear it.
 w  This artifact can be wished for.  You may specify either the short
    name of the artifact (e.g. "Magicbane") or the long name ("athame
    named Magicbane"); capitalization does not matter.  You cannot wish
    for Unique Items or your own Quest Artifact; there are also
    limitations on wishing for other classes' Quest Artifacts based on
    your class and alignment (see "q" above).  The chance of getting an
    artifact from each wish depends on the number of artifacts already
    created in the game:
        ARTIFACTS   0     1     2     3    4    5    6      n
        CHANCE     100%  100%  2/3   2/4  2/5  2/6  2/7  2/(n+1)

The first letter of the ALN column indicates the alignment of the artifact
(Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), if any.  When playing a class which can have
multiple alignments, the alignment of the Quest Artifact will be adjusted
to match the character's starting alignment.  A second letter specifies
the class aligned to the artifact; alignments of these artifacts will also
be adjusted if necessary. It also indicates which Quest Artifact belongs
to each class, and for artifacts available as sacrifice gifts denotes that
the artifact is the guaranteed first gift for that class.  Intelligent
artifacts are indicated with a ! symbol.  All three conditions are
considered each time you attempt to wish for, pick up, wield, wear,
invoke, apply, or steal an artifact:
 *  If the artifact is intelligent, then in order to touch the artifact
    safely, you must have the same alignment as the artifact, must be of
    the same class (or no class is specified), must have non-negative
    alignment, and must not be in the form of something the artifact
    specially attacks. Otherwise, you will be blasted by the artifact's
    power, sustain 4d10 damage (2d10 if you have magic resistance), and
    abuse your wisdom.
    If you are of the wrong class and fail at least one of the other
    conditions above, then the artifact will furthermore "evade your
    grasp!" and you will not be able to use it at all.  
 *  If the artifact is not intelligent, then you have only a 1/4 chance
    of being blasted if you have a different alignment from the artifact
    or have negative alignment (these two criteria not applying for
    unaligned artifacts), or are in the form of something the artifact
    specially attacks; damage is 4d4 (2d4 if you have magic resistance).
    In any case, you will be able to use the artifact.
 *  Orcrist and Sting will never blast non-orcs.
Intelligent artifacts furthermore have an 80% chance of resisting being
cursed by "malignant aura"-type curses.

The +HIT column specifies any bonuses when calculating to-hit, and +DAM
lists any bonuses or multiplier to damage.  For some artifacts, these
adjustments only apply when hitting a specific type of monster.  See
weap-343.txt to find out how these values are used in weapons calculations.
Additional damage due to level drain, bisecting, or beheading are not
included in the table above, but are listed in the weapon descriptions
below.  Note that the chance of certain weapon artifact effects are
based on your to-hit die roll.  This means that if you always hit a
monster, the effect occurs with the published percentage; however, if
you only hit a monster 1 in 20, then every hit you make causes the effect.

The ATTACK and DEFEND fields list a brief summary of the offensive and
defensive effects of each artifact; see the sections below for full
descriptions of each artifact's abilities.  The effects of the Bell of
Opening, Candelabrum of Invocation, and Book of the Dead are documented
in tool-343.txt.  The powers of the Amulet of Yendor are listed in
amul-343.txt.

Magicbane
~~~~~~~~~
[Adapted from a spoiler courtesy of David Grabiner.]

Magicbane has several special effects when wielded that make this
artifact a very useful item.  It resists 95% of curses thrown at you,
gives magic resistance, and can engrave without dulling.  As a weapon,
it may (depending on the monster's magic resistance saving throw) add
additional damage and magical effects.

The above table describes the chance that each of the magical attacks
will occur, assuming that the monster fails the magic resistance
saving throw it gets to reduce their probability.  The ENCHANTment of
Magicbane affects these probabilities; note that higher enchantments
reduce the likelihood of the better attacks. (Negative enchantments
have the same probabilities as at +0.)  Even the NORMAL, non-magical
damage that occurs 60% of the time has an extra d4 damage above that
of a normal athame unless the monster resists.  If any magical attacks
occur, additional d4s of damage are added; at most one of the
individual attacks may cause a magical effect as detailed below.

The PROBE attack usually does nothing special beyond adding the d4 for
the magical attack; if no other effect has occurred, there is a 1 in
(3 * (absolute value of enchantment)) chance that the probe is
insightful, giving the effect of a wand of probing. A probe is always
insightful if Magicbane is at +0.
  "The magic-absorbing blade probes <monster>!"
  "The magic-absorbing blade prods <monster>!" (hallucinating)

The STUN attack causes an additional d4 damage; if none of the later
effects have occurred and been successful, it stuns the monster (or
you, for 3 (more) turns, if you are being attacked by Magicbane).
  "The magic-absorbing blade stuns <monster>!"
  "The magic-absorbing blade amazes <monster>!" (hallucinating)

The SCARE attack causes an additional d4 damage; if not combined with
a CANCEL attack, causes the monster to flee for 3 (more) turns; the
monster has a 50% chance of being given an opportunity to resist this
effect. If you are being attacked by Magicbane and aren't
magic-resistant, this effect paralyses you for 3 (more) turns.
  "The magic-absorbing blade scares <monster>!"
  "The magic-absorbing blade tickles <monster>!" (hallucinating)

Finally, the CANCEL attack causes another additional d4 damage and has
the same effect as a spell of cancellation (but with a fixed level of
10 for resistance saving throw purposes). If the monster has the
ability to cast spells, the effect adds one to your current and
maximum spell energy. The monster may resist. If you are hit with
Magicbane and you don't have magic-resistance, you are cancelled and
lose one current and maximum spell energy.
  "The magic-absorbing blade cancels <monster>!"
  "The magic-absorbing blade purges <monster>!"

In addition, any magical attack has a 1 in 12 chance of confusing the
defender.

The AVE DMG column in the table above summarizes the expected average
damage for each enchantment level; it includes bonuses due to
enchantment but not to weapon skills (athames are in the dagger
class). (Again, note that a monster with a high base magic resistance
saving throw may reduce the severity of the attacks that occur, as
well as averting the potential magical effects; the quoted figures are
for monsters with 0 MR.)  The Damage row lists the amount of damage
each type of attack causes; the average of each attack type is given
in the Ave dmg row.

For those source divers who are interested in how the above values were
obtained, the following table may help:

What is the best enchantment for Magicbane?  If you simply want to cause
the most damage, then the table indicates that you should enchant it as
high as possible (safely to +7).  Fortunately, your odds of magic-
resistance, curse-resistance, and engraving do not depend upon the
enchantment.  However, if you want to maximize the best magical attacks
of this artifact, it should be enchanted to +2.  Note that the only
difference in the magical attacks between the +0 and the +2 Magicbane is
a 3.7% change between probing and stunning.

Magicbane is generally not the best weapon for combat, although
medium-level characters with good dagger skill and poor skills in other
weapon may find it their best choice.  Higher-level characters may want
to wield it as their regular weapon to absorb curses while they are
travelling through the dungeon, switching to something else to fight
powerful monsters.


Which artifact should I choose?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Adapted from a spoiler courtesy of David Grabiner.]

If you get an early wish and decide to use it for a weapon, or if you
have accumulated several artifact weapons, which weapon you should wield
depends highly on your class because of the class limits on weapon
skills.

ARTIFACT weapons that are worth keeping are listed in the table below.
Some artifacts are not listed, because they are only effective against
a small subset of monsters.  The SKILL category of each artifact is
listed, as well as the maximum skill level for each class (ABCH KMPRaRo
STVW): - means restricted to unskilled, b means basic skill, s means
skilled, and E means expert.  Note that if you receive an artifact as a
gift by crowning or sacrificing, any restriction on its weapon class will
be removed and you will be able to advance to basic skill.

The table also indicates the damage range of each artifact against
typical SMALL creatures, LARGE creatures, and major DEMONs.  The damage
calculations assume that the artifact is enchanted as shown, you have
expert skill, and that the artifact's special attacks apply to the
monster; the Longbow of Diana assumes that you are using normal +0
arrows fired at a rate of up to 4 a round (expert Ranger). Damage
against major demons further assumes that the weapon is blessed and that
the demon hates silver, is fire-resistant, and is drain-resistant.
Finally, the table summarizes the average damage against major demons
(DAVE), which are often the nastiest creatures in the dungeon. 
Magicbane's actual damage is slightly greater due to its special
attacks, but it doesn't make a difference here.

Six artifacts are particularly good all-purpose weapons and will be
considered further.  

* Magicbane (MB) has several magical effects (see section above) that
  make it a good weapon even though it doesn't cause much damage
  (particularly if you are limiting its enchantment to +2 to maximise
  its special attacks). Magicbane is also good if you don't have
  magic resistance or are short of ways to remove curses.
* Stormbringer (SB) permanently drains levels from monsters --
  although some species are resistant, including major demons -- and
  will attack tame or peaceful creatures without confirmation, so it's
  bad if you're trying to keep a pet.
* Excalibur (EX) is easy to get if you are lawful (dip a long sword in
  a fountain), has automatic searching, and is a somewhat effective
  weapon.
* Mjollnir (MJ) causes lightning damage, and when thrown by a Valkyrie
  with strength 25, will usually return to your hand. Being a hammer,
  it is good for classes who are restricted from blades. However, it
  may destroy useful wands and rings carried by monsters.
* Frost Brand (FB) causes cold damage, which makes it an excellent
  all-around weapon. However, it may freeze useful potions carried by
  monsters. Although Fire Brand similarly causes fire damage, most
  major demons are fire-resistant.
* Grayswandir (GS) doubles most of its damage (working best when fully
  enchanted) and causes silver damage. Even though Grayswandir causes
  the most damage to major demons, Frost Brand is slightly better
  against ordinary large monsters.

The table below compares these six artifacts for each character CLASS.
The EARLY GAME recommendation assumes that you will quickly reach maximum
skill in the weapon and that the weapon is enchanted to +2, which
might be expected from wishing or limited enchantment.  The LATE GAME
recommendation assumes that you are maximally skilled and that the weapon
is enchanted as in the above table.  If a weapon is listed with a slash,
this means that several are comparable and the choice may depend on other
factors.  An artifact is listed in parentheses if its skill starts as
restricted; you will usually want to obtain it or a weapon of its class
as a divine gift in order to unrestrict the skill before using it.

The weapons listed include any weapon which could reasonably be the best
for that class, as well as weapons which may be obtained without a wish
and which are close in quality:

* Excalibur is a good weapon early in the game for lawful characters,
  because it does almost as much damage as Frost Brand and can be
  obtained without a wish; its lack of double damage makes it inferior
  later, as Frost Brand's damage and strength bonuses will be doubled.
* The Staff of Aesculapius and the Tsurugi of Muramasa, Quest
  Artifacts for Healers and Samurai, are powerful weapons; they have
  the disadvantage of requiring two hands, but both do more damage
  early in the game than any other available weapon.  The Tsurugi
  becomes inferior late in the game, because its damage bonus is not
  doubled; the Staff is at a disadvantage in Gehennom because it will
  lose its double damage against level-drain-resistant demons.
* The Longbow of Diana, Quest Artifact for Rangers, is a highly useful
  back-up weapon for fighting at a distance, but has the disadvantage
  of extremely variable damage depending on the vagaries of multiple
  shots, and the fact that the supply of arrows is unenchanted.

     Wiz   -   -   -   E   -   -   MB              (FB)/(GS)

It's interesting that Magicbane does so well early in the game; this is
a side effect of the weapon skills.  Even for those classes which don't
have it listed, it's a good artifact to wish for because it serves other
useful purposes (magic resistance, engraving, and curse resistance).
It's a useful weapon to keep as your main weapon after you have killed
the Wizard; you can switch to Frost Brand when a lot of nasties appear,
because Magicbane takes a long time to kill them, and powerful creatures
will resist Magicbane's special attacks.

Comestibles are listed above by category, then by increasing nutrition.
Japanese names of items are listed in parentheses ().  The COST field
denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the weight (100
zorkmids weighs 1).

Food comprises 20% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
15% in containers, 22% on the  Rogue level, and 16% in hell.  PROB is the
relative probability of each subtype.  Eggs not laid by you have a
roughly 1/3 probability of hatching.  Tins are 1/6 spinach and are 5%
blessed, 90% uncursed, and 5% cursed.  All other comestibles will be
generated uncursed.

The nutrition of each item is listed under NUTR.  The cost of all items
are based on the nutrition by the formula COST = (NUTR / 20) +5, with
fractions rounded off.  Note that several previously archived spoilers
did not correctly round their costs.  The ratio of nutrition to weight
is listed in the NUTR/WGT column; lembas wafers have the best ratio.
The amount of time needed to completely eat an item is given under TIME.


Hunger and nutrition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "food" by Bryan Butler and J. Ali Harlow.)

Each of the following conditions is checked on the turns shown; if it is
the case, then you lose one more point of nutrition that turn.  Rings
and amulets cause additional hunger as shown; the only exception is a
ring that can be charged but is at +0. A ring of slow digestion prevents
base ordinary food consumption, but still causes ring hunger.  You can
therefore consume a maximum of 64 nutrition in 20 turns (if all of these
conditions were met).
  HOW OFTEN      CAUSE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~
  Each turn      Ordinary food consumption, if carnivorous or herbivorous
                 and not wearing a ring of slow digestion. When asleep,
                 only about 10% as much is needed.
  Odd turns      Regeneration from anything other than an artifact.
  Odd turns      Encumbrance is stressed or worse.

Naturally, eating some food will make you gain the amount of nutrition
in the food.  Your level of nutrition is described as follows:
  2000 or more           Death from choking (under certain circumstances)
  1000 or more           Satiated
   150 to  999           Not hungry
    50 to  149           Hungry
     0 to   49           Weak
  Below zero             Fainting
  Below (-200)-(20*CON)  Death from starvation


Corpses

(Adapted from the spoiler "corpses", by Boudewijn Waijers and
Peter Snelling.)

When a monster is killed, the probability of leaving a corpse depends on
several factors:
  PROB  CONDITIONS
  ~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~
    0%  Killed by digestion or disintegration.
    0%  Killed by stoning (creates a statue instead).
    0%  Corpses are never generated on the Rogue level.
    0%  Golems leave objects instead of a corpse.
    0%  Some monsters never leave a corpse (e.g., Vlad, liches).
  100%  Lizards, monsters of large size or bigger.
  100%  The Riders and player-monsters on the Astral Plane.
   1/2  Frequent monster that is not tiny
   1/3  Monster appears infrequently or is tiny (but not both).
   1/4  Monster both appears infrequently and is tiny.
There is a further reduction of the above chances for undead creatures
that die on a graveyard level: by 1/9 if it was killed by you or by
1/3 if it was not killed by you (e.g., by a trap or another monster).  
This means that wraiths have a better chance of leaving a corpse if you
lead them to a stairway and let them follow you to a non-graveyard
level, a technique called "wraith luring". For this purpose, the
Castle and all levels of the Priest Quest are considered graveyard
levels, as is any level on which undead have been summoned by the 
cursed Book of the Dead or Bell of Opening.

The nutrition, weight, and time needed to eat corpses is determined by
the type of monster.  The blessed/cursed status of corpses adjusts how
