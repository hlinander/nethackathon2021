	In winter or summer, 'twas always the same—
		You could never meet either alone.
	
	And when quarrels arose—as one frequently finds
		Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour—
	The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
		And cemented their friendship for ever!

'''Bandersnatchii''' are monsters in [[dNetHack]]. They can't be [[Scare|frightened]]; instead they become "frumious", increasing their speed to 36 and doubling their damage.

A player polymorphed into a bandersnatch can [[pounding|pound]] with the #[[monster (command)|monster]] command.

{{encyclopedia|
	But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
		A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
	And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
		For he knew it was useless to fly.
	
	He offered large discount—he offered a check
		(Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:
	But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
		And grabbed at the Banker again.
	
	Without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws
		Went savagely snapping around—
	He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
		Till fainting he fell to the ground.
	The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
		Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
	And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"
		And solemnly tolled on his bell.

Grey as a mouse
Big as a house
Nose like a snake
I make the earth shake
As I tramp through the grass
Trees crack as I pass
With horns in my mouth
I walk in the South
Flapping big ears
Beyond count of years
I stump round and round
Never lie on the ground
Not even to die
Oliphaunt am I
Biggest of all	Huge, old, and tall
If ever you'd met me
You wouldn't forget me
If you never do
You won't think I'm true
But old Oliphaunt am I
And I never lie

Teleportation is permitted.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You find yourself standing in sight of the Circle of Change.  Something
 is obviously wrong here.  The Circle of Change is badly damaged, walls
 have been blasted apart and torn.
 You realize that the Master Shifter needs your assistance!

Next time:
 Once again, you stand before the Circle of Change.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again you face the Circle of Change.  Your intuition hints that this may be
 the final time you come here.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Greetings, honored <currentrank>.  It is good to see you."
 "Ah, <playername>!  Surely you can help us in our hour of need."
 "Greetings, <brother|sister>.  The Master Shifter has great need of your help."
 "Alas, it seems as if even <deity> has deserted us."
 "May <deity> be with you, <brother|sister>."

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 "Ah, <playername>, my <son|daughter>.  You have returned to us at last.
 A great blow has befallen our order; perhaps you can help us.
 First, however, I must determine if you are prepared for this
 great challenge."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Again, my <son|daughter>, you stand before me.  Are you ready now to help us?"

This message is not currently used:

 "Once more, <playername>, you stand before me.  Are you ready now?"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "You have been corrupted, <playername>!  How can you, a <currentrank>, deviate so from the
 teachings of <deity>?  Begone from this place!  You are no longer
 a <brother|sister> to this order.  We will try our best without you,
 as you have failed us utterly."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Alas, <playername>, it is not yet to be.  A mere <currentrank> could never
 withstand the might of the Transmuter.  Go forth, again into the world, and return
 when you have attained the rank of Clone."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "This is terrible, <playername>.  You have deviated from way of balance!
 You know that <deity> requires that we be impartial in the world around
 us.  The <brother|sister>hood must stand for utmost piety.
 "Go from here, atone for your sins against <deity>.  Return only when
 you have purified yourself."

When finally assigned the quest:

 "Yes, <playername>.  You are truly ready now.  I shall endevor to tell you
 what has occurred while you were away.
 "A short time ago we were beseiged by the Transmuter, a wizard  
 of great power. We though nothing of it as we were well defended
 and he would be no match for us because of our ability."
 "However through the use of great magic he opened a portal into 
 the room containing the Medallion of Shifters and stole it.  With its power
 he could easily see through our transformations.  He then summoned many 
 chameleons, and we can not transform in fear of destroying members of 
 our own clan. 
 "We need you to find the Transmuter's cave, and then, from there, travel
 to the Transmuter's lair.  If you can manage to defeat the Transmuter and return
 the Medallion of Shifters here, we can then drive off the legions of
 creatures that roam the land.
 "Go with <deity> as your guide, <playername>."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "You can prevail, if you rely on <deity>."
 "Remember that the Transmuter has great magic at his command."
 "Be strong, my <son|daughter>."
 "Beware, the Transmuter's Cave is guard by many Xorns and Chameleons."
 "You may not be able to affect the Transmuter with magical spells."
 "Acquire and wear the Medallion of Shifters if you can.  It will aid you
 against your enemies."
 "Call upon <deity> when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
 "The Xorns may pass through rock at will, beware of ambush!"
 "Beware the lava, <playername>.  If you do not, you may be consumed."
 "Wear the Medallion of Shifters.  It will assist you against the undead."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 You have entered a cave that seems to have been drastically altered by magic.
 There is smoke and fumes all around, yet the air seems moist and damp.
 You remember the descriptions of the Transmuter's cave, given to you by
 the Master Shifter.  It is ahead that you will find the Transmuter's trail.

When returning:
 Again, you stand before the Transmuter's Cave.

When first entering the goal level:
 The black fumes and heat wash over you as you decend into this dark
 place. Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...

When returning:
 Again, you have invaded the Transmuter's domain.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "Ah, so the Master Shifter has sent another shifter to retrieve
 the Medallion of Shifters.
 "No, I see you are no shifter.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
 after all.  Prepare to die, <currentrank>!  You shall never regain
 the Medallion of Shifters!

Upon further meetings:

 "So, <currentrank>.  Again you challenge me."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "Die now, <currentrank>.  You power is a mere speck compared to mine."

When you have the Medallion of Shifters, but the Transmuter is still alive:

 "You shall die, <currentrank>, and I will have the Medallion of Shifters back."

====Discouragement====

The Transmuter will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "Submit to my will, Doppelganger, and I shall spare you."
 "Your puny powers are no match for me, Doppelganger."
 "I shall have you turned into a newt for my pleasure!"
 "Despair now, <currentrank>.  <deity> cannot help you."
 "I shall feast upon your soul for many days, Doppelganger."
 "Your death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!"
 "You cannot defeat the Transmuter, you fool.  I shall kill you now."
 "Your precious Master Shifter will be my next victim."
 "I feel your powers failing you, <currentrank>.  You shall die now."
 "With the Medallion of Shifters, nothing can stand in my way."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Medallion of Shifters, you feel as though a great
 weight has been lifted from your shoulders.  You understand 
 why the Transmuter stole it from the Circle of Change, for with it, 
 a Doppelganger of <deity> could easily defeat his plans.
 You sense a message from <deity>.  Though not verbal, you
 get the impression that you must return to the Master Shifter as soon
 as possible.

When killing the nemesis:
 You hear the Transmuter gasp one last breath and collapse to the ground.
 Suddenly, you hear a voice in the back of your mind,
     How could you have defeated me? I was so much 
     more powerful, I had the Medallion of Shifters and legions of   
     creatures at my command. You are certainly a force
     to be reckoned with ... I pity the Wizard of Yendor.
 Then the voice of the Transmuter fades away, never to be heard again.

When returning to your quest leader:
 "You have returned, <playername>.  And with the Medallion of Shifters, I see.
 Congratulations.
 "I have been awaiting you return and have been thinking.  You
 should take the Medallion of Shifters with you.  Use it to restore the balance of    
 the world and serve <deity>.
 "Go forth, and let <deity> guide your steps."
