'''Disappear''' is a mage [[monster spell]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Description==
The disappear monster spell causes its caster to turn [[invisible]], and tends to be associated with particularly troublesome casters such as [[lich]]es and [[golden naga]]s. Peaceful and tame monsters will not use the spell unless you can [[see invisible]].

==Messages==

&&%s&& %s Drain strength {148977 2022-11-01T02:53:11Z {375 Ion frigate} Rephrase a bit: they can be restored through the normal means (potions of (extra|full) healing), it's just that restoring the attribute doesn't do it; also future-proofing (change unihorn to !restore ability) '''Drain strength''' is a [[monster spell]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' that reduces your [[strength]] attribute.

==Effects==
The spell is a melee-range mage spell; if cast at you and you do not have [[magic resistance]], the spell will inflict <var>1d(x &minus; 6)</var> points of strength damage, where <var>x</var> is the monster's level. Any strength drain that would take you below 3 strength is instead subtracted sixfold from your current and maximum [[hit points]].

Magic resistance completely negates the effects of this spell; [[half spell damage]] will halve the number of points of strength it attempts to drain. A [[ring of sustain ability]] will stop the loss of strength, but you still take damage to your current and max HP if that casting would have drained your strength below 3.

==Strategy==
This spell, along with the [[touch of death]], is a big reason not to face powerful spellcasting monsters without MR - high-level casters can do massive amounts of damage with this spell, and maximum HP lost this way are not restored when your strength is restored (e.g., via a [[potion of restore ability]]). For example, a 70 HP character with 15 strength being attacked by a level 25 [[arch-lich]] will lose d19 strength from the spell - in the worst-case scenario, our character's strength will go to 3 and he will also lose 42 points from his maxHP, leaving him thoroughly hampered at 28 max HP.

==Messages==
{{message|You suddenly feel weaker!|A monster cast this spell at you, and you lost at least one point of strength from it. This is still displayed even if the stat loss is blocked through a ring of sustain ability.}}
{{message|You feel momentarily weakened.|As above, but nothing happened because you have magic resistance}}.

&&%s&& %s Destroy armor (monster spell) {138798 2021-04-05T22:37:14Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Description */ Grammar/style '''Destroy armor''' is a [[Mage spell|mage]] [[monster spell]] used in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Description==
This spell will target a piece of worn [[armor]], using a weighted random selection, and destroy it. The process is the same as for an uncursed [[scroll of destroy armor]]. [[Magic resistance]] completely nullifies the effects of this spell. Destroy armor tends to be cast primarily by [[lich]]es and [[golden naga]]s.

&&%s&& %s Curse items {146207 2022-06-12T19:34:20Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Non-spell sources */ '''Curse items''' is one of the most despised [[monster spell]]s in [[NetHack]]. It can be cast in melee range by monsters such as [[lich]]es, or encountered in other ways. It will unbless or [[curse]] a number of your inventory items, which can reduce their effects or make them dangerous and difficult to remove. It can be used by both mage spell users (of level 11 or higher){{refsrc|mcastu.c|387}} and clerical spell users (of level 10 or higher).{{refsrc|mcastu.c|530}}

==Effects==
The spell will normally affect 1d6 random items in your inventory if it succeeds; blessed items will become uncursed and uncursed items will become cursed. If you have [[half spell damage]] or [[magic resistance]], only 1d3 items will be affected; if you have both, only 1d2 will be affected.{{refsrc|sit.c|337}}

Additionally, despite not being in your inventory, your steed's [[saddle]] has an independent {{frac|4}} chance of being affected, if you're [[riding]] at the time.

[[Magicbane]] will absorb the spell entirely 95% of the time if wielded, protecting all of your items. [[Intelligent artifact]]s will individually resist the effect 80% of the time; this doesn't protect other items.

==Strategy==

While [[container]]s can themselves be cursed by this spell, their contents cannot. But a [[bag of holding]] becomes much heavier if cursed, and using a cursed bag of holding risks destroying some objects inside. Most players using one will learn the {{spell of|remove curse}} spell or carry a blessed [[scroll of remove curse]], potion of [[holy water]], or a [[wand of cancellation]] in an [[oilskin sack]] or a ([[greased]]) plain [[sack]]. A less preferable alternative is to temporarily stow the bag of holding in a non-magical bag while fighting liches&mdash;even if the outer bag gets cursed, the bag of holding will be safe.

To minimize the negative effects of this spell, you can bless even those items in main inventory that are not intrinsically improved by being blessed (such as armor).  Another tactic involves filling up inventory slots with individual items that are light and easily obtainable in large numbers (such as [[arrow]]s, [[dart]]s, and [[gem]]s), each given a different name so that they will not stack together.  Since the cursing effect randomly chooses items from inventory, this reduces the chance that a valuable item will be hit.

If you wield a [[two-handed]] [[weapon]], you should plan ahead in case monsters curse your weapon, e.g., deposit some [[holy water]] in the floor in strategic places. Keep it always blessed and make sure it's safe to pray. If your weapon does become cursed, you can empty your bag on the floor with the #[[tip]] command to reach your means of curse removal; it is best to prepare a bag of such items in advance for when prayer is inconvenient or unavailable (e.g., in [[Gehennom]]).

[[Potion of unholy water#Possible uses|Some items]] are better cursed, and a monster might do you the favor. To use this, you can deliberately get affected by this in a controlled manner. Drop, bag, or stash everything you wouldn't want cursed. Use one of the weaker monsters that can cast this, and confine it into a small space with [[Elbereth]] or [[boulder]]s. You may want to set this up on an early dungeon level, where other generated monsters are less dangerous.

==Non-spell sources==
* [[Pray]]ing: one possible negative effect is a malignant aura.
* The [[Wizard of Yendor]]: Once he is dead or the [[invocation ritual]] has been performed, various [[Wizard of Yendor#Harassment|effects]] will occur at random intervals. One of these effects will curse your items.
* [[Sit]]ting on a [[throne]] with zero or negative [[Luck]] can produce a curse effect.

While failing to read a cursed [[spellbook]] can theoretically result in a malignant aura, this cannot actually happen in vanilla ''[[NetHack]]'' as there is spellbook with a high enough difficulty.

==Messages==

; "You feel as if you need some help."
: The spell was cast by an adjacent monster

or:

; "You notice a black glow surround you."
: The spell was cast remotely by the [[Wizard of Yendor]].
or:

; "A black glow surrounds you."
: The spell is punishment from a god.

If [[blind]], none of the above messages will be displayed. If [[Hallucination|hallucinating]], the color black will be replaced.

Then:

; "You feel a malignant aura surround you."
: Some random inventory items were cursed.

or:

; "You feel a malignant aura surround the magic-absorbing blade."
: The curse was absorbed by [[Magicbane]].

Then, possibly:

; "&lt;artifact&gt; resists!"
: An [[intelligent artifact]] resisted being cursed.  Will be displayed for each resisting artifact.

==UnNetHack==
In [[UnNetHack]], if curse items targets an already-cursed container, one random item inside it is cursed instead. This can theoretically happen recursively if you have nested cursed containers. If you are double-bagging to protect your bag of holding, it is important that the bag containing the bag of holding remains non-cursed.

This spell can be cast by any monster that uses clerical spells. 

==Damage==
This spell will deal (monster's level/2 + 2)d8 damage when cast by a [[high priest]], the [[Grand Master]] or the [[Arch Priest]], and (monster's level/2 + 1)d6 when cast by an [[aligned priest]], [[abbot]], [[acolyte]] or [[Master Kaen]]. {{refsrc|mcastu.c|261}}

The damage can be halved by [[half spell damage]] and by [[magic resistance]]; if you have both, you will only suffer one quarter of the damage (rounded up). 

==Frequency==
Because of the way monsters select their spells, the relative frequency of this spell decreases as the monster's level increases from 1 to 14, but the relative frequency increases as the monster's level increases from 14 to 49.{{refsrc|mcastu.c|128}} Thus, this spell is a favorite of high-level clerical spellcasting monsters (including Master Kaen and high priests).

Spaces can be used normally. <tt><nowiki>{{monsym|fire ant}}</nowiki></tt> shows {{monsym|fire ant}}. The monster names ignore underscores too: <tt><nowiki>{{monsym|fire_ant}}</nowiki></tt> shows {{monsym|fire_ant}} as well.

==Adding new monster symbols==

This template does not, of course, automatically recognize new monsters — every monster has to be input separately. This is, however, a very simple and straight forward task. Adding a new monster called ''foobar'' (whose symbol was a red X, {{red|X}}) would be as easy as creating a sub-page [[Template:Monsym/foobar]] and adding
 <nowiki>{{red|X}}<noinclude>[[Category:Monster symbols|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]</noinclude></nowiki>
as its only content.

&&%s&& %s Template talk:Monsym {42940 2009-08-31T21:56:01Z {924 ZeroOne} /* Disadvantages */ I thought I'd do my civic duty and update [[Genocide]] to use monsym, after seeing that chickatrice was hard coded to be yellow, not brown. It seemed timely to update the page to use Monsym instead and make everyone happy.

After making a couple of tiny changes to this template (monsym can now be used in-line with following text and not carriage return after the symbol, gypsie is now an allowed monster name) I noticed that there is a major issue with either the Wiki itself or this template.

It seems there is a specific limit on the number of times (21?) Monsym or one of it's sub-function (switch? see reasoning below) can be called. I suspect it is a Wiki limit on the number of times a subroutine can be called, but I am not sure. Here's what brought this on and my reasoning:

On the Genocide page, the use of monsym broke after printing perfectly up until the table for use with a blessed croll. After "quadrupeds", the 21st call of Monsym, further use of monsym would break.

The next immediate use of monsym just printed (complete with link) "[[Template:Monsym|#switch:]]", and then every use of monsym after that simply printed a link to [[Template:Monsym]].

* Initially I thought it was simply a missed case or I made a spelling mistake for [[Vampire]], so I changed the template to use vampire_lord, still broken.
* I double checked both entries were in Monsym, still broken.
* I then REMOVED (temporarily) the table entry for Vampires entirely, and the same error immediately passed on to the next table item ([[Zombie]]s) instead. Still broken.
* Restoring Vampire made no difference. I was convinced I was poking more in to the inner workings than I should, so I stopped.

This effect was not expected usage and I didn't know why. I applied judicious use of the Undo function and rolled back my changes to Genocide to use the previous version with the original hard-coded colours. As I don't want to clog things up and only make a half-baked solution (if any), I now seek those with greater wiki-fu to assist. Sorry for the problems with [[Genocide]], and this rambling talk page (I hate not knowing what happened in a wikia error). -- [[User:Kalon|Kalon]] 00:49, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

:Bleh. I should've guessed there would be something like that... It was hard enough finding proper documentation about coding a #switch in the first place. Hopefully there's a solution for it. --[[User:Paxed|Paxed]] 07:03, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
:I just optimized the template a bit; you can now include monsym approximately 34 times per page. This is only approximation, because all the other included Templates also use the same allocation, AFAIK. So, probably 30 times is safe. --[[User:Paxed|Paxed]] 08:26, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
::Some more optimizations; now you can include this template approximately ''200'' times in a page. See [[User:Paxed/Monsymtest]] --[[User:Paxed|Paxed]] 10:07, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

== A note on the version writeups ==

This template should probably not be used on the version writeups (such as [[NetHack 3.4.3|this one]]), because these document specific versions of the game.  Otherwise, a fine bit of coding.--[[User:Ray Chason|Ray Chason]] 03:03, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

== HTML rendering and function calls ==

I have changed the symbol definition for sea monsters (;) and reptiles (:) to use direct HTML coding (&#35;86; and &#35;85; respectively) as they were not displaying properly as they interrupted the function call and caused no symbol to appear and a carriage retunr to be inserted.

The use of direct symbol coding may cause some obscure encoding schema to display incorrect characters or nothing at all, but the majority of users will see what is expected. -- [[User:Kalon|Kalon]] 22:06, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

== Black background gone? ==

When (and why/how) did the black background disappear from the monster symbols? Now white characters (like most humans etc) don't appear on a normal page... -- [[User:Kalon|Kalon]] 04:39, 28 February 2008 (UTC)
* I hate double-posting, but I see that the use of nhsym in common.css has caused this issue, even though the appropiate background: item is included in it... -- [[User:Kalon|Kalon]] 04:49, 28 February 2008 (UTC)
: Your browser was using old, cached version of common.css. --[[User:Paxed|Paxed]] 17:11, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

== Further optimisation of monsym? ==

I've made a prototype of this template that can be used literally thousands of times on a single page (I gave up after a 115k page with 4000 uses). The old one gives out at around 195 in my simple test. The new template's mechanism is quite different; rather than code all the variations in a single template, which is inefficient because of the way the Wiki works, I coded it to include a sub-page which contains just the code for a single monster. This allows the Wiki to do what it is good at, which is look pages up, rather than what it is clearly bad at, resolving multiple complex templates on a single page. (I think it simply substitutes in all the templates first, then works out the result, including any conditionals, on the fully-substituted page!)

Template is at [[User:Rogerb-on-NAO/monsym]]. Because it relies on sub-pages, I created only 2; "Death" and "Gnome king". Use it like this:

<nowiki>{{User:Rogerb-on-NAO/monsym|Death}}</nowiki> gives: {{User:Rogerb-on-NAO/monsym|Death}}

Generalising it would be a "simple" matter of adding the required 300-odd sub-pages.

===Advantages===
*Lightweight; can be used literally thousands of times
*Can be used on pages such as [[Monster]], [[Monsters (by difficulty)]] etc., [[Template:Monsters]], ... which currently need to be hand-edited.
*Retains the key advantage of only having to change one thing if a monster symbol/colour changes
*Can simply overwrite current Template:monsym without causing any issues
*Changing the symbol for one monster won't accidentally affect others

===Disadvantages===
*Uses a lot more pages (but 300-odd doesn't add significantly to our current count, and I recall someone saying somewhere a whole bunch of tiny pages isn't a big load for the wiki).
*Someone needs to create the 300+ sub-pages (maybe a bot could do it?)
*changing multiple monsters will require lots of small edits rather than one big one

What do people think?

::Hiya,
::I just spent a good while trying to figure out how to add a monster symbol. Even though I managed to add a new symbol I still don't understand how the template works -- and I think I'm pretty good with Mediawiki code. Also, I don't know if adding a monster symbol can break something, so I just reverted my edit. So, I'm strongly for taking your method into use. The individual pages can be kept under the namespace of this template, as in [[Template:Monsym/gnome king]], [[Template:Monsym/death]], etc. Adding a monster would then be extremely easy.
::The problem is that I don't know anything about bots but if you can create a bot that would do this automatically then go ahead. As a bureaucrat it won't be a problem for me to arrange bot-rights for a user.
::Also, well, things can be created manually. If we modify [[Template:Monsters]] to have links to the new pages, it should be a breeze.
::Let me know if you are still interested in doing this!

:I did a quick bot run to create the subpages after ZeroOne asked on IRC for help in creating them, and switched the template (and {{tl|monsymlink}}) over to the new syntax.  I did it a little inefficiently, in that I first pulled the titles for the subpages directly from [[User:ZeroOne/Sandbox]] before realizing that they needed some normalization: as a result, for example {{tl|monsym/death}}, {{tl|monsym/Death}} and {{tl|monsym/death (monster)}} are now all redirects to {{tl|monsym/Death (monster)}}.  On the other hand, at least this makes it a bit more convenient to use the subtemplates directly, should someone want to do that.  (It's probably a bit more efficient, but I doubt it makes much difference.)  --[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] 14:49, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

::I'd go with the "{{monsym/werewolf (dog)}}/{{monsym/werewolf (human)}}" syntax you proposed. After all you cannot know which form is being referred to if one only talks about a "werefoo". SLASH'EM monsters introduce a new problem with monsters such as [[werepanther]], it cannot be called "werepanther (dog)" but I guess the straight-forward solution is to call it "werepanther (feline)" -- or to call all werefoo animal forms "werefoo (animal)". &mdash;[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] (<small>[[User talk:ZeroOne|talk]]</small>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<small>[[Special:Emailuser/ZeroOne|@]]</small>) 15:28, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

== Floating TOCs ==

We might want to put the following in common.css to make all TOCs float to right; I think it looks much better than the normal behaviour where the Table of Contents is in the normal page flow
 #toc { float: right; }
--[[User:Paxed|Paxed]] 11:40, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:Purple spellbook.png|right|A purple spellbook that floats to the right of this page.]]
: I would like this idea. (Back when [[Wikinfo:Main Page|Wikinfo]] used [[Wikinfo:GetWiki|GetWiki]], the TOCs floated right and that was nice.) But I think there might be problems on pages that already have infoboxes (especially the enormous [[Template:Monster]]) at top and right. These infobox templates might occupy the space that the TOC would use.
: So instead I suggest that editors use <tt><nowiki><div class="floatright">__TOC__</div></nowiki></tt> on individual pages when they want the TOC to float right. This borrows the CSS that MediaWiki normally uses to float images right. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:39, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

== Better formatting of Template:ASCII ==

<s>[Template:ASCII]] looks better if the table elements are in a monospace font; this makes all characters equally clickable, and naturally makes the columns even width.

Rather than add style="font-family: monospace;" to each cell, I would like to use CSS to do this.

I have added the style "asciitable" to the template. Adding the following to my local CSS achieves the desired effect:

 table.asciitable td {font-family: monospace;}

Please could this be added to the global CSS, unless someone has a better method to achieve this?

== Interline gaps in ttymaps ==

There's a small problem with the line spacing in ttymaps: it leaves gaps between line drawing characters on one line and those on the next. See, for example, [[Template:Random_ttymap/ttymap2]]:

{{Random_ttymap/ttymap2}}

I'm seeing this in both Google Chrome version "11.0.696.44 beta" and Internet Explorer 8; I expect Firefox is the same, but I've already got 2.5x stuff loaded as can fit in RAM, so I haven't actually tried it.

I tried disabling all the applicable "line-height" rules, but that doesn't seem to actually help, and with some combinations of enabledness I even get white bands between lines! I begin to doubt that there is a way to fix this within current CSS standards. &mdash;[[User:SamB|SamB]] 22:45, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

== When background is explicitly set, foreground must also be ==

For compatibility with user CSS or browser-plugins that enable "night mode" or other browser-plugins for users with poor vision, this kind of css is bad:
http://i.imgur.com/1tGxc5R.png

It results in things that look like this:
http://i.imgur.com/lOZmXuw.png

So like this thing?

<nowiki>/* [[Template:Bugstatus]] */
.bugstatus.open { background:red; }
.bugstatus.fixed { background:lightgreen; }
.bugstatus.nextversion { background:green; }
.bugstatus.help { background:yellow; }
.bugstatus.not_a_bug { background:lightblue; }
.bugstatus.superseded {}
 
.table-yes { background: lightgreen; }
.table-no { background: pink; }
.table-partial { background: #FFF68F; } /* yellowish */</nowiki>

All those backgrounds need to also have a foreground set. Probably to black, or #252525 which seems to be the default "black" used on the wiki.

This template shows the monster symbol and puts a link to that monster's page after it. Takes one or two parameters, the monster name, and an optional link type, which can be either <tt>before</tt>, <tt>after</tt>, or <tt>only</tt>. Uses <tt>before</tt> as the default type if the second parameter is missing. If you need a simplified version that only shows the monster symbol as a link, use {{tl|msl}}.

For example:

*<nowiki>{{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor}}</nowiki> produces {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor}}
*<nowiki>{{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor|before}}</nowiki> produces {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor|before}}
*<nowiki>{{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor|after}}</nowiki> produces {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor|after}}
*<nowiki>{{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor|only}}</nowiki> produces {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor|only}}

To specify a specific variant without adding this to the link text, specify the <tt>variant</tt> parameter, for example:

* <nowiki>{{monsymlink|Cthulhu|variant=UnNetHack}}</nowiki> produces {{monsymlink|Cthulhu|variant=UnNetHack}}
* <nowiki>{{monsymlink|Cthulhu|variant=SLASH'EM}}</nowiki> produces {{monsymlink|Cthulhu|variant=SLASH'EM}}

This is intended for use in articles or sections that are obviously about a specific variant, for example linking to [[Cthulhu]] in the [[UnNetHack]] article.
