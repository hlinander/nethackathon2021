* [[potion of blindness]]
* [[potion of booze]]
* [[potion of confusion]]
* [[potion of extra healing]]
* [[potion of fruit juice]]
* [[Potion of gain ability|potion of gain strength]]
* [[potion of gain level]]
* [[potion of healing]]
* [[potion of invisibility]]
* [[potion of levitation]]
* [[potion of monster detection]]
* [[potion of object detection]]
* [[potion of paralysis]]
* [[Potion of restore ability|potion of restore strength]]
* [[potion of sickness]]
* [[potion of speed]]

=== Scrolls ===

Scrolls in Hack 1.0.1 are:

* [[scroll of amnesia]]
* [[scroll of blank paper]]
* [[scroll of confuse monster]]
* [[scroll of create monster]]
* scroll of damage weapon
* [[scroll of destroy armor]]
* [[scroll of enchant armor]]
* [[scroll of enchant weapon]]
* [[scroll of fire]]
* [[scroll of food detection]]
* [[scroll of genocide]]
* [[scroll of gold detection]]
* [[scroll of identify]]
* [[scroll of light]]
* [[scroll of magic mapping]]
* [[scroll of punishment]]
* [[scroll of remove curse]]
* [[scroll of scare monster]]
* [[scroll of taming]]
* [[scroll of teleportation]]

The scroll of damage weapon acts as the modern scroll of enchant weapon does when [[curse]]d.  The scroll of genocide acts, in all cases, as the modern blessed scroll; but most symbols refer to only one monster anyway.

=== Wands ===

Wands in Hack 1.0.1 are:

* [[wand of cancellation]]
* [[wand of cold]]
* [[wand of create monster]]
* [[wand of death]]
* [[wand of digging]]
* [[wand of fire]]
* [[wand of light]]
* [[wand of magic missile]]
* [[wand of make invisible]]
* [[wand of polymorph]]
* [[wand of secret door detection]]
* [[wand of sleep]]
* [[wand of slow monster]]
* [[wand of speed monster]]
* [[wand of striking]]
* [[Wand of teleportation|wand of teleport monster]]
* [[wand of undead turning]]
* [[wand of wishing]]

=== Rings ===

Rings in Hack 1.0.1 are:

* [[ring of adornment]]
* [[ring of aggravate monster]]
* [[ring of cold resistance]]
* [[ring of conflict]]
* [[ring of fire resistance]]
* [[ring of gain strength]]
* [[ring of hunger]]
* [[ring of increase damage]]
* [[ring of levitation]]
* [[ring of poison resistance]]
* [[ring of protection from shape changers]]
* [[ring of protection]]
* [[ring of regeneration]]
* [[ring of searching]]
* [[ring of see invisible]]
* [[ring of stealth]]
* [[ring of teleport control]]
* [[ring of teleportation]]
* [[ring of warning]]

Because [[charisma]] does not exist in Hack 1.0.1, the ring of adornment is a useless item.

=== Gems ===

Gems in Hack 1.0.1 are:

* [[agate stone]]
* [[amethyst stone]]
* [[aquamarine stone]]
* [[diamond]]
* [[emerald]]
* [[garnet stone]]
* [[jade stone]]
* [[jasper stone]]
* [[onyx stone]]
* [[opal stone]]
* [[ruby]]
* [[sapphire]]
* [[topaz stone]]
* [[tourmaline stone]]
* [[turquoise stone]]

and worthless pieces of blue, red, yellow, and green glass.

=== Other items ===

Other items not appearing in the above categories are:

* [[heavy iron ball]]
* [[iron chain]]
* [[Boulder|enormous rock]]

It is not possible to pick up an iron chain, nor can they be generated from [[iron golem]]s, because these do not exist in Hack 1.0.1.

== Derivative versions ==

Hack 1.0.1 inspired two ports to other operating systems, [[PC Hack 1.0.1]] and [[AmigaHack 1.0.1]].

&&%s&& %s Hack 1.0.2 {128597 2019-10-12T22:23:41Z {679 Ray Chason} /* Availability */ Fix a broken link to part 2 {{NetHack Versions}}

'''Hack 1.0.2''' is the third public release of [[Hack]].  [[Andries Brouwer]] published it to the (now-obsolete) [[Usenet]] newsgroup net.sources.games in April 1985.

== Availability ==

Google Groups has archived nine of the ten original postings to net.sources.games, but not part 2.  This is possibly due to the same problem with the rumors file which affected part 15 of [[Hack 1.0]]:

* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/q2qZ39dMGOQ/6mmwYjMIRLkJ Part 1]
* ''Part 2 is missing [https://web.archive.org/web/20060505171210/http://vmsone.com/~decuslib/unixsig/uni87a/hack/part2. (second archive)]''
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/7OyHZBMS9Pc/zFi2aCjUa_oJ Part 3]
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/f6Ras65IYTM/5IdNvQK1TA8J Part 4]
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/7tDpSMKz5nQ/Ea4ce16GPacJ Part 5]
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/SPfxgd91Y1I/_T9S-m6yh4cJ Part 6]
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/qJYA0JzIMo4/b1Rr2jUG0xUJ Part 7]
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/Vt3_cnKQCZ4/FpwMudSxVqoJ Part 8]
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/OwJkPfAtO7I/W6tf8Ce0x6oJ Part 9]
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/i39uwS_8QPQ/hI8TvbuEBFYJ Part 10] (including ed commands, see below)

These are mostly typical shar files.  Part 10 is a bit different in that, after extracting its contents, it invokes ed to patch some of the files from previous parts.

A [http://www.digiater.nl/openvms/decus/uni87a/hack/ second archive] also preserves Hack 1.0.2.  Part 2 appears to be intact in this archive, but parts 1 and 8 are somewhat altered, most notably changing the [[wizard mode]] account to "kimery".  [ftp://ftp.mrynet.com/operatingsystems/DEC/vmsone/vmsone.com/~decuslib/unixsig/uni87a/hack/index.html%3FS%3DD Mrynet.com] has another copy of the second archive of Hack 1.0.2.  Andries Brouwer has mirrored both archives on his [http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/games/hack/hack.html web site].

[[Ali Harlow]][http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/front.html] has a Hack 1.0.2 distribution at [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/source/ab_hack-1.0.2.tar.gz].  This distribution does not have the benefit of the second archive.

== Significant changes ==

* The player may now choose to play as female.
* The [[wizard of Yendor]], [[giant eel]], [[hell hound]], and [[mail daemon]] join the bestiary.
* The first [[phase of the moon]] effects are introduced:
** Cockatrice hissing always stones at new moon unless the adventurer is carrying a [[lizard corpse|dead lizard]].
** Full moon boosts luck by one point.
** Attempting to [[pet|tame]] a [[dog]] at full moon usually fails.
** Dogs and hell hounds attacking at full moon do extra damage.
* The [[lump of royal jelly]], [[scroll of mail]], [[pick-axe]], and [[can opener]] join the object list.
* New room types are [[swamp]], [[beehive]], and [[crypt]]. [[Zoo|Treasure zoos]] are no longer affected by a login name of "david".
* [[Pool]]s appear for the first time.
* Dungeon level 30 and deeper require [[fire resistance]] to enter. (See [[Hell]]).
* The "mklev" program, used in earlier versions to create the level files, is merged into the main binary.

The swamp and the giant eel are drawn from [[PDP-11 Hack]] and the Hack 1.0.2 source credits the creators of that version, Michiel Huisjes and Fred de Wilde, for the inspiration.

== The adventurer ==

The player may choose a [[Tourist]], a [[Archeologist|Speleologist]], a [[Barbarian|Fighter]],
a [[Knight]], a [[Caveman|Cave-(wo)man]], or a [[Wizard]].  All classes permit male and female adventurers.

The adventurer has [[experience]], [[hit points]], [[armor class]], and [[strength]].  He may advance to [[experience level]] 14.

The initial [[pet]] is a little [[dog]].

== Dungeon features ==

The dungeon in Hack 1.0.2 has no branches; there is one way up and one way down.  The first 25 levels or so consist of rooms, and beyond that, the adventurer encounters mazes.

Dungeon level 30 and deeper are designated as "[[Hell]]".  Entering hell without fire resistance is an [[instadeath]].  Due to a bug, fixed in [[Hack 1.0.3]], one could enter hell with a [[ring of fire resistance]] and take it off once there.  ([[Gremlin]]s and self-[[polymorph]] did not yet exist.)

Special rooms are [[shop]]s, [[beehive]]s, [[crypt]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[treasure zoo]]s, and [[vault]]s.

Traps are:

* [[bear trap]]
* [[arrow trap]]
* [[dart trap]]
* [[trapdoor]]
* [[teleportation trap]]
* [[pit]]
* [[sleeping gas trap]]

The [[Amulet of Yendor]] is found in the posession of the [[wizard of Yendor]] in a maze level.  He is in a small room in the center of a maze level, surrounded by water and accompanied by a [[hell hound]].

Other maze levels have [[wand of wishing|wands of wishing]] tucked under a boulder in a dead-end square.  (Yes, there's more than one.)  Since [[NetHack 3.1.0]], one version of [[Medusa]]'s lair has a random wand in a similar spot, commemorating the former location of the wand of wishing.

== Bestiary ==

Monsters that are new to this version are noted in boldface.

== Objects ==

New objects to this version are indicated in boldface.

=== Artifacts ===

Hack 1.0.2 has only one [[artifact]], [[Orcrist]].  Any [[two handed sword]] may be named Orcrist and will do d10 extra points damage to [[orc]]s.  There can even be more than one Orcrist.

=== Amulets ===

Only the [[Amulet of Yendor]] and the cheap plastic imitation exist in Hack 1.0.2.

=== Food ===

Food items in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[food ration]]
* [[tripe ration]]
* [[pancake]]
* [[lizard corpse|dead lizard]]
* [[fortune cookie]]
* [[carrot]]
* [[tin]]
* [[orange]]
* [[apple]]
* [[pear]]
* [[melon]]
* [[banana]]
* [[candy bar]]
* [[egg]]
* [[clove of garlic]]
* '''[[lump of royal jelly]]'''
* [[corpse]] (called ''dead foo'' rather than ''foo corpse'')

The tin did not contain the remains of monsters, but rather a randomly-chosen food such as peaches or, if the adventurer is lucky, [[spinach]].

The dead lizard was a found object rather than a corpse; live lizards did not exist in Hack 1.0.2.  It could reduce [[confusion]] and carrying it cancelled the effects of the [[phase of the moon|new moon]], but had no effect on [[stoning]] as this was still an [[instadeath]].

=== Weapons ===

Weapons in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[arrow]]
* sling bullet
* [[crossbow bolt]]
* [[dart]]
* [[rock]]
* [[boomerang]]
* [[mace]]
* [[axe]]
* [[flail]]
* [[long sword]]
* [[two-handed sword|two handed sword]]
* [[dagger]]
* [[worm tooth]]
* [[crysknife]]
* [[spear]]
* [[bow]]
* [[sling]]
* [[crossbow]]

=== Tools ===

Tools in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[tin whistle|whistle]]
* [[magic whistle]]
* [[expensive camera]]
* [[ice box]]
* '''[[pick-axe]]'''
* '''[[tin opener|can opener]]'''

The ice box is the only container.  Then as now, it preserved corpses, and was generally too heavy (and too rare) to be useful for inventory management.

=== Armor ===

Armor items in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[helmet]]
* [[plate mail]]
* [[splint mail]]
* [[banded mail]]
* [[chain mail]]
* [[scale mail]]
* [[ring mail]]
* [[studded leather armor]]
* [[leather armor]]
* [[elven cloak]]
* [[shield]]
* [[leather gloves|pair of gloves]]

=== Potions ===

Potions in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[Potion of restore ability|potion of restore strength]]
* [[potion of booze]]
* [[potion of invisibility]]
* [[potion of fruit juice]]
* [[potion of healing]]
* [[potion of paralysis]]
* [[potion of monster detection]]
* [[potion of object detection]]
* [[potion of sickness]]
* [[potion of confusion]]
* [[Potion of gain ability|potion of gain strength]]
* [[potion of speed]]
* [[potion of blindness]]
* [[potion of gain level]]
* [[potion of extra healing]]
* [[potion of levitation]]

=== Scrolls ===

Scrolls in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* '''[[scroll of mail]]''' (if MAIL defined at compile time)
* [[scroll of enchant armor]]
* [[scroll of destroy armor]]
* [[scroll of confuse monster]]
* [[scroll of scare monster]]
* [[scroll of blank paper]]
* [[scroll of remove curse]]
* [[scroll of enchant weapon]]
* scroll of damage weapon
* [[scroll of create monster]]
* [[scroll of taming]]
* [[scroll of genocide]]
* [[scroll of light]]
* [[scroll of teleportation]]
* [[scroll of gold detection]]
* [[scroll of food detection]]
* [[scroll of identify]]
* [[scroll of magic mapping]]
* [[scroll of amnesia]]
* [[scroll of fire]]
* [[scroll of punishment]]

The scroll of damage weapon acts as the modern scroll of enchant weapon does when [[curse]]d.  The scroll of genocide acts, in all cases, as the modern blessed scroll; but most symbols refer to only one monster anyway.

=== Wands ===

Wands in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[wand of light]]
* [[wand of secret door detection]]
* [[wand of create monster]]
* [[wand of wishing]]
* [[wand of striking]]
* [[wand of slow monster]]
* [[wand of speed monster]]
* [[wand of undead turning]]
* [[wand of polymorph]]
* [[wand of cancellation]]
* [[wand of teleportation]] ''(formerly "wand of teleport monster")''
* [[wand of make invisible]]
* [[wand of digging]]
* [[wand of magic missile]]
* [[wand of fire]]
* [[wand of sleep]]
* [[wand of cold]]
* [[wand of death]]

=== Rings ===

Rings in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[ring of adornment]]
* [[ring of teleportation]]
* [[ring of regeneration]]
* [[ring of searching]]
* [[ring of see invisible]]
* [[ring of stealth]]
* [[ring of levitation]]
* [[ring of poison resistance]]
* [[ring of aggravate monster]]
* [[ring of hunger]]
* [[ring of fire resistance]]
* [[ring of cold resistance]]
* [[ring of protection from shape changers]]
* [[ring of conflict]]
* [[ring of gain strength]]
* [[ring of increase damage]]
* [[ring of protection]]
* [[ring of warning]]
* [[ring of teleport control]]

Because [[charisma]] does not exist in Hack 1.0.2, the ring of adornment is a useless item.

=== Gems ===

Gems in Hack 1.0.2 are:

* [[diamond]]
* [[ruby]]
* [[sapphire]]
* [[emerald]]
* [[turquoise stone]]
* [[aquamarine stone]]
* [[tourmaline stone]]
* [[topaz stone]]
* [[opal stone]]
* [[garnet stone]]
* [[amethyst stone]]
* [[agate stone]]
* [[onyx stone]]
* [[jasper stone]]
* [[jade stone]]

and worthless pieces of blue, red, yellow, and green glass.

=== Other items ===

Other items not appearing in the above categories are:

* [[heavy iron ball]]
* [[iron chain]]
* [[Boulder|enormous rock]]

It is not possible to pick up an iron chain, nor can they be generated from [[iron golem]]s, because these do not exist in Hack 1.0.2.

&&%s&& %s Hack 1.0.3 {130123 2020-01-05T02:46:21Z {4001290 Lysdexia} /* Legacy */ {{NetHack Versions}}

'''Hack 1.0.3''' is the fourth public release of [[Hack]].  [[Andries Brouwer]] published it to the (now-obsolete) [[Usenet]] newsgroup net.sources.games in July 1985. This version continues to be widely available today because of its inclusion in the *[[BSD]] operating systems.

== Availability ==

Hack 1.0.3 was distributed as a [[patch]] against [[Hack 1.0.2]].  This was presented as an "ed script", a method of distributing patches that is now obsolete.

Google Groups has archived [https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=net.sources.games/lT3bbAeW-Nw/SUbuQGzDH9kJ the patch].

Andries Brouwer[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/games/hack/hack.html] has a Hack 1.0.3 distribution at [http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/games/hack/hack-1.0.3.tar.gz].

[[Ali Harlow]][http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/front.html] has a Hack 1.0.3 distribution at [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/source/ab_hack-1.0.3.tar.gz].

=== In *BSD ===

* [[DragonFly BSD]]: they have Hack, Rogue, and Larn in their CVS, is it also on their installation CD?
* [[FreeBSD]]: install [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/games/freebsd-games/ games/freebsd-games] from ports; this gives you several traditional BSD games including Hack, Rogue, and Larn.
* [[NetBSD]]: include "games.tgz" when installing the base operating system; this gives you several traditional BSD games including Hack, Rogue, and Larn.
* [[OpenBSD]]: include "gamesXX.tgz" (where XX is the version number, as in games39.tgz for OpenBSD 3.9) when installing the base operating system. This gives you some traditional BSD games, including Hack 1.0.3, but neither Rogue or Larn. OpenBSD has audited their source code and removed Rogue and Larn for being less than [[free]] software.

=== Others ===

* [http://www.debian.org Debian]: 'apt-get install bsdgames' ([https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/bsdgames HTTP interface]); this gives you "all of the games in NetBSD-current are free in the usual (DFSG/OSD) sense". Rogue is in 'bsdgames-nonfree' ([https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/bsdgames-nonfree HTTP interface]), Larn is not distributed at all, both for license reasons.

== Significant changes ==

* Means are provided to avoid bugs and limitations on certain systems.
* [[Wizard mode]] appears for the first time.
* Inventory letters can be kept constant at the user's option.
* [[Curse]]d weapons are handled more consistently.
* A real [[amulet of Yendor]] can no longer be found in bones files.
* An adventurer who walks into a [[pool]] has a chance to teleport to safety.
* A #[[pray]] command exists, but is not functional (it just immobilizes you for a couple of turns).
* Removing a [[ring of fire resistance]] while in hell leads to [[YASD]] unless naturally [[fire resistance|fire resistant]].
* [[Acid blob]]s no longer spoil.
* [[Stoning]] is now gradual, and can be cured by eating a [[lizard corpse|dead lizard]] or [[acid blob]].
* The dead lizard no longer affects [[confusion]].
* [[Invisibility]] is handled more consistently.
* Smoky potions may release a [[ghost]] (not a [[djinni]], as these do not yet exist).
* [[Shopkeeper]]s take exception to digging through the floor in a [[shop]].
* Support for System V UNIX as well as BSD.

== The adventurer ==

The player may choose a [[Tourist]], a [[Archeologist|Speleologist]], a [[Barbarian|Fighter]],
a [[Knight]], a [[Caveman|Cave-(wo)man]], or a [[Wizard]].  All classes permit male and female adventurers.

The adventurer has [[experience]], [[hit points]], [[armor class]], and [[strength]].  He may advance to [[experience level]] 14.

The initial [[pet]] is a little [[dog]].

== Dungeon features ==

The dungeon in Hack 1.0.3 has no branches; there is one way up and one way down.  The first 25 levels or so consist of rooms, and beyond that, the adventurer encounters mazes.  The deepest dungeon level is 40.

Dungeon level 30 and deeper are designated as "[[Hell]]".  Entering hell without [[fire resistance]], or losing it once there, is an [[instadeath]].  As [[gremlin]]s and self-[[polymorph]] do not exist in this version, the only way to lose fire resistance is to take off the [[ring of fire resistance|ring]].  These levels have only up-stairs, and the only way to enter is by [[level teleportation]].

Special rooms are [[shop]]s, [[beehive]]s, [[crypt]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[treasure zoo]]s, and [[vault]]s.

Traps are:

* [[bear trap]]
* [[arrow trap]]
* [[dart trap]]
* [[trapdoor]]
* [[teleportation trap]]
* [[pit]]
* [[sleeping gas trap]]

The [[Amulet of Yendor]] is found in the posession of the [[wizard of Yendor]] in a maze level.  He is in a small room in the center of a maze level, surrounded by water and accompanied by a [[hell hound]].

Other maze levels have [[wand of wishing|wands of wishing]] tucked under a boulder in a dead-end square.  (Yes, there's more than one.)  Since [[NetHack 3.1.0]], one version of [[Medusa]]'s lair has a random wand in a similar spot, commemorating the former location of the wand of wishing.

Hack 1.0.3 introduces no new monsters.

== Objects ==

Hack 1.0.3 introduces no new objects.

=== Artifacts ===

Hack 1.0.3 has only one [[artifact]], [[Orcrist]].  Any [[two handed sword]] may be named Orcrist and will do d10 extra points damage to [[orc]]s.  There can even be more than one Orcrist.

=== Amulets ===

Only the [[Amulet of Yendor]] and the cheap plastic imitation exist in Hack 1.0.3.

=== Food ===

Food items in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[food ration]]
* [[tripe ration]]
* [[pancake]]
* [[lizard corpse|dead lizard]]
* [[fortune cookie]]
* [[carrot]]
* [[tin]]
* [[orange]]
* [[apple]]
* [[pear]]
* [[melon]]
* [[banana]]
* [[candy bar]]
* [[egg]]
* [[clove of garlic]]
* [[lump of royal jelly]]
* [[corpse]] (called ''dead foo'' rather than ''foo corpse'')

The tin did not contain the remains of monsters, but rather a randomly-chosen food such as peaches or, if the adventurer is lucky, [[spinach]].

The dead lizard was a found object rather than a corpse; live lizards did not exist in Hack 1.0.3.    It otherwise had its modern properties in this version.

=== Weapons ===

Weapons in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[arrow]]
* sling bullet
* [[crossbow bolt]]
* [[dart]]
* [[rock]]
* [[boomerang]]
* [[mace]]
* [[axe]]
* [[flail]]
* [[long sword]]
* [[two-handed sword|two handed sword]]
* [[dagger]]
* [[worm tooth]]
* [[crysknife]]
* [[spear]]
* [[bow]]
* [[sling]]
* [[crossbow]]

=== Tools ===

Tools in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[tin whistle|whistle]]
* [[magic whistle]]
* [[expensive camera]]
* [[ice box]]
* [[pick-axe]]
* [[tin opener|can opener]]

The ice box is the only container.  Then as now, it preserved corpses, and was generally too heavy (and too rare) to be useful for inventory management.

=== Armor ===

Armor items in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[helmet]]
* [[plate mail]]
* [[splint mail]]
* [[banded mail]]
* [[chain mail]]
* [[scale mail]]
* [[ring mail]]
* [[studded leather armor]]
* [[leather armor]]
* [[elven cloak]]
* [[shield]]
* [[leather gloves|pair of gloves]]

=== Potions ===

Potions in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[Potion of restore ability|potion of restore strength]]
* [[potion of booze]]
* [[potion of invisibility]]
* [[potion of fruit juice]]
* [[potion of healing]]
* [[potion of paralysis]]
* [[potion of monster detection]]
* [[potion of object detection]]
* [[potion of sickness]]
* [[potion of confusion]]
* [[Potion of gain ability|potion of gain strength]]
* [[potion of speed]]
* [[potion of blindness]]
* [[potion of gain level]]
* [[potion of extra healing]]
* [[potion of levitation]]

=== Scrolls ===

Scrolls in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[scroll of mail]] (unconditional, even though mail daemon is dependent on MAIL)
* [[scroll of enchant armor]]
* [[scroll of destroy armor]]
* [[scroll of confuse monster]]
* [[scroll of scare monster]]
* [[scroll of blank paper]]
* [[scroll of remove curse]]
* [[scroll of enchant weapon]]
* scroll of damage weapon
* [[scroll of create monster]]
* [[scroll of taming]]
* [[scroll of genocide]]
* [[scroll of light]]
* [[scroll of teleportation]]
* [[scroll of gold detection]]
* [[scroll of food detection]]
* [[scroll of identify]]
* [[scroll of magic mapping]]
* [[scroll of amnesia]]
* [[scroll of fire]]
* [[scroll of punishment]]

The scroll of damage weapon acts as the modern scroll of enchant weapon does when [[curse]]d.  The scroll of genocide acts, in all cases, as the modern blessed scroll; but most symbols refer to only one monster anyway.

=== Wands ===

Wands in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[wand of light]]
* [[wand of secret door detection]]
* [[wand of create monster]]
* [[wand of wishing]]
* [[wand of striking]]
* [[wand of slow monster]]
* [[wand of speed monster]]
* [[wand of undead turning]]
* [[wand of polymorph]]
* [[wand of cancellation]]
* [[wand of teleportation]]
* [[wand of make invisible]]
* [[wand of digging]]
* [[wand of magic missile]]
* [[wand of fire]]
* [[wand of sleep]]
* [[wand of cold]]
* [[wand of death]]

=== Rings ===

Rings in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[ring of adornment]]
* [[ring of teleportation]]
* [[ring of regeneration]]
* [[ring of searching]]
* [[ring of see invisible]]
* [[ring of stealth]]
* [[ring of levitation]]
* [[ring of poison resistance]]
* [[ring of aggravate monster]]
* [[ring of hunger]]
* [[ring of fire resistance]]
* [[ring of cold resistance]]
* [[ring of protection from shape changers]]
* [[ring of conflict]]
* [[ring of gain strength]]
* [[ring of increase damage]]
* [[ring of protection]]
* [[ring of warning]]
* [[ring of teleport control]]

Because [[charisma]] does not exist in Hack 1.0.3, the ring of adornment is a useless item.

=== Gems ===

Gems in Hack 1.0.3 are:

* [[diamond]]
* [[ruby]]
* [[sapphire]]
* [[emerald]]
* [[turquoise stone]]
* [[aquamarine stone]]
* [[tourmaline stone]]
* [[topaz stone]]
* [[opal stone]]
* [[garnet stone]]
