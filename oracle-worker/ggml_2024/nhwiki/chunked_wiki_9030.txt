A '''balrog''', {{monsym|balrog}}, is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is the most physically imposing of the non-unique [[major demon]]s, and has [[fly|flight]], [[fire resistance]] and [[poison resistance]].

Unlike most other major demons, balrogs are incapable of [[Gating|summoning other demons]]; they share this property with [[foocubi]]. 

==Generation==
Balrogs are only randomly generated in [[Gehennom]] normally, but are also a valid form for [[polymorph]]. They are eligible to summon via gating by other major demons, including [[demon lords and princes]]. A balrog is guaranteed to appear on the [[Plane of Fire]].{{refsrc|dat/endgame.des|82|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

All balrogs [[monster starting inventory|are armed with]] a [[bullwhip|whip]] and [[broadsword]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|489|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Balrogs are easily among the more intimidating threats in Gehennom, with a solid base [[AC]] of -2, powerful weapon attacks and high [[Magic resistance (monster)|monster magic resistance]] - they also have no [[Monster spell|spellcasting]] or gating ability, and are very slow. For balrogs in their natural habitat, players are likely to have good AC themselves by this point, along with any combination of at least one [[silver]] weapon, a source of cold damage, and [[fast]] or better speed; balrogs that are the result of early [[polymorph trap]]s can be a nasty unexpected surprised and possibly spell doom for an unlucky player.

Balrogs are capable of disarming you or even stealing your weapon with their bullwhip, making them especially dangerous if you are relying on your wielded weapon for certain intrinsics (e.g. [[Excalibur]] for [[drain resistance]] and [[Magicbane]] for [[Magicbane]] - but unlike a [[horned devil]], the balrog will only wield the bullwhip if it somehow loses its broadsword, due to [[Pet#Weapons|the way monsters prioritize weapons]].

===As a pet===
Balrogs are among the best choices for a pet that are obtainable from a polymorph trap. In addition to the above qualities, balrogs are also [[inediate]] and [[strong]], and their flight lets them easily avoid traps and cross [[moat]]s. A properly equipped balrog is a handy [[Stealing from shops|shop-raiding pet]] that can steamroll through [[shopkeepers]], and their strength also makes them good for [[credit cloning]]. Their high monster MR does mean that they will often resist a [[wand of speed monster]] unless they zap it at themselves, and their very low speed makes it less effective for them. Balrogs can only wear boots and gloves, though their natural AC will make up for most of the unusable armor slots.

Balrogs are rivaled in terms of pet quality and popularity by [[Archons]] and [[titan]]s: Archons are considered better due to their spellcasting and easier to manage, but can usually only be obtained as a pet by [[wish]]ing for a blessed [[figurine]] of one; titans are also spellcasters that can be created by polytraps as well, but are not inediate and must be kept well-fed. Balrogs are more available in comparison to both - demon gating in particular is available to players that polymorph into other major demons - but they are still somewhat difficult to obtain, and a player will need to actively keep their pet balrog's health up. 

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}
The balrog originates from the [[wikipedia:Middle-earth|legendarium]] of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s Middle-Earth setting; one first appeared in print in his high fantasy novel ''[[wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings|The Lord of the Rings]]'', where the Fellowship of the Ring encounter one in the [[Ruins of Moria|Mines of Moria]], and others appear in ''[[wikipedia:The Silmarillion|The Silmarillion]]'' among other books. Balrogs are tall and menacing, and can shroud themselves in fire, darkness and shadow - they are armed with fiery whips "of many thongs" and occasionally use long swords, which correspond to the bullwhip and broadsword they receive in ''NetHack''; in ''The Silmarillion'', and some of Tolkien's earlier writings also mention steel claws and iron mail.

Balrogs were only rivaled by dragons in their capacity for ferocity and destruction. Early writings portrayed them as numerous and roughly twice the size of human, and they were occasionally killed in battle by Elves and Men; they served as fiery demonic servants of Morgoth, armed with fiery whips of many thongs and claws like steel. Later Balrogs were far more sinister and powerful, owing to their origins as formerly-divine Maiar that were corrupted by Melkor before the World's creation, and could not be as readily vanquished. One example of the later Balrogs is fought by Gandalf and the Fellowship at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, and is known as [[Durin's Bane]]; it is the model for all other Balrogs that appear in ''NetHack'' and other fantasy works, and the [[encyclopedia]] entry is an excerpt from their encounter with it in the books.

Durin's Bane was a survivor of the War of Wrath that escaped the defeat of Morgoth and hid at the base of a mountain within Khazad-dûm. It earned its name from killing the Dwarf-King of Khazad-dûm, Durin VI, when it was found by a troop of [[mithril]]-mining [[dwarves]] that had dug too deep. Durin's Bane was exceptionally powerful and endowed with magical prowess, even nearly felling the powerful wizard Gandalf; it used a flaming sword ("From out of the shadow a red sword leapt flaming") and a many-thonged whip that "whined and cracked", and appears "like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater". When Gandalf eventually defeat the monster and throws it from a mountain peak, it "broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin".

==Variants==
Several variants include the Orc Temple variant of [[Mines' End]] created by Khor, which features a cursed figurine of a balrog - the engravings in the temple refer to it as "Dagul", and the figurine itself is seated on an altar to [[Moloch]] that is surrounded by [[squeaky board]] traps and hidden in a room surrounded by lava. The room itself is only accessible via a well-hidden secret passageway.

===SLASH'EM===
In SLASH'EM, balrogs may turn [[traitor]] when tame. A balrog named Njalnohaar appears as an assistant monster in [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|the black market]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], [[Durin's Bane]] is a unique balrog with somewhat higher stats and better equipment that appears on the second floor of the [[Ruins of Moria]] branch.

The [[Black market (UnNetHack)|black market in UnNetHack]] also features the same balrog assistant in the map borrowed from SLASH'EM.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], [[Durin's Bane#dNetHack|Durin's Bane]] is the [[quest nemesis]] for the [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarven]] [[Noble]], and is much more powerful compared to its appearance in UnNetHack.

===The November NetHack Tournament===
In [[The November NetHack Tournament]], a statue of a balrog named "The RNG" appears in [[the DevTeam Office]].

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], balrogs are given a new item to replace their bullwhips in the [[flaming lash]]. The [[Black market (SpliceHack)|black market]] in [[SpliceHack]] also features the same balrog assistant in the map borrowed from SLASH'EM.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], balrogs are stronger and faster, and their broadsword and bullwhip are frequently enchanted - both weapons also have the fire [[object property]]. Bullwhips are also placed ahead of broadswords in monster weapon preference, ensuring that balrogs wield their bullwhips.

A balrog guards the hidden treasure room in the [[Valley of the Dead]], and another appears in the eastern part of the Stronghold of [[Kas]] within [[Vecna's Domain]]. One of the [[Fake Wizard's Tower]] maps has a {{frac|2}} chance to contain a balrog within the tower - the other map places a guaranteed balrog and [[vampire royal]] in its tower.

Two [[artifact]]s are associated with balrogs: [[Dramborleg]] is a mithril [[dwarvish bearded axe]] that instantly annihilates any balrog it hits, while [[Angelslayer]] is an unaligned trident that has a {{frac|20}} chance of being generated on a balrog.

...  It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as
if a cloud had bent over it.  Then with a rush it leaped
the fissure.  The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed
about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air.  Its streaming

was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it
held a whip of many thongs.
'Ai, ai!' wailed Legolas.  'A Balrog!  A Balrog is come!'

'''Geryon''', {{monsym|geryon}}, is one of the [[demon prince]]s. He is one of three not to have his own lair (the other two being [[Dispater]] and [[Demogorgon]]), and therefore is not guaranteed to appear; he will only arrive via [[demon summoning]] or a monster casting [[summon nasties]] in Gehennom.

He will start out peaceful (unless you have [[Excalibur]]), and ask for payment.

{{wikipedia|Geryon}}
==Strategy==
Due to his low speed, most players should be able to kill him without taking damage.

==Origin==

Geryon is derived from a [[Dungeons and Dragons]] demon, which is in turn derived from an ancient Greek monster.

The ancient Greek sources about his appearance are inconsistent with regards to numbers of heads, bodies, and limbs. The D&D version has a snake-like body, hairy human hands, a human head, bat wings and a poisoned tail-tip.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,
His head and upper part expos'd on land,
But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
His face the semblance of a just man's wore,
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,
And either side, were painted o'er with nodes
And orbits.  Colours variegated more
Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state
With interchangeable embroidery wove,
Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.
As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,
Stands part in water, part upon the land;
Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,
The beaver settles watching for his prey;
So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,
Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void
Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,
With sting like scorpion's arm'd.  Then thus my guide:
"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,
Far as to that ill beast, who couches there."

The '''sandestin''', {{monsym|sandestin}}, is the rarest of the [[shapeshifter|shapeshifting]] [[monster]]s in ''[[NetHack]]'', and is only generated in [[Gehennom]]. Although it is represented by the glyph of a major demon, it is not [[demon]]ic. Sandestins have a {{frac|1|6}} chance of changing form per turn, and will mimic [[summon nasties#Nasties|monsters that may be created by summon nasties]] {{frac|6|7}} of the time, or random monsters the rest of the time.

It is quite possible to play ''NetHack'' for a long time without knowing the existence of these monsters, as they always mimic other monsters and leave no corpse. They will often be [[peaceful]] to chaotic players, which is an easy way to tell them from the monsters they mimic, most of which are always generated hostile, and [[chameleon]]s, which are neutral. As well of course, donning a [[ring of protection from shape changers]] will show them for what they are.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds of contention came from the direction of the work-room. Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue bird-like creature, some six feet in height.
Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep in his fulgurite and Sarsem perched in the rafters."
        [...]
"No matter," said Rhialto.  "He has brought Sarsem, and this was his requirement.  In the main, Osherl, you have done well!"
"And my indenture point?"
"Much depends upon Sarsem's testimony.  Sarsem, will you sit?"
"In this guise, I find it more convenient to stand."
"Then why not alter to human form and join us in comfort at the table?"
"That is a good idea."  Sarsem became a naked young epicene in an integument of lavender scales with puffs of purple hair like pom-poms growing down his back.  He seated himself at the table but declined refreshment.  "This human semblance, though typical, is after all, only a guise.  If I were to put such things inside myself, I might well become uneasy."

&&%s&& %s Shapeshifter {147944 2022-08-24T10:07:30Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} links, intro In ''[[NetHack]]'', various monsters are '''shapeshifters''' or '''shape changers''' that can change form either randomly or at will. The various types of shapeshifters include:
* {{monsymlink|chameleon}}
* {{monsymlink|doppelganger}}
* {{monsymlink|sandestin}}

All are capable of imitating other monsters - which monsters they imitate is dependent on which monster is in question - and will shift between disguises on a frequent basis. Wearing a [[ring of protection from shape changers]] will force them into their normal form. Forcing one to polymorph (by wand, spell, or potion) will not change their base form - they'll polymorph immediately, but continue to shapeshift.  Forcing one to polymorph ''while it is mode-locked by protection from shape changers'' can change its base form permanently.  They are created with starting inventory appropriate for their polymorphed form. Examining a shapeshifter with a [[stethoscope]] will identify it as such.

Chameleons, doppelgangers and sandestins have a 1/6 chance every turn to change shape - even when they are [[sleep|sleeping]] (e.g. in a [[zoo]]). Chameleons choose an animal form 2/3 times, doppelgangers choose a "[[Summon_nasties#Nasties|nasty]]"<ref>{{function|wizard.c|nasties}}</ref> form 1/7 times, or if that fails, then choose a player class (2/3 chance). Sandestins pick a "nasty" form 6/7 times.<ref>{{function|mon.c|select_newcham_form}}</ref>

[[werecreature|Lycanthropes]] are also a type of shape changer, alternating between human and animal. They are:

* {{monsym|wererat (human)}}, [[wererat]]s
* {{monsym|werejackal (human)}}, [[werejackal]]s
* {{monsym|werewolf (human)}}, [[werewolf|werewolves]]

Since [[NetHack 3.6.0]], [[Vampire (monster class)|vampires]] can change into several different forms. Unless you wear a ring of protection from shape changers, they will often be seen in [[vampire bat]] form, but can also turn into [[Fog cloud|fog clouds]] to bypass doors. Vampire lords can also turn into [[Wolf|wolves]]. Killing them in any alternate form will cause them to rise in their base vampire form. In 3.6.0 only, due to a bug, [[Genocide|genociding]] vampires would make shapeshifted vampires unkillable.

* {{monsymlink|vampire}}
* {{monsymlink|vampire lord}}
* {{monsymlink|Vlad the Impaler}}

Finally, we have the [[mimic]]s. They do not attempt to change into other creatures, but they instead pretend to be objects, doors, or stairs, and most often reside in shops. As far as actually fooling players goes, these are by far the most effective. There are three variations:
* {{monsymlink|small mimic}}
* {{monsymlink|large mimic}}
* {{monsymlink|giant mimic}}

{{for|the player race in SLASH'EM|Doppelganger (starting race)}}

The '''doppelganger''' is a type of [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is a [[Human (monster attribute)|human]] [[shapeshifter]] that possesses [[sleep resistance]] in its default form, in addition to any resistances conferred by its current form. In its normal form, it has a single weapon attack.

Each turn, doppelgangers have a {{frac|6}} chance to change form - when they change form, they have a {{frac|4|7}} chance of becoming a random [[player monster]] with the appropriate rank title for that [[role]] based on its [[monster level]] (e.g. a doppelganger imitating a fourth-tier [[Healer]] appears as a "dresser", while one imitating an equivalent [[Wizard]] appears as a "magician"). Otherwise, they have a {{frac|7}} chance of becoming a monster that can be summoned via the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]], a {{frac|2|21}} chance of becoming a random [[quest guardian]] (guardians corresponding to the player's [[role]] are exempt), and a {{frac|4|21}} chance of becoming a random monster (heavily weighted towards [[humanoid]]s).{{refsrc|src/mon.c|3490|nethack=3.6.6}}

Eating a doppelganger [[corpse]] or [[tin]] will cause you to [[polymorph]], and is considered [[cannibalism]] for [[Human (starting race)|human]] characters.

==Generation==
Doppelgangers will usually begin appearing midway through the dungeon, and are always hostile.

In addition to random generation, if the corpse of a unique monster would be left in a [[bones]] file, it is replaced with the corpse of a doppleganger, and a statue of a unique monster found in bones will turn into a doppleganger in the guise of that monster if revived via stone to flesh.{{refsrc|src/bones.c|152|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/trap.c|587|nethack=3.6.6}} Trying to wish for a statue of a unique monster and reanimating it will also produce a doppelganger disguised as that monster.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|608|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Doppelgangers are the source of a majority of player monsters that you will encounter in the main dungeon and other branches. Unfortunately, like [[chameleons]] they are also responsible for out-of-depth encounters with summonable "nasties" - this makes finding one in the [[Sokoban]] zoo a potential unwelcome surprise. Unlike chameleons, dopplegangers are more likely to take the form of such monsters and also cannot be tamed.

As with other shapechangers, deal with doppelgangers cautiously and quickly - the [[ring of protection from shape changers]] or some form of [[cancellation]] will force them into base form, which is only slightly more damaging than a chameleon and much less lethal than most of the nasties it can imitate. Thankfully, a doppelganger will more often elect for the form of a player monster, which they can still deal decent damage with if they picks up any suitable weapons while making its way to you.

As they are considered human, those playing human characters should be careful not to sacrifice them unless they are chaotic, and should not eat their corpse or meat unless they are a human [[Caveman]] that intends to polymorph. Additionally, be wary of leaving their corpses near carnivorous [[pet]]s, especially rare ones such as [[purple worm]]s.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Pets will no longer eat corpses that would cause them to polymorph unless they are starving or on the verge of untaming.}}

==History==
Doppelgangers first appear in [[NetHack 3.3.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Doppelgänger}}
"Doppelgänger" (sometimes spelled "doppleganger") is a German word that literally means "double-walker", and refers to a biologically unrelated look-alike or double of a living person. The concept of alter egos and double spirits has appeared in the folklore and traditions of many cultures throughout human history: doppelgängers in fiction are often portrayed as ghostly or paranormal phenomena, and are usually seen as harbingers of bad luck; some other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an evil twin. A closely related concept is the [[wikipedia:Changeling|changeling]], a look-alike fairy that is usually left in place of a human child stolen by other fairies.

The doppelgangers of ''NetHack'' originate from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where they appear as early as the 1st Edition. Doppelgangers are usually solitary and appear as tall, elven and androgynous gray-skinned humanoids in their base forms; they have bulbous heads with formless faces and bulging yellow eyes that lack pupils. Despite this weak appearance, doppelgangers possess exceptional strength and agility &mdash; their mutable form can take on the likeness of any humanoid between 4 and 8 feet tall, including their clothing and equipment, though without replicating the abilities of those items. However, doppelgangers could not duplicate the mental traits of whoever they replaced, such as personality or mannerisms, unless they kept their victim alive and close by.

In combat, doppelgangers prefer the element of surprise to close in on foes and slam them around with their brute strength; a doppelganger most commonly targets humanoids that they plan to kill and replace. They also possess a continuous spell-like ability similar to ESP that lets them detect the thoughts of their foes, and gives them resistance to sleep and charm-based spells. Dopplegangers would frequently use this ability to learn everything they could about their chosen target after replacing them.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
{{main|Doppelganger (starting race)}}
In [[SLASH'EM]], doppelgangers are a playable race, with high stats, natural [[protection]], and the ability to polymorph at will via the "#youpoly" [[extended command]] (which costs 20 [[power]]). Both player and non-player doppelgangers also benefit from polymorph changes in SLASH'EM, where killing a polymorphed monster reverts them to their base form instead.

===NetHack brass===
In [[NetHack brass]], doppelgangers instead always imitate the player, copying your inventory and attributes; the items a doppelganger duplicates usually disappears upon their death as soon as they hit the ground. Items stolen from a doppelganger (e.g. via #bereave) will remain in your inventory, but will disappear if they leave the inventory in any way - this technically makes it possible for "duplicate" artifacts to exist, though they will revert to their base item once stolen from the doppelganger, and also disappear once they leave your inventory.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], doppelgangers are classified as [[Fey (dNetHack)|fey creatures]]. They may appear among the court of an [[elven monarch]]-ruled [[Throne room#dNetHack|throne room]].

Dopplegangers are one of the many quest monsters encountered on the [[Anachrononaut quest]]: {{frac|7}} of the randomly generated monsters are aberrations, and of those aberrations {{frac|5}} will be doppelgangers.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], killing a shapeshifter such as a doppelganger reverts them to their base form as in SLASH'EM, but a doppelganger "killed" this way revives as [[cancelled]] and cannot shapeshift again.

==Encyclopedia entry==

The patch is against [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2]], a version which already contains parts of the Lethe patch. The name SLethe can also refer specifically the 0.0.7E7F2 [[playground]] at [[slashem.crash-override.net]] that uses this patch, or the playground at [[em.slashem.me]] that also uses this patch, or to the [[Rodney (bot)|cloned Rodney bot]] that reports deaths from this playground to IRC #slashem at [[Freenode]] prior to operation moving to another network.

SLethe adds several new levels, the [[Lethe]] river and three new objects; the patch drastically replaces the old Gehennom of mazes and lairs with a new, mostly fixed-layout hazard. However, the patch does not add new monsters, because SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2 already contains the Lethe monsters, even [[Cthulhu]].

Michael Clarke created the original Lethe patch for [[NetHack 3.3.1]]. In 2002, the SLASH'EM project began to merge the Lethe patch into SLASH'EM. Darshan Shaligram did much of the initial porting work. A question arose about how to integrate the new Lethe levels into SLASH'EM. (Threads from the slashem-devel mailing list are [https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=342F6DED4DF4D511AA5A00B0D079FEE3010FE131%40MAYA Some questions on Lethe] and [https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=65ts1lqa.fsf%40aztec.soft.net Dungeon reorganization - shades of Lethe].) As a result, the release of SLASH'EM 0.0.7 contains the new monsters from the Lethe patch, but not the new levels. (Forum thread is [https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1153654&forum_id=30376 Lethe].)

Then Marcin Kościelnicki ported the remainder of the Lethe patch to SLASH'EM. This patch is SLethe 1.1. ([[Rgrn]] thread is [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/fc91f67121fa70b4 Slashem & lethe].) This patch is a context diff, against SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7. Fetch the patch from http://markosc.w.interia.pl/Slethe-1.1.patch. Note that a [[context diff]] is more difficult to read than a [[unified diff]].

The playground running at slashem.crash-override.net and em.slashem.me is SLethe 1.5. This is a context diff against SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2. There is a copy of SLethe 1.5 at http://bhaak.net/nethack/Slethe-1.5.patch. This patch is difficult to apply because extra copies of objnam.c.orig and zap.c.orig are in the patch; these conflict with the backups that the patch command makes when you apply the patch.

== Changes made by this patch ==
''Warning! The content of this section is a result of reading the patch, and does not represent actual experience playing in these levels.''

* Starting below [[Medusa's Island]], some levels now contain ''lethe'' water that causes amnesia. Do not step or swim in this water.
* The [[Lethe Gorge]] is the dungeon branch immediately below Medusa. It contains the nine levels, all of fixed layout, with the Castle on the third level and the stair to the [[Valley of the Dead]] ([[Gehennom]]) on the ninth level. Some levels specialise in certain monsters, like [[ogre]]s or [[undead]].
* The [[Castle]] is now in the Lethe, so the [[moat]] contains Lethe water.
** The Castle also has extra towers on the side, so even if you cross above the water, you will not be able to go around to the back of the Castle. You can use the secret doors to enter the side of the castle.
** A second [[staircase]] down from the Castle leads to a wine cellar with many [[jelly|jellies]], [[pudding]]s, and [[green slime]]s.
* Gehennom is [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)|rearranged]]. Now 0.0.7E7F2 had the valley first, then [[demon]]s, [[Wizard's Tower]], and [[devil]]s. The valley stays first, but the patch rearranges the lairs, mixing the demons and devils, putting easy [[Asmodeus]] before difficult [[Demogorgon]].
** The Lethe reappears in the [[Valley of the Dead]] and again in all of the demon and devil lairs. Many lairs now fill the level, removing the random [[maze]] that once surrounded them.
** Gehennom also contains a [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)#The Pleasant Valley|Pleasant Valley]]; it includes several peaceful [[monster]]s but also a group of hostile opponents, though many of them are asleep. It also contains the entrance to [[Vlad's Tower]].
** Above the sanctum are the levels of the [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)#The Gulf of N'Kai|Gulf of N'kai]]. Players should be ready to dig through walls and fight some of the new [[monster]]s. One level has a portal that leads outside Gehennom to the [[Wizard's Tower]].
* [[Gehennom (Lethe Patch)#Cthulhu's Sanctum|Cthulhu's Sanctum]]! The sanctum is now a dangerous place with ''two'' [[drawbridge]]s, ''eight'' unaligned temples, and plenty of squeaky boards to wake the [[deeper one]]s and [[deepest one]]s. [[Cthulhu]] himself stands in one of the temples with the [[Amulet of Yendor]]. If you kill him, then he reappears on the level.
* New weapon: [[silver capped staff]] belonging to [[quarterstaff]] group.
* New scrolls: [[scroll of demonology]] and [[scroll of elementalism]], which you or a monster can use to summon [[&]] or [[E]]. If used carefully, then you might summon tame ones.
* New monsters.
** If a [[parrot]] dies in a shop, then it triggers a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python Monty Python] joke and the [[shopkeeper]] revives it. This also happens to you if you polymorphed into a parrot, had [[unchanging]], and the shopkeeper is non-hostile.

:''"Sergeant" redirects here. For other uses of the term, see [[Sergeant (disambiguation)]].''

The '''Yendorian army''' is a group of [[Human (monster attribute)|human]]s encountered in ''[[NetHack]]''. According to their [[encyclopedia]] entry, they are employed and often trained directly by the [[Wizard of Yendor]] himself. The Yendorian army is composed of:
* {{monsym|soldier}} '''soldiers'''
* {{monsym|sergeant}} '''sergeants'''
* {{monsym|lieutenant}} '''lieutenants'''
* {{monsym|captain}} '''captains'''

All Yendorian Army members are [[chaotic]], are not valid [[polymorph]] forms, and can [[follow]] the player to other levels; like other humans, they do not respect [[Elbereth]]. They have low [[monster magic resistance]], and possess at least one weapon attack per turn; lieutenants and captains are capable of two per turn.

==Generation==
{{main|Mercenary}}
All members of the army are considered [[mercenaries]], which among other things governs how their [[Monster starting inventory|starting inventory]] is generated. All soldiers are eligible for [[offensive item]]s. 

Yendorian army soldiers and sergeants are frequently generated in small [[group]]s. [[Barracks]] are [[special room]]s populated entirely by mercenaries; very large contingents of soldiers and barracks are guaranteed to appear in the [[castle]] and [[Fort Ludios]].

===Weapons===
Ordinary soldiers have a {{frac|3}} chance of being generated with a random weapon from the set of all [[polearm]]s, plus [[lance]]s and [[mattock]]s; if this is the case, they will always get either a knife or a [[dagger]] as a secondary weapon, with equal probability.{{refsrc|makemon.c|190}} Otherwise, a plain soldier's primary weapon will have be either an ordinary [[spear]] or an ordinary [[short sword]] with equal probability; these soldiers have a {{frac|3|4}} chance of taking a knife as a secondary weapon.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Lances and mattocks no longer generate as starting weapons on watchmen and soldiers.<ref>[https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/da859c5eb88e17d04ec2bb37e2c12842e9f4c4a9 fix github issue #623 - soldiers and mattocks]</ref>}}

Higher-ranked soldiers randomly take one of two primary weapons, with equal probability. Sergeants choose either a [[flail]] or a [[mace]]; lieutenants choose either an ordinary [[broadsword]] or a [[long sword]]; and captains choose either a long sword or a [[silver saber]]. All of these higher-ranked soldiers also have a {{frac|3|4}} chance of taking a knife as a secondary weapon.

===Armor===
Each rank of soldier has a particular ''target AC'' as follows:

{| class="prettytable"
! Rank !! Target AC
|-
| soldier || 3
|-
| sergeant || 0
|-
| lieutenant || &minus;2
|-
| captain || &minus;3
|}

The game uses a complicated procedure to outfit each mercenary with a selection of armor giving roughly the target AC. If the soldier is unlucky, they might be given less armor; if they are lucky, they might be given enchanted armor that takes them beyond the target. Each mercenary is generated with one suit of body armor, and will always receive [[leather armor]] at bare minimum. All ranks are eligible for [[ring mail]] or [[studded leather armor]]; sergeants and above are eligible for [[splint mail]] or [[banded mail]]; and lieutenants and captains are eligible for [[plate mail]] or [[crystal plate mail]].

In addition, soldiers  of all ranks may be randomly generated with any of the items from the following list:

<div class="div-col columns column-width" style="-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em;">
*[[helmet]]
*[[dented pot]]
*[[small shield]]
*[[large shield]]
*[[low boots]]
*[[high boots]]
*[[leather gloves]]
*[[leather cloak]]
</div>

There is no guarantee that any particular non-body armor slot will be filled; soldiers can be given multiple items for any slot.

===Other items===
Soldiers of all ranks have a {{frac|3}} chance of being generated with a [[K-ration]], and an independent {{frac|2}} chance of being generated with a [[C-ration]]. Sergeants and above also have a {{frac|3}} chance of being generated with a [[bugle]].{{refsrc|makemon.c|549}} Ordinary soldiers are only {{frac|13}}th as likely as other monsters to receive a [[defensive item]], [[miscellaneous item]], or [[gold]];{{refsrc|makemon.c|653}} other ranks are unaffected.

==Strategy==
The usual tactics for handling groups of monsters applies; drawing soldiers into a corridor is effective for both reducing vulnerability and thinning their ranks, especially since they will likely be caught in the path of their allies' attack wands. However, said wands also make them potentially dangerous to face without [[reflection]] or [[magic resistance]] in later levels, especially Fort Ludios; on the other hand, a strong enough player can also use them as a source of such wands if so desired. As a majority of soldiers normally wear gloves, they can wield [[footrice]] corpses against you; be wary of this if you kill one in their presence, especially in [[Gehennom]].

Due to the potential frequency of barracks outside of the guaranteed set in the Castle, soldiers may become [[extinct]] in a game where you reach Fort Ludios.

In addition to wands, the armor, weapons and items dropped from killing Yendorian army fighters are a good source of [[polyfodder]] and can also replace your own eroded or lower-enchantment armor. In addition, their corpses will keep you carnivorous pet full, and are plentiful food sources; you can stash the C-rations and K-rations for later use, since they take only one turn to eat. Additionally, non-humans and human [[Cavemen]] can get half a [[food ration]]'s worth of nutrition from eating their corpses without worrying about [[cannibalism]].

===Bribery===
Yendorian Army soldiers, as well as any monster with the <code>M2_MERC</code> flag in their code, can be [[bribe]]d by throwing a certain amount of gold at them, turning them [[peaceful]]. Bribing a soldier can be used to block off a hallway in areas such as the Castle; hostile monsters will not route their movement past peaceful ones.{{refsrc|dokick.c|319}} This can then be used to herd and eliminate groups of monsters with other crowd control strategies&mdash;a knight can [[pound]] away at foes with a [[lance]] without disturbing the peaceful merc between them, and [[wizard]]s can cast skilled {{spell of|fireball}} or {{spell of|cone of cold}} with impunity. This will not stop [[teleport]]ing or covetous foes, and the soldier can still die from enemy ranged attacks - a human shield won't do much good against a [[black dragon]]'s [[disintegration]] breath.

==Variant==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], soldiers always wield [[firearm]]s of some kind.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The soldiers of Yendor are well-trained in the art of war,
many trained by the [[Wizard of Yendor|Wizard]] himself.  Some say the soldiers
are explorers who were unfortunate enough to be captured,
and put under the Wizard's spell.  Those who have survived
encounters with soldiers say they travel together in platoons,
and are fierce fighters.  Because of the load of their combat
gear, however, one can usually run away from them, and doing
so is considered a wise thing.

'''NetHack 3.2.1''' is the 21st public release of [[NetHack]] and the 17th by the [[DevTeam]].  [[Mike Stephenson]] announced it to the [[Usenet]] newsgroups rec.games.roguelike.announce and [[rec.games.roguelike.nethack]] in June 1996.<ref>Mike Stephenson, [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/c45e5dfbb73c15c8/39a4a78dfd4df082 NetHack 3.2.1 Release].  rec.games.roguelike.nethack and rec.games.roguelike.announce, June 16, 1996.</ref>

== Availability ==

NetHack 3.2.1 has no fully authoritative source.  The [[DevTeam]] ceased to distribute NetHack by [[Usenet]] after [[NetHack 3.1.3]].  It was made available at UUNet, but no longer exists there; the main distribution site was by [[wikipedia:FTP|FTP]] at linc.cis.upenn.edu, but that site no longer accepts anonymous logins.

A complete tarball is available from the Free Software Foundation at [ftp://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/nethack/nethack-3.2.1.tar.gz].

== Significant changes ==

NetHack 3.2.1 is principally a bug-fix release.

Notable changes in NetHack 3.2.1 include:
* Weapon skill processing is now handled by #[[enhance]]; missiles and tridents are now accounted for in the weapon skill table.
* The options menu is significantly revised.
* Pressing a key corresponding to the default character of an object class now shows your objects of that class.
* Many smaller bug fixes.

== The adventurer ==

The player may choose from these roles:

{| class="prettytable"
|-
!Role!!Alignment
|-
|[[Archeologist]]||Lawful
|-
|[[Barbarian]]||Neutral
|-
|[[Caveman|Cave(wo)man]]||Lawful
|-
|[[Elf]]||Chaotic
|-
|[[Healer]]||Neutral
|-
|[[Knight]]||Lawful
|-
|[[Priest|Priest(ess)]]||Random
|-
|[[Rogue]]||Chaotic
|-
|[[Samurai]]||Lawful
|-
|[[Tourist]]||Neutral
|-
|[[Valkyrie]]||Neutral
|-
|[[Wizard]]||Neutral
|}

All classes permit male and female adventurers, except the Valkyrie which must be female.

The adventurer has [[experience]], [[hit points]], [[magical energy]], [[armor class]], [[alignment]], and the six major [[attribute]]s.  He may advance to [[experience level]] 30.

The initial [[pet]] is a little [[dog]] for Cavemen and Samurai, a [[kitten]] for Wizards, and a random choice of the two (or the user's choice in his [[options]]) for all others.

== Dungeon features ==

The main trunk of the dungeon begins at level 1, where the game begins, and proceeds down [[stairs]] to [[Medusa's Lair]] and the [[Castle]].  From there, it is necessary to enter a [[trap door]] to the [[Valley of the Dead]].  Further stairs down eventually lead to the invocation level.  Performing the [[invocation ritual]] at the [[vibrating square]] opens the stairs to the [[Sanctum]].

With the [[Amulet of Yendor]] in hand, the adventurer may ascend from level 1 into the [[Plane of Earth]]; thence s/he may proceed through [[magic portal]]s to the planes of [[Plane of Air|Air]], [[Plain of Fire|Fire]], and [[Plain of Water|Water]], and thence to the [[Astral Plane]].  Offering the [[Amulet of Yendor]] on the correct [[high altar]] wins the game.

Along the way, one will encounter these branches and special levels:

* A second [[stair]] to the [[Gnomish Mines]].  Therein, one will find [[Mine Town]] and, at the end, the bottom level with a [[luckstone]].

* The [[Oracle]] level.

* A possible [[Bigroom]].

* The [[Rogue level]].

* The [[magic portal]] to the [[Quest]].

* A possible [[magic portal]], inside a [[vault]], to [[Fort Ludios]].

* [[Medusa's Lair]].

* The [[Castle]].

* The [[Valley of the Dead]].  [[Gehennom]] begins here, and it is no longer safe to [[pray]].

* The lairs of [[Asmodeus]], [[Juiblex]], [[Baalzebub]], and [[Orcus]].

* A second upward [[stairs|staircase]] to [[Vlad's Tower]].

* The [[Wizard's Tower]]; it is visible but not accessible from here.

* A [[Fake Tower]] containing a random [[Amulet]].

* A [[Fake Tower]] containing a [[magic portal]] by which the Wizard's Tower may be entered.

To win the game, it is necessary to complete these tasks:

* Gather seven candles, possibly in [[Izchak]]'s [[lighting shop]] in [[Mine Town]].

* Complete the [[Quest]] and get the [[Bell of Opening]].

* Kill [[Vlad the Impaler]] and get the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]].

* Kill the [[Wizard of Yendor]] and get the [[Book of the Dead]].

* Proceed to the [[vibrating square]] and perform the [[invocation ritual]].

* Kill the [[high priest]] of [[Moloch]] and get the [[Amulet of Yendor]].

* Escape from the dungeon.

* Pass through the [[Elemental Planes]].

* Arrive at the correct [[altar]] in the [[Astral Plane]].

* Offer the [[Amulet of Yendor]] to the god of your [[alignment]].

[[Special room]]s are:

* [[throne room]]
* [[swamp]]
* [[vault]]
* [[beehive]]
* [[crypt]]
* [[barracks]]
* [[treasure zoo]]
* [[Oracle]]
* [[temple]]
* [[shop]]

Special [[dungeon feature]]s are:
* [[pool]]
* [[moat]]
* [[water]]
* [[drawbridge]]
* [[lava]]
* [[door]]
* [[ladder]]
* [[fountain]]
* [[throne]]
* [[sink]]
* [[altar]]
* [[ice]]
* [[air]]
* [[cloud]]

Traps are:

* [[arrow trap]]
* [[dart trap]]
* [[falling rock trap]]
* [[squeaky board]]
* [[bear trap]]
* [[land mine]]
* [[rolling boulder trap]]
* [[sleeping gas trap]]
* [[rust trap]]
* [[fire trap]]
* [[pit]]
* [[spiked pit]]
* [[hole]]
* [[trapdoor]]
* [[teleportation trap]]
* [[level teleporter]]
* [[magic portal]]
* [[web]]
* monsters disguised as [[statue]]s
* [[magic trap]]
* [[anti-magic field]]
* [[polymorph trap]]

A [[wand of wishing]] is guaranteed in the [[Castle]], in its modern position, protected by [[Elbereth]] and a [[chest]].
