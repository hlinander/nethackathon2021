낙석 함정이 위험하다는 뜻

If your pet does get trapped, try #untrapping it.
만약 애완동물이 함정에 걸리면 #untrapping 으로 함정을 해제해줄 수 있습니다.

Be warned that unsuccessfully attempting to remove a bear trap will injure your pet, and if done repeatedly may kill it.
곰 덫을 해제하는 데 실패할 경우 애완동물을 다치게 할 수 있고, 계속 실패하면 애완동물을 죽일 수도 있습니다.

Attempting to rescue a pet from a pit when there is no adjacent non-pit square (other than the one you are standing on) may have the same effect.
구덩이에 빠진 애완동물을 구출할 때, 주위에 구덩이가 아닌 땅이 없을 경우에도 같은 결과가 발생합니다.

Some pets are vulnerable to polymorph traps and level teleporters.
Moreover, holes and trap doors can inconveniently separate you from your pet. Thus, it is useful to detect and disarm traps as quickly as possible.
몇 몇 애완동물은 폴리모프 함정과 레벨 텔레포트 함정에 취약합니다.
또한 구멍과 트랩 도어는 플레이어와 애완동물을 떨어트릴 수 있습니다. 그러므로 최대한 빠르게 함정을 감지하고 해제하는 것이 중요합니다.

Avoid displacing your pet into water or traps.
물이나 함정에 있을 때 애완동물과 자리를 바꾸지 마십시오.

If you have lots of pets or are in a tight space, they may have no other place to go, and pets will easily drown.
만약 애완동물이 많거나 공간이 좁을 경우에는, 애완동물이 탈출 할 장소가 없어 쉽게 익사할 수 있습니다.

Like you, pets level up by defeating monsters.
애완동물도 플레이어처럼 몬스터를 죽여서 레벨업 합니다.

However, while your character gains experience points that build towards new experience level, the pets gain a random number of hit points between one and one more than the defeated monster's level, and their level is increased to keep it adequate to the hit points they have.
하지만 플레이어는 레벨업을 하기 위해서 경험치를 얻지만, 애완동물은 1d( 죽인 몬스터의 레벨 ) 만큼의 HP를 얻습니다.
아래는 몰겠음 ㅋㅋ

That means they can level up faster than the player.
즉, 애완동물은 플레이어보다 빠르게 레벨업 할 수 있습니다.

Thus, it may be helpful to allow your pet to finish off weak monsters like grid bugs or newts to quickly gain levels early on, so that it can become strong enough to survive the traps and encounters in the lower dungeon levels.

따라서, 애완동물이 그리드 버그나 뉴트와 같은 약한 몬스터를 처치해서 레벨을 빠르게 올림으로서, 던전 초반의 함정에서 살아남을 수 있도록 강하게 만드는 것이 좋습니다.

See [[Growing up]] for more details about pet advancement.
애완동물의 발달에 따른 자세한 내용은 Growing Up 항목에서 볼 수 있습니다.

Pets cannot escape engulfing attacks, so use telepathy to find and eliminate purple worms, trappers, and lurkers above often.
애완동물은 삼키기 공격을 탈출 할 수 없으므로 (= purple worm, lurker above, trapper 한테 맞으면 한 방에 죽음)
텔레파시를 이용하여 purple wrom, trapper, lurker above를 죽여야 합니다.

If your pet is killed, a wand or spell of undead turning can be used to resurrect it, but only if the manner of its demise leaves a corpse.
애완동물이 죽었을 경우, undead turning 마법이나 완드를 사용하여 애완동물을 부활시킬 수 있지만, 시체가 남아있어야 합니다.

However, it's not guaranteed that the pet will be resurrected tame—
if, while your pet was alive, you abused it or were the one who actually killed it (even if accidentally), it will always be resurrected hostile.
하지만 애완동물이 반드시 길들여진 상태로 부활하지는 않습니다.
애완동물이 살아있었을 때 애완동물을 학대했거나 애완동물을 죽였을 경우 ( 실수로 죽였을지라도 ) 에는, 애완동물이 항상 적대적으로 부활합니다.

Even if you didn't abuse or kill it, there's still a chance, though smaller, that it will come back hostile.
애완동물을 학대하거나 죽이지 않을 경우에도 낮은 확률로 애완동물이 적대적으로 부활할 수 있습니다.

So you should have the means to (re)tame your pet ready in case you decide to resurrect it.
따라서 애완동물을 부활시키려는 경우에는 애완동물을 다시 길들일 수 있도록 준비를 하는 것이 좋습니다.

=== 애완동물이 공격하지 않는 것들 ===
They say discretion is the better part of valor.
용기보다 중요한 것은 신중함이라는 말이 있습니다.

Pets don't always possess such discretion, and often find themselves overpowered by opponents they take on.
애완동물이 항상 그런 신중함을 가지는 것은 아니며, 때로는 상대방이 애완동물을 압도하기도 합니다. ( 번역 불확실 )

Although a pet will not attack a monster whose passive attack could kill it in one round, this calculation takes no account of the monster's weapon or likely counter-attacks.

애완동물이 상대의 패시브 공격을 맞고 죽지 않더라도, 이 계산은 몬스터의 반격이나 무기를 고려하지 않은 상태의 예상입니다.

Be especially careful about bringing dogs or cats into the Gnomish Mines, or horses into shops, especially in the deeper levels.
개나 고양이를 노움광산에 데려오거나 말을 상점에 데려오는 것을 특히 주의해야 합니다.

Horses seem especially vulnerable to mimics, and have also been known to attack shopkeepers, as they reach a higher level than dogs or cats.
말은 특히 미믹에게 취약하고 ( 왜 그런진 몰겠음; ) 개나 고양이보다 레벨이 높게 올라가기 때문에 레벨이 높을 때는 상점 주인을 공격하기도 합니다.

A pet will not attack:
다음과 같은 상황에서는 애완동물이 공격하지 않습니다:

a monster which is two or more levels higher than itself
(A fully grown large cat or dog is level 9, a fully grown warhorse is level 10, and a shopkeeper is level 11, so a warhorse may attack a shopkeeper but a large cat or large dog will not.)
자신보다 2레벨 이상인 몬스터
( 큰 개와 큰 고양이 만렙 9, 전투마 만렙 10, 상점 주인 레벨 11, 그래서 만렙 전투마는 상점주인을 공격하고 개랑 고양이는 안 함 )

a floating eye 90% of the time, provided the pet can see.
( 애완동물이 볼 수 있는 상태일 때 ) floating eye 는 90% 확률로 공격 안 함.

a gelatinous cube 90% of the time.
gelatinous cube는 90% 확률로 공격 안 함.

a monster whose maximum passive damage exceeds the pet's current hit points.
패시브 반격 (jelly 몬스터들)의 최대 피해량이 애완동물의 현재 체력보다 클 때

a peaceful monster if the pet is below 25% of its maximum HP.
애완동물의 체력이 25% 이하일 때, peaceful 몬스터

a peaceful quest leader or quest guardian.
peaceful 상태의 퀘스트 리더나 퀘스트 가디언들

a stoning monster, if the pet is not stoning-resistant.
석화저항이 없을 때, 만지면 돌 되는 몬스터

[[Conflict]] overrides all of these restrictions, and will cause a pet to attack any nearby monster, provided it doesn't resist.
분쟁(Conflict) 효과는 이러한 모든 제약을 무시하고, 저항하지 못할 경우 애완동물이 주위에 있는 아무 몬스터나 공격합니다.

=== 사망 메시지 ===

There are a number of subtly different messages associated with the death of a pet.
애완동물이 죽었을 때 나오는 많은 메세지들이 있습니다.

{{message|You hear the rumble of distant thunder...|You killed it yourself. Penalty −15 alignment and −1 Luck.}}

There is no special penalty for abandoning or losing track of pets, eating your pets' corpses (normal penalty from corpses of the pets' species still apply, such as cannibalism for cat and dog corpses), or (surprisingly) for genociding your pet's species or class.
애완동물을 버리거나, 애완동물의 시체를 먹거나 ( 개나 고양이 시체에 원래 있는 식인 패널티는 받음 ), 애완동물의 종류를 학살(genocide) 하여도
플레이어에게 패널티는 없습니다.

==속도==

Your pets follow you along stairways and portals if they are adjacent to you when you climb, descend, or enter (except when they're busy eating or can't move).
플레이어가 계단을 올라가거나 내려갈 때, 포탈을 이용할 때 애완동물이 플레이어와 인접해있으면 애완동물과 함께 이동합니다.
( 애완동물이 밥먹거나 움직일 수 없을 때를 제외 )

Life can be frustrating if you are considerably faster than your pet.
플레이어가 애완동물보다 빠를 경우 인생이 지루해질 수 있습니다. (?? ㅋㅋ)

A wand of speed monster can be helpful, as can a whistle, especially a magic whistle.
speed monster 완드나 마법 호루라기가 크게 도움이 될 수 있습니다.

However, speed beyond normal player speed does not increase your pet's damage output (except if confused or conflicted).
하지만 플레이어의 속도를 초과하는 속도는 애완동물의 공격력을 증가시키지는 않습니다. ( 혼란에 걸렸거나 conflict 상태 제외 ) 몬 말인지 몰겠음 ㅋㅋ;;

Removal of items which may be cursed from corridors can't hurt, unless one of the items is a loadstone. In that case (or if a corridor is blocked by a trap), try digging a path around the item or trap in question.
몰겠음 ㅋㅋ;; 일자 통로에서 길 막혔으면 옆으로 갈 수있도록 샛길 파라는 말인듯??

If you try to walk on a pet's square, you have 6⁄7 chance of swapping places with it unless it's a long worm or you are in a shop or punished.
애완동물과 자리를 바꾸려 하면 6/7 확률로 자리를 바꿀 수 있습니다.
( 플레이어가 상점에 있지 않고, 애완동물이 long worm 이 아니고, 플레이어가 puished 상태가 아닐 때 )

If the pet can't move, but you otherwise would swap places, you have a 1⁄6 chance of swapping places anyway.
애완동물이 움직일 수 없지만 자리를 바꾸려는 경우 1/6 확률로 자리를 바꿀 수 있습니다. ( 번역 부정확 )
{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|It is no longer possible to displace a pet out of a trap, directly onto a trap, into water or into other hazardous terrain. It is also no longer possible to displace a sleeping or paralysed pet, but a sessile pet can sometimes be displaced. It may be possible to displace a pet near a trap, causing it to move onto the trap.}}

==애완동물 밥주기==

For the three cardinal domestic species, appropriate foods for routine feeding are as for taming. Eggs (including rotten eggs) are appropriate for feeding carnivorous (and omnivorous) pets like dogs and cats, but they should be dropped with the '''d''' command, not [[throw]]n. (Eggs that pets will not eat are probably [[cockatrice]] and should be #named and saved.) Additionally, starving pets will eat some foods which they will not otherwise (e.g., starving horses will eat "people food" such as food rations).

Pets will never eat food that would cause them harm: pets without [[poison resistance]] won't eat poisonous corpses; pets without [[acid resistance]] won't eat acidic corpses; pets without [[petrification resistance]] won't eat [[footrice]] corpses (or eggs) or [[Medusa]]'s corpse; and no pet will eat [[green slime]] or [[Rider]] corpses.

Pets gain two to eight times more nutrition than players from food (smaller ones gain more), but take the same time to eat it.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|91}} A starving pet will "devour" the food, taking only half the normal time required to eat it, but also gaining only {{frac|3|4}} the nominal nutrition. Generally, your pets (especially the carnivorous ones) will feed themselves. Sometimes they will feed you, as they will kill monsters of types that they will not eat but that you might, or you stand a chance of beating them to the corpse. For some pet types, notably domesticated animals and intelligent monsters, it is advisable to [[chat|#chat]] with your pet frequently. Their vocalizations change noticeably when they are [[hungry]].

애완동물이 굶주린 상태일때 (500 turns after they became hungry) they become confused and their maximum hit points is divided by 3.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|223}} See "Messages", below.

Pets can be trained to more reliably drop items near you by giving them [[treat]]s after they drop something; this willingness to 'fetch' is known as [[apport]].

Every time a pet eats (no matter what they eat), their [[tameness]] goes up by 1, to a max of 20.

다른 레벨에 남겨진 애완동물들은 길들여짐을 잃지만 여전히 영양이 소모됩니다. 만약 다른 레벨의 있는 애완동물이 길들여짐이 해제되기 전에 굶어죽었더라면, 그것은 적대적이 될 것입니다. 그렇지 않으면 평화적이거나 적대적이 될 것입니다. 초식성 애완동물을 위한 충분한 음식을 찾을 수 없다면, 그것을 굶게 하지 말고 다른 레벨에 놓아두고, 나중에 음식이 가능할때 그것을 다시 길들이는게 좋습니다.

Pets left on another level from you lose tameness but still burn nutrition. If a pet on a different level would have starved before becoming untame, it will become hostile. Otherwise, it will either become peaceful or hostile. If you cannot find enough food for your herbivorous pet, leave it on another level and let it become untame rather than letting it starve, then re-tame it later when food is available.

Carnivorous and omnivorous pets will eat [[wraith]] corpses and gain one level for each, capped at [[Growing up#Magical growth|15 over base level]]. (There is no cap for gains from engulfing live wraiths.) They will also eat [[chameleon]] and [[doppelganger]] corpses, which will polymorph them.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Pets will no longer eat shapeshifter corpses unless they are starving, or they have been mistreated enough to lower their tameness to 1.}}

===메시지===
{{message|&lt;pet&gt; is confused from hunger.|Your pet is starving. It becomes confused from hunger, its maximum HP is reduced to 25%, and it has 250 more turns to live.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|235}}}}
{{message|You feel worried about your &lt;pet&gt;.|As above, but your pet is out of sight.}}

==애완동물을 위한 장비==
Monsters can use equipment like the player can, too, although there are a lot fewer things they can use.
The best way to equip a pet is to gather the items you want to give to the pet, put them in a dead end, and stand on them till your pet comes near, swap places with the pet and keep it standing over the pile till it picks up something and starts using it. If it drops something it had been using, you will need to swap places again to pick up their old stuff. For replacing equipment, the best way to do that is in a 2 long corridor with a locked door: +@A. This will take a long time as pets don't like to pick up things if you are nearby. If you just have a pile of stuff and they don't have anything that is being replaced, locking them in a closet will be faster, as pets with large values of [[apport]] are more likely to pick up things if you are far away.  This only works if the pet isn't carrying a [[key]] of its own.

===Armor and extrinsics===
{{main|Armor#Monsters, pets, and armor}}
Many humanoid monsters will pick up and wear armor. Only [[medium]]-sized monsters can wear body armor or shirts, and only medium or smaller monsters will fit into cloaks. All monsters know the enchantment of armor, and will replace one piece of armor with something that gives more AC {{refsrc|worn.c|463}}{{refsrc|hack.h|284}} than what they are currently wearing. For example, your pet Archon will replace their +0 shield of reflection with a +3 small shield in some valkyrie's bone pile.

Generally for pets, you want to give them [[magic resistance]], [[magic cancellation]], and [[reflection]]. All items that work for the player also work for monsters, provided they fit into it or actually wear amulets. Silver-haters will not use silver items. Large pets get [[MC1]] only from the [[cornuthaum]]. Feel free to load up on metal armor, it does not hinder monster spellcasting. [[Magicbane]] grants magic resistance, but monsters can swap artifact weapons, see below. Pets will not hang on to quest artifacts.

Most magical armor is not as useful for monsters as it is for players. [[Speed boots]] make monsters fast, but not very fast. An [[alchemy smock]] confers only poison resistance. [[dragon scale mail|Dragon scale mail]] and scales will grant their extrinsics to monsters. Other armor properties than those discussed do not affect monsters. After deciding what extrinsics your can give your pet with equipment, the rest of their armor should be to improve AC.

===무기===
Monsters with a weapon attack will be able to pick up and wield weapons. They will ignore the enchantment and [[BUC]] status of the weapon, and instead select which one to wield based on type. (Pets do not pick up cursed objects.) They prefer (in this order): any usable artifact weapon, cockatrice or chickatrice corpse, ''tsurugi'', runesword, ''dwarvish mattock'', ''two-handed sword'', ''battle-axe'', katana, ''unicorn horn'', crysknife, trident, long sword, elven broadsword, broadsword, scimitar, silver saber, morning star, elven short sword, dwarvish short sword, short sword, orcish short sword, mace, axe, dwarvish spear, silver spear, elven spear, spear, orcish spear, flail, bullwhip, ''quarterstaff'', javelin, aklys, club, pick-axe, rubber hose, war hammer, silver dagger, elven dagger, dagger, orcish dagger, athame, scalpel, knife, worm tooth.

이탤릭체로 된 무기는 두 손으로, 괴물이 강하고 방패를 쓰지 않으면 선택될 것입니다. 코카트리스 시체는 그 몬스터를 즉시 석화시킨다면 선택되지 않을 것입니다. Stilettos and grappling hooks will never be chosen.

If a monster has a wielded artifact weapon and picks up any other, it can switch to the new artifact and drop the old, provided the artifact is not cross-aligned and the conditions for two-handed weapons are met (if applicable). "Can" here means the first admissible artifact in the game's internal list of carried objects is chosen. If you want your pet to keep a specific artifact, give it to it while it is carrying as few objects as possible.

Pets do not use [[ranged weapon]]s, though [http://bilious.alt.org/?259 there is a patch] for this purpose.  [[3.6.1]] 버전에서, they will, however, use their [[breath weapon]] if they have any.{{refsrc|src/dogmove.c|1118|nethack=3.6.1|name=ranged_pet_attack}}

===지성이 있는 몬스터===
손이 있는 일부 몬스터는 [[unicorn horn|유니콘 뿔]]을 집어서 하나 가지고 다닐 것이며, and apply it if afflicted. Prevent the confused pet arch-lich this way!

일부 몬스터는 또한 [[key|열쇠]]를 집어서, 그리고 문을 열것입니다, perhaps to eat priests you have protected.  Be warned!

Monsters with hands can put on amulets of {{of|amulet|life saving|or=1|reflection}}. They have no preference, just whatever they wore first. If you want them to remove it, you have to get a nymph or foocubus to steal it, polyself into such a stealer, or have the monster die. Your stealing attack only reduces a pet's tameness if you do not successfully acquire an object. The monster's amulet of life saving will not be used up if it was [[nonliving]] ([[undead]], [[golem]], [[manes]], [[vortex]]).

부적을 장착하고 있던 폴리모프된 몬스터들은 여전히 부적을 장착할 것입니다.  Those who want a level 49 [[purple worm]] might consider polymorphing one from an intelligent monster, as opposed to taming one.  This may be time-consuming, but it will prevent any disintegration or death ray accidents.

지성이 있는 몬스터는 [[Potion of gain level|gain level의 물약을]] 마실 것입니다. 그들이 도달할 수 있는 최대 레벨은 49입니다 (50은 이름있는 악마 한정이지만, 그들은 길들여질수 없습니다).

==애완동물 주인을 위한 장비==
애완동물을 더 유용하게 만들거나 애완동물을 가까이 두게 할 수 있는 많은 장비들이 있습니다.
*[[Magic whistle|마법 호루라기]]는 가능한 모든 애완동물을 플레이어에게 가까이 데려올 것입니다.
*[[Stethoscope]]s will reveal information about your pet, including how injured it is, its level, and its maximum HP. [[Wand of probing|Wands of probing]] will also give you this information and any equipment the pet is wearing, but they are less efficient due to their limited number of charges.
*[[Leash|목줄]]은 당신의 애완동물을 근처에 있게 만들 것입니다.
*[[Saddle|안장]]은 일부 애완동물을 타기 위해 사용될수 있습니다. Riding boots and gloves will make applying a saddle easier.
*Carried [[treat]]s will cause pets to stay close to the player; this can be annoying if they're always underfoot.
*Spells of (extra) healing for healing pets, charm monster for acquiring new pets, stone to flesh for making treats for carnivores and omnivores.
*[[Spellbook of stone to flesh|Spell of stone to flesh]] to revive stoned pets; they may revive hostile.
*[[Wand of undead turning|Wand or spell of undead turning]] to revive killed pets; they may revive hostile.
*[[Spellbook of detect monsters|Spell of detect monster]] (or [[potion of monster detection|potions of monster detection]]) to locate pets.
*[[Wand of speed monster|몬스터 가속의 완드]], 또는 [[potion of speed|신속의 물약]]은 애완동물을 빠르게 만듭니다.
*[[Eucalyptus leaf|Eucalyptus leaves]] will act like magic whistles if blessed, and tin whistles otherwise, [[tree]]s in [[Minetown]] may give a several if kicked.
*Potions of healing, extra healing, full healing, restore ability, and gain ability will all restore a monster to full hit points if it hits them (wielded or thrown). Hitting a pet with a wielded potion counts as [[Tameness#Abuse|abuse]], however, and may later make it resurrect as hostile.
*부정수는 악마, 언데드 그리고 lycanthropes에게 2&ndash;12의 체력을 회복시켜 줍니다.
*A key to lock your pet in a room or closet, so it can heal, or equip itself, or to have it not attack something you want kept alive.  Some pets may be smart enough to pick up keys to unlock doors.
*눈가리개나 타올은 당신에게 [[telepathy|텔레파시]]가 있다면 당신의 애완동물의 위치를 알아낼수 있습니다.
*A [[bag of holding]] (or a sack) is useful to carry all the other stuff and pet food, keep treats hidden, and to [[Stealing from shops|rob shops]].
*[[Crystal ball|수정구]], including the [[Orb of Fate]] and the [[Orb of Detection]], can be used for detecting traps that could harm pets, and can be recharged indefinitely with [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]; 하지만, 수정구는 오히려 가지고 다니기에 무겁습니다.

==선호되는 애완동물==

다음은 좋은 애완동물이 되는 몬스터들의 목록입니다.  It is divided into two parts: the first consists of pets which a player might specifically work to obtain, for example through a wish or a [[polytrap]].  The second consists of pets that are useful (e.g. if you get them through a polytrap or magic trap), but not usually worth any extra effort to obtain.

===얻으려고 시도한 보람이 있는 것들===
*The [[Archon]] is by general consensus the best all-around pet, with a high maximum level, powerful physical attacks, the ability to heal and haste itself, and its blinding gaze. They can fly, don't eat, and can wield weapons and wear some armor. Archons are rare to find and difficult to tame, however, and a hostile Archon is a dangerous foe to stand near as you repeatedly try to tame it. Monsters blinded by the Archon won't respect [[Elbereth]], a possible concern for low-level characters. A "blessed [[figurine]] of an Archon" is a common first wish for [[pacifist]]s, and is popular in general.  It cannot be obtained from a polytrap, and therefore must be wished for or found.
*[[Ki-rin]] don't eat, can fly, and have superb attacks. In particular it is noteworthy as it can take a saddle as well, making it an excellent mount, especially given that its high [[Magic resistance (monster)|magic resistance]] and base level will prevent it from bucking you if you are generating [[conflict]]. They are best for a [[knight]], as it will irrevocably lose one point of [[tame]]ness each time a non-knight mounts it.  Like Archons, ki-rin are not found via polytraps.
*[[Titan]]s have excellent base level, armor class, and magic resistance, are fast, can [[Monster spell|spell-cast]], fly, wield a weapon, and wear non-body armor.  They are too large to be [[engulf]]ed, and so won't be instantly killed by digesting monsters, a common cause of death for Archons and ki-rin. They do eat, which, though sometimes an inconvenience, does mean their [[tameness]] will increase.  Thus when you fall down a [[Hole|shaft]] that herd of pet Titans won't be wild by the time you find your way back.  Titans can be obtained from a polymorph trap, and may be the strongest pet available by such means.
*[[Purple worm]]s of high enough level can swallow and thus instantly kill almost any enemy. A pet worm can be leveled up quickly by setting it loose in a [[graveyard]] containing [[wraith]]s. Their [[engulfing]] attack is not subject to corpse-leaving odds. However, that means you need to keep them away from [[chameleon]]s, [[doppelganger]]s, and [[green slime]], which will transform your pet into something less effective. Digested monsters don't leave corpses for you to eat, nor any special drops they otherwise would, such as [[unicorn horn]]s. Some powerful monsters such as Titans and dragons are too large to be engulfed.
*[[Balrog]]s have very powerful attacks, a high base level, and a good armor class. They're a valid polymorph form, making them more practical to acquire than Archons or ki-rin, and are [[inediate]], so they'll be more available for combat than purple worms or Titans. Their base speed is fairly low.

===하나 있으면 좋은 것들===
*[[Centaur]]s can use weapons and (some) armor, may be saddled and ridden, and are easy to keep fed. These are potentially excellent early pets for heroes with a {{Spell of|charm monster}} spell or a [[Scroll of taming]].
*[[Cockatrice]]s can petrify many foes. They don't have much HP, however, and their low maximum level will prevent them from attacking tougher monsters. Consider using [[conflict]] to force your pet 'trice into combat (and watch your messages to be sure you aren't [[stoning|turning to stone]]).
*[[Dragon]]s can fly, can serve as a mount, and have very good attacks. Silver and gray dragons are immune to [[death ray]]s; the former is also immune to disintegration blasts, while the latter is immune to polymorph traps. Yellow dragons are stoning-resistant. In [[3.6.0]] and older versions, they only used their [[breath weapon]]s in the presence of [[conflict]], and then only in your direction; as of [[3.6.1]], pets are allowed to use a breath or spit weapon against hostile monsters.<ref name='ranged_pet_attack' />  Pet dragons can be obtained by [[polymorphing]] yourself and laying eggs; eggs hatch into baby dragons which can [[grow up]] to full size.
*[[Winged gargoyle]]s can fly and also have decent [[AC]] and attacks; in addition, they are resistant to [[stoning]] and starvation.  Winged gargoyles are very hard to get by egg-laying; most winged gargoyle eggs hatch into regular gargoyles, and gargoyles do not grow up to winged gargoyles.
*[[Jabberwock]]s, especially [[wand of speed monster|hasted]], have excellent damage potential, and can fly and take a saddle. They lack resistances, though, and are thus vulnerable to being lost to traps, death or disintegration rays, and cockatrices.
*Arch-[[lich]]es can reach terrifyingly high levels, are always by your side even without the aid of a [[magic whistle]], can heal themselves, and have a powerful freezing touch attack. They are impotent against cold-resistant monsters, however, and frequently get in your way.  Since they will always teleport to your side, it can be very difficult to prevent them from killing [[aligned priest|priest]]s and [[shopkeeper]]s. You cannot tame master- or arch-liches directly, but you can tame a lich or demilich and let it grow up.
*A [[Mastodon]] can substitute for a [[jabberwock]] as a pet. It has the same speed, and they have higher maximum level (30), which means more HP and being aggressive against more difficult enemies. Mastodons do in 8d8 damage instead of the jabberwock's 8d10, but that's still quite a lot. They're herbivores, so you can eat most of corpses they leave behind.
*[[Mind flayer]]s do a lot of melee damage with their tentacle attacks, and can clear out monsters from a distance with their psychic blasts, which won't damage you as long as the flayer isn't hostile. A confused pet flayer could be disastrous, however, so make sure it has a [[unicorn horn]]. A psychic blast could also wake the [[Wizard of Yendor]] before you're ready to deal with him. Their very large number of attacks per turn also make them very weak to [[passive attack]]s&mdash;keep them away from [[jelly|jellies]]!
*[[Minotaur]]s are fast, hit very hard, and are guaranteed to appear on a maze-type level. They have 0 [[MR]], so a [[scroll of taming]] is guaranteed to snare one on the first try (the [[spellbook of charm monster|spell of charm monster]] is of course dependent on your casting success rate).
*[[Skeleton]]s don't breathe, don't eat, slow monsters, wield weapons, and will resist cold, sleep, poison, petrification, and wands and fingers of death.  They are not randomly generated, but can be found in [[Orcus-town]] or produced by a polytrap or by polypiling unihorns.
*[[Troll]]s have good physical attacks, and if killed may revive tame. They may also revive hostile, however, so be careful. Make sure your other pets don't eat your former pet's corpse.
*[[Vampire]]s and [[vampire lord]]s don't breathe or eat, can fly, can wield all weapons and armor, and will regenerate. They are also immune to [[finger of death|death rays]]. But in 3.6 vampires now spontaneously turn into fog clouds, wolves, and—especially—vampire bats and remain in that form unless defeated in battle. Wolves and vampire bats do eat (and move fast enough to steal corpses from you) but they are nearly useless in battle compared to vampires. You can keep a vampire pet in its true form with a [[ring of protection from shape changers]].

==저주받은 아이템==

애완동물은 저주받은 아이템을 집지 않을 것입니다.

You can [[Curse-testing|curse-test]] items with your pet. Except when there is [[Diet#Pets|pet food]] on the same spot, pets do not like to step on or [[Hiding|hide]] under cursed items and will ''"move reluctantly"'' when they do. A [[leash]]ed or [[magic whistle|whistled]] pet will not reliably display the message. (주의: the [[dunce cap]]과 [[helm of opposite alignment]]는 입었을때 저주받습니다).  This is why cursed items in corridors can stand between you and your pet (see speed, above).

==Learning from pets==

Anthropomorphic pets can be sources of "transferrable (between sessions) knowledge"
in that observation of their [[weapon]]-wielding and [[armor]]-wearing preferences can yield information about the relative merits of such items, in general and in specific situations.

Observation of various pet species in combat (as well as of combat situations your pets seem to avoid) can also be very instructional.  For example, if you watch your pet attack a [[floating eye]], you will learn about their paralysis attack without experiencing it yourself.

Generally speaking, if a [[corpse]] is safe for your pet to eat, it is also safe for you.  The exceptions to this rule are that it is not a good idea for you to eat your own species, dogs, cats, bats (which will stun you) or violet fungi (which will make you hallucinate). Pets will also eat corpses from monsters such as [[Nymph|{{white|n}}]] and [[Leprechaun|{{monsym|leprechaun}}]] that could give you the often undesirable [[teleportitis]].

==애완동물 부활==
만약 당신의 애완동물이 죽었다면 [[Wand_of_undead_turning|완드]]나 [[Spellbook_of_turn_undead|spell]] of [[Turn_undead|turn undead]]를 사용해서 부활을 시도해볼수 있습니다.

==변종==
=== AceHack === 
[[AceHack]] implements ranged combat for pets; however, they currently die much faster than in vanilla, as monsters are more aggressive toward them. (This is planned to be fixed before release.)

=== dNetHack ===
[[dNetHack]] implements several changes and improvements for pets.

* Ranged combat and spellcasting is enabled for pets.
* Pets and hostile monsters will more actively seek out and attack each other.
* The total number of pets on the current dungeon level is limited to {{frac|3}} the character's [[charisma]] score.  If this limit is exceeded, the weakest pets will quickly untame, typically becoming peaceful.
* {{spell of|Charm monster}} and [[scroll of taming|scrolls of taming]] are now single-target spells.
* The character can now take any item from a pet using the #[[loot]] command, and may equip pets with armor using the #equip command.
** Armor now has an intrinsic size. Most pieces of armor must be the same size and the creature you want to wear the armor. Armor of unspecified size is Medium (human) sized.
*** Most armor found randomly in the dungeon is sized for humans.
** Body armor and helms also have an intrinsic shape.
*** Most armor and helms found randomly in the dungeon are shaped for humanoids (no modifier displayed).
*** Barded armor fits roughly animal-shaped creatures, such as dogs, cats, horses, lizards, and spiders.
*** Barded helms fit creatures with long heads, such as dogs, cats, horses, lizards, and snakes.
*** Segmented armor fits roughly-snake shaped creatures, mostly snakes and most nagas.
*** Snakeneck helms fit creatures with snake-like heads and necks attached to non-snake bodies. Examples are serpent men of Yoth, serpent-necked lionesses, bandersnatches, and jabberwocks.
*** Centaur armor fits creatures with humanoid torsos attached to roughly animal-shaped lower bodies, which includes proper centaurs as well as driders (sprow, however, have humanoid bodies).
*** Snakeleg armor fits creatures with humanoid torsos attached to serpentine lower bodies.  Examples include mariliths, salamanders, and ancient nagas.
*** Snakeback armor fits creatures with combined serpentine and animal-like body plan.  [[Deep Wyrm]]s and [[Deep Wyrmling]]s are the only such creatures.
* A new skill, beast mastery, is implemented. Higher skill improves pets' damage and AC, and cause pets further away to follow you downstairs. The skill is trained by witnessing your pets engaging in combat. Convicts, droven priests, dwarven nobles and wizards can get basic beast mastery, knights, elven, droven nobles and tourist can get skilled, and healers, troubadours, nobles and rangers can get expert.
* Two new commands, #wait and #come allows you to tell a pet to stay on the current level or follow you between levels as normal. These are useful if you want to have a pet not follow you but find it difficult to do so because of the increased follow range due to high beast mastery skill.

==== dNetHack preferred pets ====

* If wishing for a pet, the strongest non-unique angels are the best candidates.
** The counterpart of the vanilla Archon is the [[Throne Archon]], a high-damage spellcaster that favors the lightning bolt spell and can buff itself. Its large size makes it harder find equipment for.
** A [[Light Archon]] fires volleys of 7 (magically created) silver arrows for high potential damage against demons, but its large size and irregular body shape make equipping one difficult.
** A [[Surya Deva]] frequently casts ''mass cure'', healing all nearby peaceful monsters as well as the player.  Independent dancing blade means it can attack multiple targets per turn. It also casts ''fire pillar''. Its large size makes it harder to find equipment for, and each component of the Surya has a lower damage output than other choices. Fire damage is less useful than lighting.
** A [[Mahadeva]] deals very high single-target melee damage and has the highest base level (30). However, it is less effective against monsters with good AC, and its large size makes it harder to find equipment for.
** A [[Tulani Eladrin]] casts cold, shock, and fire damage spells, and its medium size means you can easily find and enchant a full set of armor for it. However, it can catch the player in fireball explosions. It has the lowest base level (18) and chooses spells randomly, so damage drops off against targets with resistances. It only uses one weapon attack per turn.
** An [[Ara Kamerel]] comes with a [[Kamerel Vajra]] and casts [[open wounds]] in combat, resulting in high single-target damage. It resists shock damage and petrification. It reincarnates using gold golems, though it reverts to level 15 in the process. Itsarge size makes it harder to find equipment for, and its speed of 9 is rather slow. It can be permanently killed by some enemies.
** An [[ancient of death]] inhales life and exhales death once per round, and is able to affect enemies through walls. However, its speed of 4 is very slow.
** An [[ancient of ice]] is a less useful version of the ancient of death, since more targets resist fire and ice.
* If searching the dungeon for endgame-capable pets:
** Lady [[Oona]] has a decent base level (20), and her medium size means you can easily find and enchant equipment for her.  She can wield weapons and casts a strong elemental damage spell. However, she is slow (speed 9), and her elemental damage spell is either fire, lightning, or cold, chosen randomly at the start of the game.
** [[Medusa]] has a decent base level (20), and her medium size means you can easily find and enchant equipment for her, though her snake-like lower body does complicate matters. She can wield weapons and has numerous natural attacks. She constantly petrifies anything able to see her, though MC3 armor will block this effect.
** A [[grue]] has a decent base level (20) and is very fast in the dark, with very high damage. It has a digestion attack and can be ridden. Its nonstandard body-type, making it unable to equip most types of armor. It can sometimes get itself killed by using its digestion attack.

'''#force''' is the [[extended command]] to unlock a [[container]] with a [[weapon]], either by prying or by smashing the lock.  
#force는 무기를 이용하여 자물쇠를 부수거나 prying 하는 식으로 상자를 여는 확장 명령어 입니다. 
It cannot be used on doors, you will instead get the message "You decide not to force the issue."
#force 명령어는 문에는 사용할 수 없으며 "You decide not to force the issue" (먼지 몰겟음 ㅎ) 라는 메세지가 나타납니다.

Prying with an edged weapon (such as a [[dagger]]) is a better method, as it will do no harm to the container and its contents. 
단검과 같이 날이 있는 무기를 사용하는 방식은 상자나 내용물에 피해를 주지 않기 때문에 좋은 방법입니다. 
However, it may break your weapon, so do not pry with your only (or best) weapon! 
하지만 무기가 부서질 수 있으니 당신의 유일한 ( 혹은 최고의 ) 무기로 잠긴 상자를 열지 마십시오.
Smashing the box with a blunt weapon (such as a [[mace]]) may destroy the whole container, including some or all of its contents. 
메이스와 같은 둔기로 상자를 부술 경우 내용물의 일부나 전체를 포함한 상자 전체가 파괴될 수 있습니다.
Otherwise, it would be best to leave the container until you have some means of unlocking it. 
아니면 상자의 자물쇠를 해제할 수 있을 때까지 상자를 내버려두는 것이 좋습니다.

턴 당 성공확률은 2x + 1% 이고, x = 무기가 대형 몬스터에게 주는 최대 기본 피해량입니다.
For example, a [[dagger]] deals 1d3 damage to large monsters, so the per-turn chance of success is <math>2*3+1=7%</math>. 
예를 들어, 단검은 대형 몬스터에게 1d3의 피해를 입히므로 턴당 성공 확률은 2 * 3 + 1 = 7 %입니다.

In [[SLASH'EM]], you can also use the force command on doors to bash it down with your weapon.

==SLASH'EM Extended==
In [[Slash'EM Extended]], you can also use the force command on monsters to deal some damage to them. This counts as a melee attack and will therefore set off a monster's passive attack, but unlike an actual melee attack it cannot miss. Also, sometimes the monster is knocked back a square. A [[Jedi]] deals extra damage by doing so.

&&%s&& %s Dancer {145765 2022-04-30T07:48:48Z {4000978 Aximili} link '''Dancer''' is a [[defunct features (SpliceHack)|defunct]] role in [[SpliceHack]]. Dancers were glass cannons, with little in the way of defense, but the ability to dish out enormous amounts of damage using a wide variety of techniques. They had a specific focus on dealing elemental damage. They were removed in SpliceHack 1.0.0.<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.0.0/doc/changelog.md</ref>

== Starting inventory ==
Each Dancer started with the following:
* A [[blessed]] +1 [[scimitar]]
* A [[melon]]
* A [[pumpkin]]
* An [[apple]]
* An [[orange]]
* A [[pear]]
* A random blessed [[spellbook]]
* A random blessed [[scroll]]

Dancers began the game with [[speed boots]] and the [[drum of earthquake]] already identified.

== Intrinsics ==
Dancers gained intrinsics at these [[experience level]]s:
* Level 1: [[Stealth]]
* Level 3: [[Fast]]
* Level 10: [[Searching]]

== Skills ==

== Techniques ==
Dancers could make use of the following techniques:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Technique'''
! '''Level'''
! '''Steps Required'''
! '''Description'''
|-
|'''Song of seasons'''
|1
|5
|Activate the elemental fist technique with no cooldown, if it is available.
|-
|'''[[Elemental fist]]'''
|1
|None
|As the monk technique. Deal elemental damage with unarmed attacks.

|Gain temporary water walking for 20-50 turns, or increase the current timeout for water walking by that many turns.
|-

|As the monk technique. Dash forwards through the air.
|-
|'''Flow breaker'''

|Create an earthquake, and cause nearby monsters to hurtle backward.
|-
|'''Summer storm step'''
|11
|10
|Fire a bolt of lightning in the direction of the last attack. This lightning bolt functions the same as a wand of lightning.
|-
|'''Detonation dance'''
|13
|25
|Explode in a 3x3 explosion for 2d4 fire damage. Unlike other techniques, this does not reset the step count, allowing for constant explosions.
|-
|'''Spellstrike slide'''
|None
|25
|Cast a known spell, ignoring failure rate. Learned upon killing the [[quest nemesis]].
|}

== Dancing ==
The central mechanic of the dancer role was dancing. Whenever a dancer hit a monster, they entered a state called '''dancing''', and their '''step count''' changed. The step count of a dancer changed via a number of different actions:

{|class="wikitable"
!Action
!Message
!Step Count Change
|-
|Hit a monster when the step count is zero.
|"You channel the energy of your attack and enter into a dance!"
|Step count = 5.
|-
|Take a turn.
|
|Step count - 1
|-
|Hit a monster when the step count is greater than zero.
|
|Step count + 2
|-
|Hit a monster, and reach the number of steps required for a technique in use.
|(Message specific to the technique in use)
|Step count = 0
|-
|Activate a dancer technique
|"You begin performing the [technique name]!"
|No change
|}

Dancer-specific techniques, notated by a required number of steps, functioned differently than techniques for other roles. Each dance functioned like a "stance" in other games: active until you stopped using it, and you could freely switch your active dance using #technique.

When a dance technique was active, the effects did not take place right away. Instead, the technique took effect when the dancer's step count reached a certain number of steps specific to the technique. Every time that a dancer hit a monster, if their step count was higher than the required steps of a currently active technique, an effect specific to that dance would occur. The dance would still be active, but the step count would be set to zero.

== Quest ==
The Dancer quest involved the player fighting the [[Time Elemental]] in an attempt to obtain [[the Power Pole]].

The '''pumpkin''' is a kind of [[comestible]] in ''[[SpliceHack]]''. 

==Effects==
It is considered [[vegan]] food, and gives 100 nutrition when eaten. Thrown pumpkins will "splat" and be wasted.

The pumpkin can be worn as a helmet. It provides a single point of AC, and can be enchanted.

==Strategy==
The pumpkin is a useful helmet in the early game, particularly if the player is trying to avoid [[encumbrance]], since it can be worn as a helmet until it is needed as a food source.

'''The Power Pole''' is a [[defunct features (SpliceHack)|defunct]] item in [[SpliceHack]]. It was the [[quest artifact]] for the defunct [[dancer]] role. It granted the carrier mastery over the elements.

== Invoking ==
[[Invoking]] the Power Pole gave the user resistance to [[acid]], [[fire]], [[cold]], and [[shock]] for 100-200 turns each. Additionally, invoking the power pole had the same effect as reading a [[blessed]] [[scroll of elementalism]].

&&%s&& %s Cooking {147982 2022-08-27T06:56:52Z {4000978 Aximili} Clearly marked as defunct, deletion not necessary '''Cooking''' is a [[defunct features (SpliceHack)|defunct]] skill in [[SpliceHack]]. Players could use cooking to alter their food for useful benefits.

== Mechanics ==

Cooking used the same mechanics as [[erosion]]. This meant that items that could be cooked were vulnerable to fire damage. Whenever a player or monster was dealt fire damage, there is a chance that their cookable items were affected. Items that could be cooked include:

* Fruits and vegetables.
* Corpses (except as specified below).

Invalid items include:
* Processed food.
* Corpses that are [[unsolid]].
* Corpses that are [[amorphous]].
* Corpses of [[undead]].
* Corpses of monsters that like fire.
* Inedible items.


There were three levels of cooking: Cooked, burnt, and crispy. It was possible to [[wish]] for food that could not be cooked by specifying that it be "uncookable," but no such items (aside from those already invalid) were naturally generated during the course of the game.

Monsters killed via fire usually left burned corpses. Cooked/burned corpses could not be sacrificed. Rotten and homemade tinned food was considered to be uncooked, but all other tins found by the player were treated as having a random amount of cooking. Corpses found in ice boxes had a small chance of being cooked.

Cooking in front of a monster of the same race as the corpse being cooked would cause them to become angry.

== Consuming cooked food ==

Cooking food modified the nutrition it provides, as well as the chance of gaining an intrinsic from a corpse. Cooked food was more beneficial than uncooked food, while burnt food was less beneficial.

== How to cook ==

Cooking was as easy as standing on the same tile as a [[furnace]], using the #cook [[extended command]], and selecting a valid item. There was a 1 / 1 + [cooking skill] chance that a mishap occured, causing the item to immediately become burned or crispy. If a mishap did not occur, the food would become cooked. The message that appeared depends on the cooking skill of the player.

== Cooking skill ==

|}

Cooking skill and [[intelligence]] were both exercised every time the player cooks a corpse using a furnace.

== Special corpses ==

Some corpses produced YAFM or an interesting effect when cooked.

{{message|You thoroughly defrost your winter wolf corpse.|Appears when cooking a [[winter wolf]]. The winter wolf corpse transforms into a [[wolf]] corpse instead of being cooked.}}
{{message|The giant skunk corpse explodes in your hands!|Appears when cooking a [[giant skunk]]. The corpse is destroyed, the player's intelligence is abused, and a large cloud of poison gas surrounds the player.}}
{{message|Yum, fried chicken!|Appears when cooking any sort of [[cockatrice]] corpse. This is considered interacting with the corpse for the purposes of stoning.}}
{{message|You get the sense that may have been a bad idea...|Appears when trying to cook the [[Wizard of Yendor]]. This prompts immediate harassment by the Wizard of Yendor.}}
{{message|That's some good 'burg.|Appears when cooking a [[cow]].}}

== Notable changes ==
* Dragons have adjectives that describe their age categories. The level of a dragon determines its age category.
** These categories are: "young", "very young", "juvenile", "adult", "mature", "old", "very old", "venerable", "eternal", "antediluvian", and "primeval".
* Dragons encountered in the dungeon have an age-category-based chance to have a cool name, like "Buzaulax".
* The higher level a dragon is, the more damage its breath weapon will deal.
* Different color dragons have slightly different anatomies:
** Blue dragons butt with a horn rather than using claws, and are slightly faster. Black dragons are treated as having a pair of horns, which they can butt with. Green dragons stalk the player.
* Dragons occasionally roar at the player. This can inflict the [[afraid]] status effect, making the player flee from the dragon.
** If you can see or hear the dragon, it will frighten you, so you'll need to be both blind and deaf in order to prevent this effect.
** Drinking [[booze|liquid courage]] dispels the Afraid condition.
* In order to offset their powerful abilities, dragons periodically slumber. Running from a dragon and hoping it decides to rest is a valid strategy.
