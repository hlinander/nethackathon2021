Only 3 '''metroid queens''' will appear in the dungeon.

Metroid queens wander around their dungeon level, laying eggs at irregular intervals. If zapped with a wand of death, a metroid queen will bud off three metroids.

A tame metroid queen will revert to peaceful at the start of her next turn.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|
Metroids appear to be able to sense the life energy of their prey as they have no visible sensory organs.

In their natural life cycle, Metroids gradually metamorphose to take a somewhat reptilian form, growing a hard organic shell, a head, and limbs, eventually shedding their gelatinous membrane completely. The shell removes their weakness to cold temperatures.  The egg-laying Metroid Queen appears to be the only form in which Metroids can normally reproduce, although many Metroid bioforms can divide almost instantaneously when exposed to certain kinds of high-energy radiation.

A '''hunting horror''' ({{yellow|w}}{{yellow|~}}{{yellow|~}}) is a multi-square monster in [[dNetHack]] similar to a [[long worm]].

Unlike long worms, hunting horrors never grow more than two tail segments, and will quickly regrow if one or both segments are lost. The severed tail of a hunting horror will also never become a new horror.

Hunting horrors move erratically, similar to [[giant bat]]s, and have a strong melee attack. Because of this, it can be beneficial to target the tail segments, which are not dangerous.

'''Bebeliths''' are a type of fantastic insect that can be encountered in [[dNetHack]].  Their biggest threat to the adventurer is their armor-damaging shred attack.  Each successful hit attempts to [[Disenchanter|disenchant]] a single piece of worn [[armor]].  If a piece of armor has been disenchanted to the point that its net contribution to [[AC]] is 0, the next shred attack that hits the item will destroy it.  Artifacts are immune to destruction by bebelith shred attacks, but not disenchantment.

Bebeliths follow the same movement rules as [[grid bug]]s; they cannot move diagonally.  Players can therefore use positioning to kill them without taking a hit.

'''Lillends''' are generated with six [[mask]]s in their inventory, and may substitute the attacks of the creature shown on a mask for their natural attack routine. Additionally, their songs buff nearby monsters.

* Song of courage: Buffs nearby (range 4) allied monsters, adding between one and {{sfrac|singer's level|3}} to each monster's attack and damage.
* Song of good health: Cures nearby (range 4) allied monsters of most status ailments (cancellation, laughter, blindness, berserk, paralysis, studied, stun, confusion, sleeping, frightened), resets their special attack cooldown, and heals them by up to their level in HP.
* Song of haste: Speeds up nearby (range 4) allied monsters, adding 12 movement points and granting them permanent intrinsic haste.

As a pet, a lillend's songs will buff other tame monsters, but will not buff the player. Lillendi will sing along with the player character, improving their songs. Lillendi also share the Troubadour's ''write me a saga'' special: each time they observe an allied monster gain experience, they also gain experience.

{{encyclopedia|
A lillend has the torso, arms, and head of a comely man or woman, 
but also has broad, powerful, feathered wings and a stout 
serpentine body from the waist downwards. Though the humanlike 
portions of a lillend are of unremarkable hue, the feathered and 
scaled parts of its anatomy are brightly colored and strikingly 
patterned. Each individual has its own unique color combination 
and is quite proud of it. A lillend wears no clothing but 
sometimes wears jewelry. It always carries weapons and musical 
instruments.

Lillendi social status depends on a simple system of initiations 
into mysteries and the ownership of certain totem masks. The 
mysteries are akin to secret societies, and each mystery is a 
specific kernel of wisdom passed on from one generation to the 
next. The more societies a lillend is a member of, the greater 
her status. Each society is devoted to particular musical forms, 
songs, instruments, and weapons, so a group of lillendi usually 
uses the same instruments, weaponry, and spells.

The masks are tangentially related to the societies, since each 
mask design belongs to a specific family, and long ago each 
family lived in a single lodge and wore a single type of mask. 
Things have gotten a little more complicated since then, but the 
masks still roughly indicate status and family affiliations.

'''Lady Oona''' is the guardian of the Third Key of Law in [[dNetHack]]. She lives in the Tower Donjon, the uppermost level of the [[Law Quest]].

Oona's elemental affinity changes from game to game, randomly choosing from fire, electricity, and cold.  Her elemental affinity determines the type of [[vortex|vortices]] and [[sphere]]s that spawn in the Law Quest.  For example, [[flaming sphere]]s indicate that Oona is fire-based.  Her elemental affinity can also be determined by her color, {{red|A}} for fire, {{cyan|A}} for cold, and {{brightblue|A}} for electricity.  Since her spellcasting attack deals 16d8 damage of the chosen element, confronting her without the appropriate elemental resistance is probably suicide. Even with the appropriate elemental resistance, Oona can deal damage via her ''lament'' song and her two weak physical attacks.

*Lament of flames/ice/storms:  Damages all nearby (range 3) hostile monsters  that ''resist'' Oona's elemental affinity.  Additionally, monsters that resist fire but not ice, or ice but not fire, take 1.5&times; damage. Base damage is <span class="nowrap">({{sfrac|singer's level|3}})d4,</span> max 10d4. Lament can't kill targets; they will be left with at least 1 HP. If Oona is hostile, this song also affects the player character.
*Dirge: Debuffs all nearby (range 4) hostile monsters. Monsters receive a &minus;1&nbsp;&minus; {{sfrac|singer's level|3}} penalty to to-hit and damage.
*Slow march: Slows down nearby (range 3) hostile monsters, adding 12 movement points and permanently [[Slow monster|slowing]] them.

Once Lady Oona is slain, vortices and spheres will cease spawning in the Law Quest.

Lady Oona can be [[tame]]d, and makes a very powerful pet, albeit less useful against enemies that resist her element type.  Her weak physical attacks can be greatly boosted through proper equipment, possibly including an artifact weapon and gauntlets of power.  As a human-sized [[angelic being]], she can wear most forms of armor, including [[crystal plate mail]] and a [[cloak of magic resistance]], and as a lawful creature she can wield lawful artifacts, such as Excalibur.  Furthermore, she resists most forms of instant death, including disintegration, petrification, and polymorph.  When facing foes that are vulnerable to her element type, she will attack with her spell.  When facing foes that resist her element, she will use her songs. Note that she will not drop the Third Key of Law until she is killed, so you will need to kill her if you want all 9 keys. 

Oona will always be generated with a +3 metallic stiletto and a +3 metallic long sword. They all have the axiomatic weapon property, which adds +d8 against non-lawful creatures, in addition to a varying elemental damage for another +d8. If Oona is cold-based, the stiletto will be "forge-hot" (flaming) and the long sword "arcing" (shocking). If Oona is fire, the stiletto will be "arcing" and the long sword "crystalline" (freezing). If Oona is shock, the stiletto will be "crystalline" and the long sword "forge-hot". These are acceptable weapons in their own right, but more importantly the sword can be #named into Claideamh or Kusanagi no Tsurugi (for Samurai only), in addition to being dippable to become Excalibur. This can make quite a strong end-game weapon, depending on the elements you roll.

The '''sprow''' is a [[centaur]]-like creature that can be encountered in [[dNetHack]].

Sprow are [[drow]] who have been converted into a [[humanoid]]&ndash;[[spider]] hybrid. Unlike the similar [[drider]]s, sprow have the least advantageous aspects of each creature, with a humanoid torso, but arms and legs replaced by pairs of spider legs. The transformation, which renders the drow unable to pick up items and use weapons, is understood to be a form of punishment.

The '''drider''' is a [[centaur]]-like creature that can be encountered in [[dNetHack]]. 

Driders are [[drow]] who have been converted into a [[humanoid]]&ndash;[[spider]] hybrid, retaining the humanoid upper body but replacing the legs with an eight-legged spider body. Unlike the similar [[sprow]], driders have arguably the best aspects of both creatures, but because of their deformity they are outcasts from drow society, and the transformation is generally considered a form of punishment.

Pseudodragons are a creation of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. They resemble true dragons superficially, but are usually far smaller and far more docile, which makes them suitable as familiars (pets) for wizards. They do not usually grow to the sizes they can have in dNetHack.

The '''Pen of the Void''' is an [[artifact weapon|artifact]] [[athame]] that appears in [[dNetHack]]. It is the guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]] for the [[Binder]], and is enhanced into their [[quest artifact]].

==Single-blade form==
Before the quest nemesis is slain, the Pen is a normal athame, though it can be enchanted to only +5 max (attempts to overenchant the Pen simply fail). In this form, the pen can store one [[Spirits (dNetHack)|spirit]] (as detailed below) and has no #invoke effect. Reading the Pen will show that it was once a dual-bladed athame, but the second blade has been snapped off. Note that for a non-binder the Pen will always be single bladed, as the double bladed form requires you have both killed your nemesis and also are a Binder.

==Dual-blade form==
After the quest nemesis is slain, the Pen deals double damage, can be enchanted to +10, and can store two spirits. The effects of each spirit also increase. In this form the Pen can be #invoked to activate the Void Chime power. Reading the Pen will show that it now has both blades.

==Void Chime==
Invoking the restored Pen activates the Void Chime power. For the next 5 turns, any spirits stored in the blade count as being bound to the character as well, and all spirits bound to the player count as being in the Pen. While the Void Chime is sounding, breaking a spirit's taboo does not unbind it. The Void Chime also resets the cooldowns of all spirit powers.

==Pen binding==

If a Binder with no free slots attempts to bind a spirit while wielding the Pen of the Void, the spirit may instead be stored in the Pen. The spirit's binding timeout is set as normal, and its seal appears on the Pen. Spirits stored in the Pen do not grant their usual abilities, and the character is not subject to their taboos. Instead, each spirit modifies the Pen in some way. If the Pen is still single-bladed, you may only bind one spirit inside it. The dual-bladed pen can store two spirits. Reading the pen will tell you what spirits are inside it.
