&&%s&& %s Insight {147486 2022-08-12T22:09:33Z {4001605 NetSysFire} /* Insight weapons */ - whitespace '''Insight''' is a feature specific to [[dNethack]]. It represents the player's ability to see "beyond the veil": Players with a high insight will encounter creatures they would otherwise never see.

== The Veil ==

The 'veil' refers to a perception of reality that is permanently altered by the following actions:

* Reading the [[DNetHack artifacts#The Necronomicon|Necronomicon]] or the [[DNetHack artifacts#The Book of Lost Names|Book of Lost Names]].
* Successfully binding any [[spirit]].
* Entering the [[Lost Cities]].
* Playing as an [[Anachrononaut]], [[Binder]] or [[Madman]].
* Discovering the presence of [[The Black Mother]] and sacrificing to her.
* Drinking a potion of goat's milk.
* Turning traitor in the shared Hedrow Quest.
* Receiving a telepathic message from an [[elder brain]] (possible in the [[Drow Noble Quest]]).
* Being told terrible truths by an [[Apocalypse angel]].

While the 'veil' is intact, the PC has a +10 bonus to [[sanity]] regeneration. Once the 'veil' has been pierced, insight can be accrued and reduced.

== Insight creatures ==
There are a number of creatures that the character will be unable to perceive until they have accrued sufficient Insight. While a creature is unseen, the character will be unable to harm it in any way. However, many of these monsters will still be able to affect the character while unseen.

==Insight merchants ==
In the Gulf of N'Kai on the [[Neutral Quest (dNethack)|Neutral Quest]], you can encounter a number of peaceful merchants. If you [[chat]] to them while wielding an artifact in your main hand, they will offer to take it from you, giving you a "thought" in return.<ref>https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dnethack/blob/master/dnethack-3.4.3/src/sounds.c|2716</ref> Giving away a gifted artifact will anger the god that gave it to you.

You may have up to three thoughts in your head at once. Thoughts cannot be involuntarily removed, but are only active when you have sufficiently high insight (equal to the lowest possible value that could be required to see the corresponding merchant). Thoughts can be voluntarily removed with a trephination kit, the aid of a nurse, or the aid of a veil render. Removing a thought results in a glyph, which can be read to return the thought to your head, as long as the character meets the minimum insight requirement.

Thoughts may also be obtained directly via glyphs. Glyphs may be wished for, found in bones files left by characters with thoughts, or, in the case of beast's embrace glyphs, left as treasure by monsters. Characters must still meet the minimum insight requirement in order to read the glyph.

==Living doll merchants==
Living dolls appear randomly in the Depths within the Neutral Quest. Before reaching their insight threshold, they appear as "lifeless dolls", an object that functions as a living doll corpse. Each doll has an independent threshold of rnd(20) insight. Their corpses can be transported to a more convenient location. After reaching their insight threshold, they will wake up and appear as peaceful {{brightmagenta|'}} that sell a variety of dolls when you #[[chat]] to them. <ref>https://github.com/Chris-plus-alphanumericgibberish/dnethack/blob/master/dnethack-3.4.3/src/sounds.c|2211</ref>

If a doll or an android given a doll tear is killed, it will drop its items on the ground and leave a lifeless doll corpse. This corpse will revive again, following the same rules as the first awakening.

Living dolls will always sell doll tears and 9 to 11 random other dolls from the below table. For the dolls that grant an effect for a certain number of turns, they will always add to a pre-existing timer. Each doll costs 800 zorkmids regardless of charisma; a doll tear costs 8000 zm.

== Kuker ==
[[Kuker]] are peaceful angelic creatures that spawn in the Neutral Quest once your insight is high enough. They offer several services in exchange for exorbitant amounts of money. They also grudge on any undead creatures on the level they are found on, and are often not strong enough to fight too many of them. So come prepared to buy anything you want, and don't dally when going to reach them.

==Insight weapons==
Insight weapons are unusual weapons that gain additional to-hit and damage dice when used by [[Madman_(dNetHack_role)|Madmen]] or [[Spirits_(dNetHack)#Ose.2C_Dreamer_in_a_Drowned_City|Ose]] binders. Many insight weapons also gain additional effects once the PC passes certain insight thresholds; any PC can benefit from these effects. There are at least two thresholds for extra effects, with the exact amount and thresholds depending on the weapon, and the weapon's appearance will often have adjectives added to indicate which thresholds have been passed.

The Madman and Ose-binder bonus to-hit die's size is determined by the lower of the PC's Insight score and their level. Therefore, the maximum to-hit bonus is +1d30, for a PC of 30th level with at least 30 points of insight.

The Madman and Ose-binder bonus damage die's size is determined by halving the lower of the PC's Insight score and their level. When using a two-handed weapon, the PC's effective level is doubled. Therefore, for a one-handed weapon the maximum damage bonus is +1d15, for a PC of 30th level with at least 30 points of insight. For a two-handed weapon the maximum damage bonus is +1d30, for a PC of 30th level with at least 60 points of insight.

| 1-50

|-
| 25
| Sidereal (replaces "sparkling")
| Gains an additional +2% magic damage per two points of insight over 25, limited by your charisma score (and so capping out at +.5x at 75 insight and 25 charisma). Additionally [[discourage|discourages]] the target, inflicting 1 point of discouragement per 5 points of charisma. Discouragement from multiple hits stacks, capping out at your charisma score plus the blade's enchantment value.
|-
| 50
| Sticky
| Causes the target to attack a nearby enemy of the blade's wielder. The target gains a bonus to-hit and damage for this attack equal to 1 point per 5 points of charisma and insight. If a monster kills an ally, it may go insane. If the player kills a pet, their god may become angry as normal. Monsters receive a magic resistance roll to resist this effect, unless the blow from the blade dealt enough damage to kill them. The player is always affected.

| 15-30
| Severed/Thrashing arm
| ''The Ibite arm behaves like a lurking one arm. The hand deals blunt damage rather than piercing/slashing.''
|-
| 40
| 
| The arm begins attacking nearby monsters of its own accord. If wielded, it may choose to attack any enemy within 2 squares. If it is in the swap weapon slot, it may choose to attack any adjacent enemy.
|-
| 50
| 
| The arm begins casting spells of its own accord. Any enemy within 8 squares may be targeted. It chooses from Plague, Acid Rain, Geyser, Open Wounds, and Psi Bolt. During gibbous moons it can also cast Fire Pillar.
|-
| 60
| 
| The arm will summon an army of ibite ghosts when #invoked. Summons 6d6 beings of Ib and 3d3 priests of Ib at random locations across the level. Beings of Ib are a kind of ghost with a 6d6 acid touch, and Priests of Ib are similar but level 15 vs. level 10 and have clerical spellcasting instead. They are summoned for a duration scaling with charisma, enchantment, and your missing sanity.
|-
| rowspan=2 | '''Rakuyo''' (property)
| 20
| Blood-drenched
| The rakuyo also strikes one square behind the original target with a blade of rotted blood. The player can force-attack empty squares to trigger the effect.
|-
| 40
| Burning
| A flaming explosion also erupts one square behind the original target. The player can force-attack empty squares to trigger the effect.

&&%s&& %s Sanity {147488 2022-08-12T22:19:17Z {4001605 NetSysFire} /* Permanent Madnesses */ - fix annoying space '''Sanity''' is a feature specific to [[dNethack]]. It represents the player's mental well-being in response to the various horrors encountered during the game.

As a player's sanity rating drops below 100, a player becomes susceptible to various delusions, compulsions, and conditions that may be inflicted during the game. 

==Natural sanity regeneration==
Sanity recovers naturally up to a threshold determined by the character's [[Wisdom]] score and modified by a number of factors. Sanity recovers quickly (1 point per 10 turns) up to 1x the modified wisdom score, somewhat slower (1 point per 32 turns) up to 2x the modified wisdom score, and more slowly still (1 point per 100 turns) up to 3x the modified wisdom score.

Natural sanity regeneration will never *lower* your current sanity score, even if penalties result in a negative effective wisdom.

=== Modifiers to effective wisdom ===
* If the [[Insight|veil]] is intact, the PC receives a +10 bonus wisdom.
* If the veil has been pierced, the PC suffers a penalty equal to the log-base-two of the PC's insight.
* If the PC has the Transparent Sea thought, they receive a +30 bonus.
* Elves receive a +3 bonus.
* Orcs suffer a -3 penalty.
* Binding Orthos inflicts a -5 penalty.
* Wearing equipment that imposes a healing penalty ("You feel itchy.") imposes the same penalty to effective wisdom as well.
* Certain roles receive a modifier to effective wisdom:

==Madnesses==
These are the various afflictions, or "madnesses", that can take effect as your sanity is lowered:

===Temporary madnesses===
{| class="wikitable" width="80%"
! style="width: 25%;" | Affliction
! style="width: 75%;" | Description
|-
| Panicking
| The most common effect. Base accuracy is reduced to -5 (overriding all to-hit bonuses from level), and all the PC's attacks do half damage. Spell failure rate is set to 100% for all spells that are not emergency spells or from the escape school. Wand power skill is reduced to base level. The PC gains two bonus movement points per round (+1/6th of the base movement rate). The player should consider running away from combat while their character is panicking. 
|-
| Stumbling Blindly
| The character acts as though [[blind]] and [[confused]].
|- 
| Staggering in Shock
| The character acts as though [[stun]]ned.
|- 
| Babbling
| The character begins babbling incoherently, preventing the casting of spells and the reading of scrolls, spellbooks, and syllables. Creatures within a range of squares nearby - equal to {{frac|3}} of the character's constitution score - learn the character's exact location. The character is also unable to #chat to monsters.
|- 
| Screaming
| The character begins screaming, preventing the casting of spells and the reading of scrolls and spellbooks - however, syllables can still be read while screaming. <stub: effects of "song noise">. The character is also unable to #chat to monsters.
|}

===Permanent Madnesses===

These madnesses are mostly conferred by seeing certain monsters, usually demon lords/princes. Detecting the monsters through telepathy, monster detection, and so on (probably?) does not give you the madness.

==Restoring sanity==
The following actions will quickly restore sanity:

* Drinking a [[potion of sleeping]] (taking a 'sedative'). Blessed potions restore 15 sanity, uncursed 10, and cursed potions 5.
* Using an effigy will restore half the sanity needed to get you back to 100.
* Successfully reading the [[DNetHack artifacts#The Necronomicon|Necronomicon]] or the [[DNetHack artifacts#The Book of Lost Names|Book of Lost Names]] will restore 1 sanity. A failed reading will cause you to lose 1 sanity instead.
* Killing a monster that would also increase your [[Insight]] rating.
* Drinking a noncursed [[potion of restore ability]]; blessed potions heal 20 sanity, while uncursed ones heal 5.
* Drinking a [[potion of booze]] of any beatitude restores 5 sanity. Past your [[potion of booze#dNethack|drunkenness]] limit, this only goes to a maximum of 50 sanity.
* Receiving a course of tranquilizers from a [[nurse]]. This behaves like a blessed sleeping potion, with 15 sanity restored per course.

&&%s&& %s The Black Mother {148281 2022-10-01T18:43:15Z {4000354 Chris} Begin splitting cults into their own pages '''The Black Mother''' is a chaotic aligned [[cult]] deity.

==Sacrificing to the Black Mother==
To make offerings, you must sacrifice to a special monster called a [[mouth of the goat]]. One mouth is found in the upper left room of the 6th level of the Lost Cities, and another in the bottom right on the 7th level. These monsters have an innate [[insight]] limit of 60, and will accept your sacrifices on her behalf; if you cannot perceive the mouth, then you must stand on its square and offer corpses there. If you can, any square adjacent to the mouth is acceptable.

A mouth of a goat will attempt to eat any corpse that is dropped on its square; a corpse eaten in this way only counts for favor if you carry a holy symbol. The message given when a corpse is eaten in any way is "A mouth forms from the mist and eats a <foo> corpse!".

Additionally, once you have had the Goat drool on a weapon of yours, any corpses left by a monster killed by it will be sacrificed to the Black Mother, earning you favor as usual.

===Sacrifice Rules===
The Black Mother has unique rules for accepting offerings.

# She does not eat her own minions. She will reject any goat spawn, any centaurs, any nymphs, any unicorns, any mi-go, dark young, blessed, swirling mists, dust/ice/thunder/fire storms, or mouths of the goats themselves. Attempting to sacrifice one will anger her and cause the sacrifice to revive adjacent to you.
# Attempting to feed a Rider to her angers her and revives the corpse.
# She will not eat the true Amulet of Yendor. ("The Amulet proves inedible.") Cheap plastic imitations cannot be offered.
# She WILL eat 'old' corpses, unlike other gods, but with minimal corpse value for luck and prayer timeout purposes.
# The Black Mother frowns upon same-race sacrificing for non-chaotics. However, no demons will ever be summoned as a result of the offering. Anachrononauts and Binders have no penalty for same-race sacrifice, even if not chaotic.

If the corpse has not been revived at this point, the sacrifice is accepted. This will earn favor, but anger any non-chaotic deities. Additionally, a successful sacrifice will pacify all of her minions on the same level as you.

== Boons of the Goat ==

== Holy Symbol of the Black Mother ==
The Black Mother first provides her devotees with a holy symbol ("tarnished triple goat head" when un-identified) to prove their faith.

Applying a holy symbol will allow you to (attempt) to spend favor on boons.

Burying a holy symbol, possibly via dropping it into a pit and covering it with a boulder, will begin a timer for 250+d250 turns. When the timer runs out, the floor will "boil to a black mist" and a hoofprint will be burned into on the floor. This summons a mouth of the goat at that spot, allowing you to continue your worship there.

If you are holding a holy symbol in open inventory, any time you kill a monster on an eligible sacrifice spot, they are considered sacrifices even if you didn't #offer the corpse.

After obtaining the symbol, you will be able to purchase other boons in exchange for favor.

== Drooling object property ==
The Drooling property is the major reason to worship the black goatEach turn, an item with this property appearance may change appearance. The adjectives used can shift to 'drooling', 'staring', 'lashing', or 'stormwrapped', with its abilities changing as the name changes. 
*Drooling: Deals 2x acid damage
*Staring: Adds study to the target (reducing its AC and increasing the damage it takes on the next attack) by the base damage rolled that turn, plus the enchantment of the item.
*Lashing: Deals 2x poison and 4d4 physical damage
*Stormwrapped: Picks a random elemental damage type and deals a variable amount of damage of that type. It has even odds of 3d10 fire damage, 3d8 cold damage, 3d8 shock damage, or 4d4 acid damage.

When a monster is killed by a drooling weapon and leaves a corpse, it will be automatically sacrificed to the Black Mother. This will not give gifts, but can mollify the Black Mother. However, this will still anger either your god or the Black Mother herself as normal, depending on your alignment and the sacrifice. Be careful killing monsters like [[Riders]] with a drooling weapon.

=== Red Word of Knowledge ===

The Red Word is one of the words of creation, part of the same set as the words in the Mithardir quest. Reading the word has the following effects:

*Gives a permanent +2 to your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, surpassing racial maximums but not exceeding 25.
*Applies a passive bonus of +3 to your pet cap, on top of the Charisma bonus.
*Provides an active ability to speak the Red Word on an rnz(100) timeout. Priests receive a -20% discount to this timeout. Speaking the word causes all monsters you can see to make an MR check (no bonuses from item class). On a fail they attempt to flee, are permanently crazed, and try to disrobe. Peaceful and tame monsters are still subject to the effects.

== Blessings of the Black Mother ==
If you did not receive an artifact gift, but are still in good standing, you may receive a generic blessing from the Black Mother. This has a chance of roughly 1/(30+experience level), biased to be more likely with higher luck.

First, the Black Mother may gift a tame minion, which will be one of the minions she summons when angered. Otherwise, one of the following effects occurs:
*Acts as a blessed scroll of remove curse, unpunishing you as well, with the message "You feel like someone is helping you."
*Fully maximizes your luck with the message "You feel very lucky."
*Grants the acrid [[Object properties#dNetHack|object property]] to a wielded weapon. The weapon must not be an artifact, be a proper weapon or weapon tool, and not have the sizzling or acrid property already. This will repair erosion and erodeproof the weapon, but not repair any enchantment. If the property was not granted, the boon is lost. This gives the message "Acid drips from your weapon."
*If you are sterile, cures sterility with the message "You feel fertile." If you were not sterile, the boon is lost.
*Gifts you 1d8 potions of goat's milk, with the message that "Some potions appear at your feet!". This effect has a triple chance of occurring compared to the other effects.

=== Goat's Milk ===
Potions of goat's milk are a reasonably common reward for interacting with the Black Goat. For all intents and purposes they are normal potions, but always appear as a "black potion" when unidentified. This appearance may be shared with another randomized potion.

When drunk, they function as an advanced [[potion of full healing]]. If they are blessed, they will restore all lost levels, but otherwise will always restore one even if uncursed. They also restore one ability score if uncursed and all if blessed, and always cure one morgul shard. However, drinking goat's milk will decrease your [[sanity]] by d20, and give you the goat-ridden madness if you did not already have it.

Cursed potions have none of the above effects, but are instead spoiled. A spoiled potion deals a flat 40 damage and gives you food poisoning.

== Madness of the Black Mother ==
Any being maddened by the Black Mother has tentacles growing out of their head. This applies to some of her chosen children, and you as well if you have the goat-ridden madness.

If you have the madness, your brain occasionally sprouts writhing masses of tentacles. The madness triggers when a monster (hostile or peaceful, but not tame) is adjacent to you, and a sanity roll fails.

The outburst initially gives the message "Lashing tentacles erupt from your brain!" and deals 4d4 damage to you, scaled by your current HP percentage. This also drains 4d4 nutrition. The tentacles erupting will reduce your sanity by 4d4, but only by 1 per outburst when your sanity is below 50. The only upside of the lashing tentacles is the damage it deals to enemies. It will make a 4d4 poisonous tentacle attack to all non-tame monsters adjacent to you as a free action. 

On enemies, the madness will trigger every single turn, but does not damage them. The enemies also don't always make 4d4 poisonous tentacle attacks, but have their own versions. The enemies that have attacks are:

* Swirling mists: 3d8 hungry mist that splashes you with water
* Dust storm: 3d8 blinding hungry mist
* Ice storm: 3d8 freezing hungry mist
* Thunder storm: 3d8 shocking hungry mist
* Fire storm: 3d10 fiery hungry mist
* Mouth of the goat: 4d4 elemental acid hungry mist
* Blessed: 5/8 chance of 4d4 poisonous tentacles, 1/8 chance of 4d4 study gaze, 1/8 chance of 4d4 physical weapon attack, 1/8 chance of 5d8 clerical spellcasting
* Mistweavers: 4d4 poisonous tentacle

These attacks will trigger against all adjacent monsters hostile to the attacker.

'''완전 회복의 물약'''은 최대 400의 HP를 안정적으로 치료할 수 있고 많은 부정적인 영향을 치료할 수 있습니다.

== 효과 ==

[[quaff|마셨]]을때, 최대 400의 HP를 치료하는 것 외에, 그 물약은 가끔씩 당신의 최대 체력을 증가시킬 수 있습니다.

If an extra 400 HP would be more HP than your maximum, a blessed potion will also increase your maximum HP by 8, and an uncursed potion will increase it by 4; a cursed potion will not increase your maximum HP. 해당 물약은 또한 [[hallucination|환각]]과 [[blindness|실명]]을 치료하며, 그리고 [[constitution]]와 [[strength|힘]]을 [[exercise|훈련]]시킵니다, 그리고 만약 저주받지 않았다면, [[sickness|질병]]을 치료할 것입니다.  

만약 당신에게 잃은 [[experience level|경험치]]가 있다면, 축복받은 물약은 하나를 회복시키지만, 그 과정에서 당신의 최대 경험치 레벨이 하나 감소합니다. 예를 들어, 만약 당신이 레벨 14이고 레벨 4를 잃어서 10으로 떨어졌다면, 축복받은 완전 회복의 물약을 사용해서 당신의 레벨을 11로 올리고 최대 기억된 레벨이 13으로 될 것입니다. Even if you want to restore the remaining levels with a [[potion of restore ability]], you will not be able to restore it back to 14. By using only full healing potions, you can restore up to half of your lost levels.

Inhaling [[vapors]] (of potion of any [[beatitude]]) will heal you 3 HP, up to your maximum HP, 그리고 constitution을 훈련시킵니다. 만약 당신이 폴리모프 상태라면, 기본 폼 상태의 체력도 조정됩니다.{{refsrc|potion.c|1600|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

당신은 이 물약을 [[Pestilence|역병]]에게 던지거나 그것으로 때려서 그에게 피해를 줄수도 있습니다.

독이 있는 무기를 완전 회복의 물약에 담그는 것은 독 코팅을 제거할 것입니다.

== 감정 ==

해당 물약은 시작부터 하나도 가지고 시작하지 않아도, 치유사들에게 감정되어 있습니다.

만약 몬스터가 이런 물약을 가지고 있다면 그들은 HP가 낮으면 그것을 마시려고 할 것이며 당신을 위해 그것이 식별될 것입니다.

==전략==

If this potion's [[Randomized appearance|appearance]] is smoky or milky, you may get a [[djinn]] or a [[ghost]] when you quaff it. This is great if you need a [[wish]], but not so great if you have 3 HP left and were expecting to be fully healed. For this reason, it's not a good idea to rely on potions of full healing as a poor man's [[amulet of life saving]] in these rare cases.

[[alchemy|연금술]]에서, 해당 물약은 [[potion of gain ability|gain ability의 물약]]을 만들기 위해 [[potion of gain energy|gain energy의 물약]] 또는 [[potion of gain level|gain level의 물약]]과 합칠수 있습니다. It can be produced by combining a [[potion of extra healing]] with a [[potion of gain energy]] or [[potion of gain level|gain level]].
