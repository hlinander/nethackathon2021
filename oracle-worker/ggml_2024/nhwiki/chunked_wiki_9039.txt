your host of friends will completely precede you.
That will be my present to you, my friend."
And after these words he fell down backwards,
restrained by the all-restrainer Hupnos.
His monstrous neck slid into the dust;
the red wine squirted from his throat;
the drunk vomited lumps of human flesh.

{{questmon|Ixoth|Knight|nemesis}} He is a [[red dragon]] that guards the [[Bell of Opening]] and the Knight's [[quest artifact]], the [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]]. Strangely, the default tileset gives him an identical appearance to [[Nalzok]] and the [[Minion of Huhetotl]].

Like any other red dragon, eating Ixoth's [[corpse]] or [[tin]] is guaranteed to confer [[fire resistance]]. 

==Generation==
Ixoth will always generate at the same point on [[The Dragon's Lair|the goal level]], deep within his dark cavern; he sits meditating next to the entrance of a small subsection where he stores his hoard.

Ixoth will always leave a [[corpse]] upon death due to his size, but does not drop any scales unlike normal red dragons.

==Strategy==
Approaching Ixoth can be difficult due to the layout and darkness of his cave; unless you have [[stealth]], he will likely become aware of your presence and [[teleport]] next to you while you are navigating the innermost bend. As with all [[covetous]] monsters, it may be more ideal to engrave [[Elbereth]] or drop a [[scroll of scare monster]] on the stairs and awaken him from there.

In practice, Ixoth will not use his fire breath unless he has teleported to the upstair to heal, since his [[covetous]] behavior will keep him in melee range. The [[magic resistance]] from the Magic Mirror of Merlin will prevent a [[wand of polymorph]] [[wand of death|or death]] from working on him, but not the [[wand of sleep]]. Magic resistance of your own is recommended to protect your items from [[monster spell]]s such as [[curse items]] and [[destroy armor]].

If you are [[mount]]ed on a fast steed and are at least [[Skilled]] in [[lance]], you can use your movement speed to potentially [[joust]] Ixoth to death, especially if you can lure him out while remaining on the upstair. Note that while Ixoth will be unable to attack on most turns after being stunned from the joust, it is likely that he may recover before you can joust again, giving him a turn or two to try and attack or else flee to the upstairs.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|A scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any @ monster or any [[unique]] monster.

Ixoth is now [[steadfast]] due to his size, and he can knock you backwards with his melee attacks - this can fling you off a saddled mount and result in [[wounded legs]], as well as forcing you away from the up stairs, and makes it dangerous to remain near water for any amount of time. Jousting will no longer force him backward into pounding range, but can still [[stun]] him and likely grant you some extra turns to deal significant damage with further jousting.}}

==Variants==
===Biodiversity patch===
In any game with the [[biodiversity patch]], Ixoth is no longer a red dragon, but instead the white-colored '''Hwitwyrm''', though his attacks and attributes remain the same.

===dNetHack===
Ixoth appears in [[dNetHack]], but his role as the quest nemesis guarding the Knight's quest artifact is given to [[Nimune]] - Ixoth instead appears as a hostile monster on the home level, taking part in the siege of [[King Arthur]]'s castle.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Ixoth has a stronger hit die for his claw attacks, and he is additionally given [[poison resistance]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
Ixoth shares his encyclopedia entry with all other dragons.
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail, the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
{{right-align|[ Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]}}

"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's not a trick of mastering the dragons, as most people think. Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with a dragon:  will he talk to you or will he eat you?  If you can count upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why then you're a dragonlord."

{{questmon|Nalzok|Priest|nemesis}} He is almost identical to the [[Minion of Huhetotl]], the [[Archeologist]] [[quest nemesis]]. The only differences are his far stronger chaotic alignment and his slightly higher [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]]. As a major [[demon]] quest nemesis, he shares the usual immunities to [[fire resistance|fire]], [[poison resistance|poison]], [[level drain]]ing, and [[stoning resistance|stoning]].

==Strategy==
Since Nalzok is almost identical to the Minion of Huhetotl, some of the strategies that apply there will also apply to him: Nalzok hates silver and respects [[Elbereth]] and a grounded [[scroll of scare monster]], and can [[summon nasties]] much like the Minion.

Unlike the Minion, clearing the surrounding area of monsters beforehand should be even easier, especially with the #[[turn undead|turn]] command making short work of most [[zombie]]s and [[wraith (monster class)|wraiths]] - note that he can wake up early and get a few swings in during the 3 (or less) turns that you're immobilized. An AC of around &minus;15 with a source of [[magic resistance]] is advisable, as is the usual strategy of standing on/blocking/teleporting to the upstair, then awakening and engaging Nalzok there - be mindful of the lava plain and the fire traps during the fight, as one misstep can easily end the game.

A blessed and enchanted silver and/or artifact weapon (e.g. [[Frost Brand]], [[Grayswandir]], [[Magicbane]], etc.) should be enough to make the fight against Nalzok easier - priests should have no shortage of [[holy water]] to bless both the weapon and {{scroll of|enchant weapon}} scrolls with.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any [[unique]] monster.}}

{{questmon|Scorpius|Ranger|nemesis}} He is a [[scorpion]] that guards the [[Bell of Opening]] and the Ranger's [[quest artifact]], [[the Longbow of Diana]].

Eating Scorpius's corpse is guaranteed to convey [[poison resistance]], but the corpse is itself [[poisonous]].

==Generation==
Scorpius will always generate atop his [[throne]] at the center of [[Ranger quest#The Cavern of Scorpius|his would-be castle]], where he sits meditating.

==Strategy==
The damage Scorpius deals with his two claw attacks is moderate, but manageable - the true danger lies in his third attack, a [[sickness]]-inducing sting. An attentive Ranger with a blessed [[unicorn horn]] and/or other methods of curing sickness (e.g. [[eucalyptus leaf|eucalyptus leaves]] and potions of {{! of|extra healing|full healing|or=1}}) may find Scorpius among the easier quest nemeses to defeat. [[Pet]]s that are strong enough to attack Scorpius and weather his clawing strikes have nothing to fear from his diseased sting, which deal no damage to other monsters.

Scorpius moves at the same base speed as you - with fast speed or better, you should have a few openings to attack him before he can teleport away. A [[scroll of scare monster]] or boulder fort on the up [[stair]] is an excellent defensive measure, as he lacks any sort of ranged or spellcasting attack, and his pitiful 10 AC makes it very easy to finish him off. Another method is to maintain line-of-sight with the up stair as you approach Scorpius: you can then snipe at him using whatever [[missile]]s you have on hand (e.g., your [[bow]] and a stack of enchanted arrows) and scare him towards the up stair. As long as you maintain enough distance, continued fire should drop Scorpius in a matter of turns.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any [[unique]] monster.

Scorpius's disease-inducing sting dealing no damage to monsters is a part of [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/issues/594 issue #594], which concerns [[the Riders]] and other monsters sharing their attack types being unable to damage other monsters in combat, and was fixed in {{commit|017a8687e0b541a8e5848ef3037e25dc819208ca|commit 017a868}}.}}

==History==
Scorpius was introduced along with the Ranger role, [[quest]] and quest artifact in [[NetHack 3.3.0]].

As Scorpius is an [[oviparous]] monster, it is possible to wish for a "Scorpius [[egg]]"; in [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and previous versions, this wish would be granted, though said egg would never actually hatch since Scorpius is a [[unique monster]]. Starting in [[NetHack 3.6.0]], {{commit|029ca9f294382e34f5cf2b84b3e28c8445138a6e|commit 029ca9f}} made it so that wishing for a "Scorpius egg" would instead yield a normal scorpion egg as opposed to forbidding it outright.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|3900|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Scorpius}}
Scorpius (♏︎), or Scorpio, is one of the constellations of the zodiac, located in the Southern celestial hemisphere near the center of the Milky Way. It sits between Libra to the west and Sagittarius to the east, and is an ancient constellation that long pre-dates its identification by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century.

In Greek mythology, several tales associated with the constellation are also related to Orion. According to one version, Orion boasted to the goddess Artemis and her mother Leto that he would kill every animal on Earth, and the duo sent a scorpion to kill Orion; their battle caught the attention of Zeus, who raised both combatants to the sky to serve as a reminder for mortals to curb their excessive pride. In another version, Artemis' twin brother Apollo sent the scorpion to kill Orion after the hunter earned the goddess' favor by admitting she was better than him, after which Zeus raised Orion and the scorpion to the sky - the seasons for each constellation's appearance is explained as Orion resuming his hunts every winter, but fleeing every summer when the scorpion comes.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Since early times, the Scorpion has represented death, darkness,
and evil.  Scorpius is the reputed slayer of Orion the Hunter.
[...]  The gods put both scorpion and hunter among the stars, but
on opposite sides of the sky so they would never fight again.
As Scorpius rises in the east, Orion sets in the west.

The {{questmon|Master Assassin|Rogue|nemesis}}

== Strategy ==

Reaching him generally proves to be more difficult than fighting him, due to the design of the level. While the Master Assassin can be very annoying, if you're a competent fighter, he doesn't pose much of a threat to you. However, he has a nasty habit of teleporting into the lower left corner of his level (the area that is inaccessible to you while in the larger middle portion) and healing himself. There are a few good ways to take him out quickly and easily:

* Zap him with a [[wand of death]], if you have one, to get rid of him instantly.
* Throw a [[potion of sickness]] at him and he'll soon be gone.
* Throw a potion of {{of|potion|sleeping|or=1|paralysis}} at him, then beat his head in. You may wish to wield the potion if you want to be sure it will hit. Zapping him with a [[wand of sleep]] can also achieve the same ends.

Alternatively, after he lands on the upstairs, leave the level via whatever means you have prepared and re-enter. This will remove the whole "hard to reach" part of the conflict and reduce it to a basic boss fight.

Instead of reaching him directly, you can also use a [[drum of earthquake]], a cursed [[potion of invisibility]], the shriek of a [[shrieker]], or the psychic blast of a [[mind flayer]] to wake him up while you're standing on the upstair. This will cause him to warp to you and attack, while preventing him from escaping to the floor above.

}}

{{questmon|Ashikaga Takauji|Samurai|nemesis}} He guards the [[Bell of Opening]] and the Samurai's [[quest artifact]], [[the Tsurugi of Muramasa]].

In line with the flavor text produced from his defeat (as seen on the [[Samurai quest]] article), he [[Corpseless|will never leave a corpse]].

==Strategy==
Like all humans, Ashikaga Takauji ignores [[Elbereth]]. He has unimpressive base damage with two weapon attacks and an artifact-theft attack, but he will usually be wielding your quest artifact, which can potentially [[The_Tsurugi_of_Muramasa#Effects|bisect]] you. This makes him one of the most dangerous quest nemeses to face in melee range, and there is no shame in considering leaving Takauji alone unless you have options to actually deal with him.

More cautious players may wait until they have a more thoroughly assembled kit with a fallback measure, usually an [[amulet of life saving]]. The [[Samurai (player monster)|samurai player monsters]] and [[ninja]] on the quest often carry useful [[attack wand]]s, however, and it is very easy to approach the quest nemesis without disturbing him from his meditation, due to the layout of the level. The final entrance before the inner section gives you a clear shot with any [[ranged weapon]] from far enough away that he will not immediately wake up.

Ashikaga Takauji has no elemental immunities or extrinsic magic resistance, so a [[wand of death]] can kill him immediately. A [[wand of sleep]] may also work, but carries the risk of him resisting the ray and waking up to swing the Tsurugi at you. 

Players without a wand of death may want to awaken him from the upstairs using a cursed [[potion of invisibility]] from the safety of a [[boulder fort]], then kill him with ranged attacks.

You can also do a [[Polymorph control|controlled]] [[polymorph]] into any [[large|large-sized]] or bigger monster to avoid bisection. The [[black dragon]] is the most ideal form, since using [[disintegration]] breath via the [[Monster (command)|#monster]] command will easily kill Ashikaga Takauji without destroying the Tsurugi or the Bell of Opening.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Ashikaga Takauji}}
Ashikaga Takauji is a historical figure of medieval Japan. He was Shogun from 1338 to 1358.
{{clear}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the [[disarm (technique)|disarm]] technique can get Ashikaga to drop the Tsurugi with fairly decent frequency, in case a melee fight is unavoidable. Attacking will then make him teleport to the stairs and heal, leaving the Tsurugi behind.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|Ashikaga Takauji was a daimyo of the Minamoto clan who
joined forces with the Go-Daigo to defeat the Hojo armies.
Later when Go-Daigo attempted to reduce the powers of the
samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.
Go-Daigo eventually escaped and established another
government in the town of Yoshino.  This period of dual
governments was known as the Nambokucho.
[ Samurai - The Story of a Warrior Tradition, by Cook ]
On July 8, 1336,  he and his samurai entered Kyoto, forced Go-Daigo
to retire,  after which  he seized  power himself  and installed  a
puppet prince on the throne  (the current Japanese  imperial family
are  the   descendants  of  this   puppet  emperor  that   Ashikaga
installed).

Go-Daigo escaped,  though, wouldn't  admit to  have been  defeated,
and  opened a new "capital"  in Yoshino (south of  Kyoto), where he
and few  of his  descendants claimed  to be  running a  government,
known as  the "Southern Court". The  period between  1337 and 1392,
when Japan was ruled by two courts, is known as the Nambokucho.
                               
That "government" disappeared, naturally, after a  few generations,
and Ashikaga's  Muromachi regime lasted for  a long  time. The last
Ashikaga daimyo in power was the 14th descendant of Takauji.

{{questmon|Lord Surtur|Valkyrie|nemesis}} He is a [[fire giant]] that guards the [[Bell of Opening]] and the Valkyrie's [[quest artifact]], [[The Orb of Fate]].

Like any other fire giant, eating Lord Surtur's [[corpse]] may grant fire resistance with a 50% chance (compare to 30% from any other fire giant), and also has a chance to raise the player's [[strength]]. 

==Strategy==
Since Surtur is generated [[meditating]] at the center of his lair, any Valkyrie can easily use their innate [[stealth]] to clear the area of [[fire ant]]s and his fellow fire giants. Lord Surtur can be defeated easily by a prepared Valkyrie; even so, he is likely one of the first [[covetous]] enemies a Valkyrie will meet, and novice players must still handle him carefully. As a monster that is fire resistant but not cold resistant, he will take extra damage from cold attacks, such as a [[wand of cold]].

Like all other quest nemeses, you can also awaken him remotely and bring him to you. Lord Surtur respects [[Elbereth]] and the [[scroll of scare monster]], and can be killed instantly with a [[wand of death]]. A [[wand of polymorph]] or [[wand of sleep]] may also work to incapacitate him, but may take a few attempts due to his relatively high MR.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Lord Surtur, like all uniques, no longer respects either Elbereth or scrolls of scare monster.}}

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Surtr}}
Lord Surtur's depiction draws directly from Norse folklore - in ''The Prose Edda'', Surtr is depicted as an important giant of Ragnarök, the Norse mythos's end of the world. The mythological name is spelled "'''Surtr'''" in Old Norse, and "Surtur" in modern-day Icelandic.

{{todo|Update stats, possibly strategy for 3.7.0 - quest leaders have been toughened since killing them no longer makes the game (completely) [[unwinnable]].}}

==Origin==
Like many aspects of the barbarian role, Pelias is inspired by the [[wikipedia:Conan the Barbarian|''Conan'' mythos]]; a character named Pelias appears in ''[[wikipedia:The Scarlet Citadel|The Scarlet Citadel]]'' as one of the rare sorcerers to ally with Conan.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Conan cried out sharply and recoiled, thrusting his companion
back.  Before them rose the great shimmering white form of Satha,
an ageless hate in its eyes.  Conan tensed himself for one mad
berserker onslaught -- to thrust the glowing faggot into that
fiendish countenance and throw his life into the ripping sword-
stroke.  But the snake was not looking at him.  It was glaring
over his shoulder at the man called Pelias, who stood with his
arms folded, smiling.  And in the great, cold, yellow eyes
slowly the hate died out in a glitter of pure fear -- the only
time Conan ever saw such an expression in a reptile's eyes.
With a swirling rush like the sweep of a strong wind, the great
snake was gone.
"What did he see to frighten him?" asked Conan, eyeing his
companion uneasily.
"The scaled people see what escapes the mortal eye," answered
Pelias cryptically.  "You see my fleshy guise, he saw my naked
soul."

Greek physician, recognized as the father of medicine. He is believed to have been born on the island of Cos, to have studied under his father, a physician, to have traveled for some time, perhaps studying in Athens, and to have then returned to practice, teach, and write at Cos.  The Hippocratic or Coan school that formed around him was of enormous importance in separating medicine from superstition and philosophic speculation, placing it on a strictly scientific plane based on objective observation and critical deductive reasoning.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|King Arthur has been toughened, like other quest leaders, since killing them no longer makes the game [[unwinnable]].  See {{commit|20cbadcf85544cf9d0c3f4e4200b2800bab49c8e|this commit}}.

King Arthur now has 15 speed (instead of 12); 90 MR (instead of 40); and two 4d10 weapon attacks (instead of two 1d6 weapon attacks).  In addition, he now receives a blessed +4 long sword (named [[Excalibur]] if it does not already exist), and a +4 [[plate mail]].
}}

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|King Arthur}}
King Arthur is the heroic legendary king of Britain, and the original wielder of the sword [[Excalibur]]. His legend probably originates from a real historical figure of Roman Britain. From that forgotten historical figure, the mythology was gradually fleshed out over centuries.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Ector took both his sons to the church before which the
anvil had been placed.  There, standing before the anvil, he
commanded Kay:  "Put the sword back into the steel if you
really think the throne is yours!"  But the sword glanced
off the steel.  "Now it is your turn", Ector said facing
Arthur.
The young man lifted the sword and thrust with both arms; the
blade whizzed through the air with a flash and drilled the
metal as if it were mere butter.  Ector and Kay dropped to
their knees before Arthur.
"Why, father and brother, do you bow before me?", Arthur asked
with wonder in his voice.
"Because now I know for sure that you are the king, not only
by birth but also by law", Ector said.  "You are no son of
mine nor are you Kay's brother.  Immediately after your birth,
Merlin the Wise brought you to me to be raised safely.  And
though it was me that named you Arthur when you were baptized,
you are really the son of brave king Uther Pendragon and queen
Igraine..."
And after these words, the lord rose and went to see the arch-
bishop to impart to him what had passed.

In a reference to his myth, Orion can [[swim]]. This is not likely to be noticed in an ordinary game, however, as there is no [[water]] on the home level of the [[Ranger quest]].

{{todo|Update stats, possibly strategy for 3.7.0 - quest leaders have been toughened since killing them no longer makes the game (completely) [[unwinnable]].}}

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Orion (mythology)}}
In classical mythology, Orion was a mighty hunter and child of Poseidon.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and
a mighty hunter. His father gave him the power of wading
through the depths of the sea, or, as others say, of
walking on its surface.

He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he
was a favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry
him. Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her,
but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many
tears, Diana placed him among the stars, where he appears
as a giant, with a girdle, sword, lion's skin, and 
club. Sirius, his dog, follows him, and the Pleiads fly
before him.

The {{questmon|Master of Thieves|Rogue|leader}} He is also the [[Tourist]] [[quest nemesis]].

Interestingly, since he pulls double duty as quest nemesis and quest leader, he resists [[stoning]] and can also steal [[the Master Key of Thievery]] (or any other [[covetous|covetable]] artifact) from a [[Rogue]], though this will not occur in a normal game.<ref>The only way to even set up such a scenario would be to kill him in one hit (e.g. with a [[wand of death]]), thus preventing him from immediately expelling you from the quest branch. If he then leaves a corpse, you can remove it and revive it if you really want to see him steal the Key.</ref>

==Strategy==
{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The Master of Thieves, along with other quest leaders, has been made significantly stronger, since killing quest leaders no longer makes the game [[unwinnable]].  This also means that he is stronger as the Tourist quest nemesis.  See {{commit|20cbadcf85544cf9d0c3f4e4200b2800bab49c8e|this commit}}.

The changed stats are as follows:
Speed becomes 15 (from 12); MR becomes 90 (from 30); first attack becomes 4d10 (from 2d6).

The Master of Thieves also starts with a +5 [[leather armor]], a +4 [[silver dagger]], and 2d4 non-cursed +2 [[daggers]] when generated as the Rogue quest leader.
}}

As the quest nemesis of Tourists, the Master of Thieves is little trouble at all for a player who is strong enough to fight through the crowds of [[soldier]]s that defend his lair. The most important thing to note is that he will pick up [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]] as soon as the player disturbs him, and will therefore have [[magic resistance]]&mdash;death rays and so forth will not hurt him.

This is scarcely a problem, as he is relatively unimpressive in melee and lacks special attacks, beyond being able to steal the PYEC back from you if you get it before killing him. He also lacks any other resistances - if you have any darts (e.g. your starting stack of +2 [[darts]]) or other [[projectile]]s on hand, you should [[poison]] them with a [[potion of sickness]]; a flurry of poisoned projectiles fired with a sufficient skill level will drop him quickly and possibly even instakill him.

There was a flutter of wings at the window.  Ymor shifted his bulk out of the chair and crossed the room, coming back with a large raven.  After he'd unfastened the message capsule from its leg it flew up to join its fellows lurking among the rafters.  Withel regarded it without love.  Ymor's ravens were notoriously loyal to their master, to the extent that Withel's one attempt to promote himself to the rank of greatest thief in Ankh-Morpork had cost their master's right hand man his left eye.  But not his life, however.  Ymor never grudged a man his ambitions.

They cast lots over the cradle of every child that was born,
and placed gifts in the cradle.  Their names were Urda,
Verdandi, and Skuld, representing the past, the present, and
the future.  Urda and Verdandi were kindly disposed, but Skuld
was cruel and savage.  Their tasks were to sew the web of
fate, to water the sacred ash, Yggdrasil, and to keep it in
good condition by placing fresh earth around it daily.  In her
fury, Skuld often spoiled the work of her sisters by tearing

{{todo|Update stats, possibly strategy for 3.7.0 - quest leaders have been toughened since killing them no longer makes the game (completely) [[unwinnable]].}}
==History==
Neferet the Green replaced the [[Wizard of Balance]] as Wizard Quest Leader in [[NetHack 3.4.0]], perhaps because Wizards, who were always neutral up to and including [[NetHack 3.2.3]], can now be neutral or chaotic. Your quest leader's alignment is adjusted to match your starting alignment, and it doesn't make sense for a Wizard of Balance to be chaotic.

==Origin==
Neferet the Green may be a reference to Nefertiti, an Egyptian queen of the 18th dynasty, or to Nofret (also sometimes called Neferet or Nefert), an Egyptian princess from the 4th dynasty; 'Nfr-t' is a transliteration of the hieroglyphs meaning "beautiful woman". Given that the Wizard role uses a [[Pantheon]] of Egyptian gods, a reference to Ancient Egypt seems likely.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Neferet the Green holds office in her hidden tower, only reachable by magical means, where she teaches her apprentices the enigmatic skills of occultism.  Despite her many years, she continues to investigate new spells, especially those involving translocation.  It is further rumored that when she was an apprentice herself, she accidentally turned her skin green, and has kept it that way ever since.

'''Aligned priests''' and '''aligned priestesses''', {{monsym|aligned_priest}}, tend the [[temple]]s of [[NetHack]]. They always appear as "priest[ess] of ([[deity]])".

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Aligned priests are now referred to as "aligned clerics".}}

==Generation==
Priests tending to temples are always generated [[peaceful]]. Several hostile priests may appear in the locate level of the [[Priest]]'s [[quest]], and several assorted hostile priests are also generated on the [[Astral Plane]]; co-aligned hostile priests generated this way are described as "renegade".

Aligned priests cannot be fully revived in any way: using one of the [[revive|revival]] methods on an aligned priest corpse or [[stone-to-flesh]]ing a statue merely produces a [[human zombie]].{{refsrc|src/read.c|2418|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Interestingly, aligned priests can [[grow up]] into [[high priest]]s.{{refsrc|src/mondata.c|1008|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

===Occurrence of temples with priests===
{{main|Temple}}
Every [[Minetown]] variant (with the exception of Orc Town) has a temple of a random alignment, and the [[Valley of the Dead]] has a temple of [[Moloch]]; both levels are eligible for [[bones]], so it is possible for either priest to be dead or else wandering about the level if their temple has been desecrated. Beware in these instances, since #[[chat]]ting to a wandering priest will make them hostile, as discussed below.

There are also guaranteed temples with accompanying priests on locate level of the [[Knight quest]] (neutral), the locate level of the [[Priest quest]] (unaligned), and the home level of the [[Caveman quest]] (co-aligned). The [[high priest]] of Moloch is always found guarding [[the Amulet of Yendor]] in [[Moloch's Sanctum]], and is also generated peaceful, though they will become hostile once you enter their room.

===Inventory===
Aligned priests are [[Monster starting inventory|generated with]] a [[mace]], [[small shield]], 20&ndash;29 [[zorkmid]]s, and one of the following cloaks: a [[robe]] (6/7 chance), [[cloak of protection]] (2/21 chance), or [[cloak of magic resistance]] (1/21 chance). Those generated within a temple additionally receive 2&ndash;4 [[spellbook]]s.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|689|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Chatting to a priest==
If you #[[chat]] to a temple's priest, a variety of effects can result. If you have no gold in open inventory and are co-aligned, the priest will "give you two bits for an ale" (two [[zorkmid]]s) if they have any gold (or one bit if they only have that); they will "preach the virtues of poverty" if they have no gold. If you are cross-aligned, they will ignore you.

If you are carrying gold in open inventory, the priest will prompt you for a contribution to the temple; depending on the amount of gold you offer, one of several events will happen:{{reffunc|priest.c|priest_talk}}
{|style="border:none; margin:0; padding:0; width: 44em;" class="prettytable"
!Offer
!Effect
|-
|0 or less
|If the priest is [[co-aligned]], you lose one [[alignment record|alignment point]].

''"Thou shalt regret thine action!"''
|-
|Positive but less than 200 times current [[experience level]]
|If this is less than one third of your visible gold (before donation), nothing happens.

''"Cheapskate."''

Otherwise, exercises [[wisdom]].

''"I thank thee for thy contribution."''
|-
|At least 200 but less than 400 times current [[experience level]]
|''"Thou art indeed a pious individual."''

If this is more than one third of your visible gold, you are granted 500&ndash;999 (more) turns of [[clairvoyance]]. If additionally the priest is coaligned and you have sinned or worse, you gain one point of alignment.

''"I bestow upon thee a blessing."''
|-
|At least 400 but less than 600 times current [[experience level]]
|
If you have never bought [[intrinsic protection]], earn 2&ndash;4 points of protection. Otherwise if you have less than 9 protection, or less than 20 with a 1-in-current-protection chance, earn an additional point of protection; if not, fall through to next case. Note that these limits make no distinction between protection bought and protection granted as a [[prayer|favor]]. (This is the preferred way to obtain protection.) <!--Repeat this because newbies keep asking it-->For clarity: you can buy protection at any temple with a peaceful priest, be it to your god, a rival god, or to Moloch, but not at a desecrated temple. (See [[Protection racket]])

''"Thy devotion has been rewarded."''
|-
|At least 600 times current [[experience level]]
|''"Thy selfless generosity is deeply appreciated."''

If this is more than one third of your visible gold and the temple is co-aligned:
* If you have not performed this action in the last 5000 turns, and your alignment is less than 0, it is reset to 0.
* Otherwise, you gain 2 alignment points.
|}

However, in the following cases the effects described above will not happen:

*If a priest is hostile, it is useless to chat to them.

*If a priest is not in their temple or the temple has been desecrated, #chatting to the priest makes them hostile. This usually applies only to priests in bones files and the peaceful co-aligned priests on the Astral Plane, as the priest will already be hostile if you have desecrated the temple yourself; the message you get when entering the temple indicates the state of affairs. Even if you reconvert the temple's [[altar]] to the priest's religion and pacify them, they still get angry on chatting.

*If the priest is sleeping or cannot move, #chatting to the priest wakes them up from sleep or paralysis and again makes them hostile.

*Chatting to a scared priest (e.g. you are standing on scroll of scare monster) also make them hostile. Note that a scroll of scare monster cannot save you from their attack.

==Strategy==
Despite being relatively lacking in armor, priests are deceptively powerful, with a weapon attack that can deal upwards of 40 base damage and an arsenal of highly dangerous [[Monster spell#Clerical spells|clerical spells]] - this includes the ability to [[confuse]], [[blind]] or even [[paralyze]] an unfortunate player, as well as [[Summon insects|swarming them with insects]]. Accidentally angering a peaceful priest may potentially be a game-ending mistake. Furthermore, since aligned priests cannot be "properly" revived, be sure to keep any strong pets away and not activate [[conflict]] anywhere near the priest if you want to obtain their services.

As the earliest a hostile priest can possibly generate is the locate level of the [[Priest quest]], the player should ideally have at least one means to address some of the status spells (e.g. a [[unicorn horn]]) by then, as well as [[poison resistance]] to avoid dying at the hands of [[Team Ant]] and the other {{mcsl|a}} they create. A [[ring of free action]] is one of the best options to have, as even an otherwise-capable player character can be decimated if the priest paralyzes them at a bad time.

One of the quickest ways to deal with a hostile priest is to [[petrify]] them with a [[wield]]ed [[cockatrice]] corpse. A decently powerful pet can also aid in killing the priest, but can just as easily be killed by a powerful swing from their mace unless the pet has solid AC.

===Killing a temple priest safely===
For those looking to convert a temple's altar, in addition to the above information, there are a few major obstacles:

#Directly attacking a peaceful priest is a [[Bad Idea]], as their god will strike you with lightning (which can be deflected if you have [[reflection]]).
#Attempting to convert the temple's altar will anger the priest.
#Killing a peaceful priest carries the standard [[Luck]] and alignment penalty for [[murder]]. (You do not lose any protection you have gained unless the priest was coaligned, in which case the altar should be coaligned as well and you would have no reason to kill the priest anyways.)

A good way to convert a temple is to use a [[scroll of earth]] (which can be obtained from [[Sokoban]]); you will also need a form of reflection (which ''can'' also be found in Sokoban). Stand in the temple so that the priest is not adjacent to you, then read the scroll; optionally, push the boulders to confine the priest to one particular square. Then, drop a [[scroll of scare monster]] on your fighting spot to protect you from any summoned ants.

Now you can [[blind]] yourself and [[zap]] or [[Firing|fire]] things at the priest without the risk of being paralyzed or getting hit with the mace; be sure to have [[telepathy]] so you can aim properly, and remember to have reflection for the god's lightning strikes! If you lack reflection and/or [[shock resistance]], but have a [[ray]] attack, you might want to bounce them off the temple's walls towards the priest from outside instead - keeping the walls between you and the altar will help avoid the lightning.{{reffunc|priest.c|ghod_hitsu}} Once the priest is killed, you can start sacrificing. If you are playing a [[chaotic]] human, you should try to #[[offer]] the priest's corpse, since it will have a 100% chance of converting the altar.

If you wish to kill a temple's priest yourself and avoid the penalty for [[murder]], polymorphing the priest into a non-human is an option, although it is quite risky - their god will still strike you with lightning, and their decent [[Magic resistance (monster)|monster magic resistance]] may foul the attempt and simply leave you with an angry priest.

Still another way is to poison the priest with a [[scroll of stinking cloud]] - the rub is that you need to be able to see the center spot you are targeting the cloud on, but you will also want shelter from the god's lightning, which may originate from positions other than the altar.{{reffunc|priest.c|ghod_hitsu}}

===Trapping an aligned priest with boulders===
In some temples, depending on the temple size and the location of the altar, you can trap a temple priest using a scroll of earth, so you can convert the altar safely without committing murder or dealing with lightning strikes<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/bb2908af1355815f/6b171b7823ef7245?lnk=gst&q=priest#6b171b7823ef7245 RGRN Priest trapping thread]</ref>. The priest needs to see you, so wear a [[mummy wrapping]] if you are invisible. Beware that a dwarf or other digging monster may free the priest, though the priest will usually stay inside the temple area including the diggable walls.

Once you have converted the altar, you can read a [[Confusion|confused]] [[scroll of taming]] for a chance of [[pacify]]ing the priest (still behind the boulders) after converting the altar, or you can cast {{spell of|sleep}} at them to make it safe to approach and [[spellbook of charm monster|charm]] them. Remember that you cannot buy protection from that priest afterward, as chatting with them will merely anger them.

To understand why these step-by-step instructions work, keep in mind a priest that is still tending an altar moves according to two rules:
# When the priest wants to move, he will pick a random adjacent spot on a 3×3 grid centered on the altar.
# But, he will not move into your [[line of fire]] unless he is already in it.
You take advantage of the second rule to try to steer the priest around.
