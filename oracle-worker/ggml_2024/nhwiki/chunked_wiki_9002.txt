&&%s&& %s Spellbook of flame sphere {131922 2020-02-07T15:34:31Z {4001191 Vivit} /* Techniques */ {{spellbook|name=flame sphere|level=1|type=matter|turns=2}}

The '''spellbook of flame sphere''' is a [[deferred feature]]. It creates a [[tame]] [[flaming sphere]] which explodes at an enemy. It is implemented in [[SLASH'EM]].

==SLASH'EM==

In SLASH'EM, the spellbook of flame sphere is part of the starting equipment of the [[flame mage]] class.  It is the staple attack spell for the flame mage in the early game, since the more powerful [[fireball]] begins out of reach.  The flame mage starts with [[matter]] skill at [[basic]] level. As this skill improves, the number of flaming spheres summoned will increase to two at [[skilled]] and three at [[expert]], all for the same casting cost.

===General Strategy===
Since the flame sphere does not attack a monster directionally in the way that [[force bolt]] or [[magic missile]] does, the flame mage must learn to manipulate the flame sphere's position to defend against enemies. Using pet displacement is an important aspect; you will learn to dance through your spheres to get them into range of enemies. The flame mage should generally keep a flame sphere floating around in the early game just in case.  In the likely event that your spheres sometimes get left behind, they may go feral and revert to peacefully bobbing around in empty rooms.  Flame spheres do not appear able to turn hostile.

On the other hand, flame spheres left to their own devices can cause a lot of problems.  Since they are summoned monsters rather than pets, responsibility for their kills accrues to the player.  This means not only that you will get the experience for the kills, but also the blame: [[shopkeeper]]s, [[guard]]s, [[peaceful]] monsters, and [[god]]s will direct their anger at you if your spheres blow up in the wrong direction.  The flame mage thus needs to keep an eye on where his or her spheres go and make a point of using them only in safe contexts.  It is usually unwise to attack [[mimic]]s in [[shop]]s with sphere attacks: they may miss their mark.  The flame mage should use closed doors to control where spheres can travel and try to "burn off" excess spheres after a major battle before exploring the dungeon too far.  (The fungi that crop up on a batch of corpses in SLASH'EM may be useful for this purpose.)

Finally, the flame mage must use caution while [[blind]], since flame spheres will not show up through [[telepathy]] and killing one by accident has the same [[anger]] effects as killing a pet.

===Techniques===
A flame sphere is the perfect weapon for jumping the distance between you and a [[cross-aligned]] [[unicorn]]. Two or three should do the trick.

Find a magic whistle early to keep your spheres close.

Keep in mind monsters' different vulnerabilities: flame spheres will not affect high-level [[demon]]s, nor, of course, fire [[elemental]]s, [[fire vortex|fire vortices]], etc.

Flame spheres have the dramatic ability to take down shopkeepers without giving them the chance to leave their shop and attack.  Simply stand diagonally next to an open shop door (not in front of it, unless you want to get shot) and keep summoning, using a combination of [[power surge]] and [[draw energy]] [[technique]]s as necessary. (You may need a [[pick-axe]] to carve out a suitable nook for yourself.) The shopkeeper will continue to switch weapons and patrol his or her shop interior, not sure if you are inside or outside.  Eventually, you will stop hearing the explosions of your spheres (or you will level up).  The shop is yours!  (Note that this should almost certainly be considered [[degenerate behavior]].)

The '''spellbook of freeze sphere''' is a [[deferred feature]]. It creates a [[tame]] [[freezing sphere]] which explodes at an enemy. It is included in [[SLASH'EM]].

==SLASH'EM==
In SLASH'EM, the spellbook of freeze sphere is part of the starting equipment of the [[ice mage]] class.  It is the staple attack spell for the ice mage in the early game, since the more powerful [[cone of cold]] begins out of reach.  The ice mage starts with [[matter]] skill at [[basic]] level. As this skill improves, the number of freezing spheres summoned will increase to two at [[skilled]] and three at [[expert]], all for the same casting cost.

===General strategy===

Using pet displacement is an important aspect; you will learn to dance through your spheres to get them into range of enemies. The ice mage should generally keep a freezing sphere floating around in the early game just in case.  In the likely event that your spheres sometimes get left behind, they may go feral and revert to peacefully bobbing around in empty rooms.  Tame freezing spheres do not appear able to turn hostile.

On the other hand, freezing spheres left to their own devices can cause a lot of problems.  Since they are summoned monsters rather than pets, responsibility for their kills accrues to the player.

This is something of an exploit, as the willingness of shopkeepers to sit in their shops and be repeatedly hit by spheres is likely unintentional.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of haste self {143130 2021-10-06T18:21:21Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{spellbook|name=haste self|level=3|type=escape|turns=8|direction=non-directional|equiv=[[potion of speed]]|abundance=3.36%|role=barbarian}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of haste self''' you to learn the '''spell of haste self'''. It is a level 3 [[escape spell]], and the [[spellbook]] takes 10 actions to read. It is the [[special spell]] for [[Barbarian]]s.

==Generation==
Roughly 3.36% of randomly-generated spellbooks will be a spellbook of haste self.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell gives you very fast [[speed]] temporarily, and can be cast cumulatively to increase the number of turns the effect lasts for. At [[Unskilled]] or [[Basic]], the haste effect lasts for 100–109 (more) turns - at Skilled or Expert, it lasts for 160–169 (more) turns.

Unlike a potion of speed, it will not heal [[wounded legs]], but still exercises [[dexterity]] when cast.

==Strategy==
While most NetHack players achieve very fast speed by wearing [[speed boots]], if you need both very fast speed and [[jump]]ing (e.g., on the [[Astral Plane]]), you can combine this spell with a pair of [[jumping boots]]. A [[potion of speed]] can be just as effective for the short duration required and requires no casting aptitude, but the spell only requires knowledge of it and the ability to cast it reliably.

A [[Wizard]] with [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]] can stand in place for a while and cast haste self dozens of times, obtaining enough turns of speed to last the rest of the game - this allows them to free up an armor slot for a different pair of boots, e.g. [[water walking boots]], and the process can be easily repeated by the time it wears off.

Despite being their special spell, haste self is difficult for most Barbarians to use due to their [[spellcasting]] penalty - while the spell is possible to cast with sufficient skill and a [[robe]], they may instead opt to combine speed boots with {{spell of|jumping}}, which is easier to cast.

==History==
The spellbook of haste self and its spell first appear in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

In [[NetHack 3.6.2]], all roles were given the ability to advance to at least Basic in their special spell's school, making it more plausible for Barbarians to cast haste self.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the spell of haste self is moved to the [[body spells]] school.

There is a well-hidden chest in the northwestern corner of [[Grund's Stronghold]] that can contain a spellbook of haste self - the book is always accompanied by an [[amulet of magical breathing]].

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], the spellbook of haste self is replaced with the [[spellbook of speed monster]].

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of healing {137376 2021-01-21T00:34:35Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{spellbook|name=healing|level=1|type=healing|turns=2|direction=beam|equiv=[[potion of healing]]|abundance=4.07%}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', reading a '''spellbook of healing''' allows you to learn the '''spell of healing'''. This is an [[emergency spell]].

==Generation==
Healers start with a [[blessed]] spellbook of healing. [[Monk]]s have a 1 in 3 chance of starting with this spellbook as well.

==Effects==
Healing is a [[directional spell]] that heals its target(s) for 6d4 HP and, at Skilled or higher, cures [[blindness]].{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2471|nethack=3.6.2}} This will awaken a sleeping monster without angering it. The effect is similar to an uncursed [[potion of healing]], except that the spell cannot increase maximum HP.

Casting this spell at a [[tame]] or [[peaceful]] monster will yield an [[alignment record|alignment]] bonus for each monster affected, even if it was already at maximum HP; [[Lawful]]s and [[Healer]]s gain one alignment point, while [[chaotic]]s besides Healers lose one point.

[[Pestilence]] will actually take 3d4 damage from the spell of healing, with the damage halved due to his guaranteed [[monster magic resistance]].

==Strategy==
Healing is the easiest spell in the [[healing spell]] school, and is thus a good spell to train that skill with. It is also a useful utility spell in general, especially for non-spellcaster classes who will probably not be using their power pool for anything else - being able to heal oneself is universally beneficial. Once you learn {{spell of|extra healing}}, however, this spell is useful only when aiming to conserving power.

Although casting this spell at yourself is the most common use, remember that it is directional; using it to heal a pet(s) is a viable strategy, especially in the early-game or for [[pacifist]] players.

This spell is most useful when it would be impractical or dangerous to wait for HP to recover, such as on deeper [[dungeon level]]s, or when [[self polymorph|polymorphed]] into a monster (which significantly reduces your natural regeneration).

==Messages==
{{message|<Monster> looks better.}}

==History==
Before [[3.6.2]], this spell only cured blindness when cast at a monster at any skill level. 3.6.2 fixes this and also fixes a bug that prevented both this spell and the spell of extra healing from correctly healing untimed monster blindness.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of invisibility {145216 2022-03-28T07:12:32Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{spellbook|name=invisibility|level=4|type=escape|turns=15|direction=non-directional|equiv=[[potion of invisibility]]|abundance=2.54%|role=ranger}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of invisibility''' allows you to learn the '''spell of invisibility'''. It is the [[special spell]] for [[Ranger]]s, and the [[spellbook]] takes roughly 15 turns to read.

==Generation==
There is a ~2.54% chance that a randomly generated spellbook is a spellbook of invisibility.

There is a guaranteed spellbook of invisibility generated in a [[chest]] on the middle level of [[Vlad's Tower]].{{refsrc|dat/tower.des|96|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Effects==
Casting this spell at any [[skill]] level causes you to turn [[invisible]] for 31 to 45 (more) turns. 

==Strategy==
This spell might be useful if you only want temporary invisibility so you can still enter [[shop]]s later on. However, there are other sources of both temporary and permanent invisibility (e.g. via [[wand of make invisible|wand]], [[ring of invisibility|ring]], [[cloak of invisibility|cloak]], or [[potion of invisibility|potion]]) that are more convenient; at worst, if you are permanently invisible in a way that cannot be undone, you can still enter shops using a [[mummy wrapping]] or [[teleportation]]. Such permanent invisibility is often easier to obtain than the spell itself, and Rangers in particular are very unlikely to be able to make use of this spell before they find a mummy wrapping.

One niche use for this spell is to cast it before eating a [[stalker]] corpse to make the invisibility permanent and gain the [[see invisible]] intrinsic - but even then, other methods for this niche are more available in comparison to the spell, to say nothing of having a ring or cloak that can ideally be worn and removed at will.

==Variants==
Some variants focus on making the spell of invisibility more viable.
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the spell of invisibility is moved to the newly-added list of [[body spells]] (where it is still a fourth-level spell).

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Windowless Tower|Windowless Tower]] has a spellbook of invisibility in the same place as [[Vlad the Impaler]]'s original dwelling. Invisibility is also one of the spells that can take advantage of [[spell maintenance]].

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], the spellbook of invisibility is no longer randomly generated, but can still be written or wished for; it is now a level 1 escape spell, making it far easier to write and cast. Permanent invisibility is also no longer available as an intrinsic, though extrinsic sources are unchanged.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], invisibility is also a spell that can be maintained and kept in effect.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the spell of invisibility is reduced to a level 3 escape spell, making it more feasible for Rangers and some other roles to utilize; this also makes the spellbook an eligible candidate for generation as part of a [[Wizard]]'s starting inventory.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of jumping {130497 2020-01-11T23:31:18Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Strategy */ {{spellbook|name=jumping|level=1|type=escape|turns=3|abundance=2.03%}}
In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''[[spellbook]] of jumping''' allows you to learn the '''[[jumping]] spell'''.

==Effects==
{{main|Jumping}}

Casting allows you to jump to other tiles within a certain range, allowing you to pass over unavoidable traps and escape too-tough monsters. You must be able to see the landing spot, meaning that you cannot jump while blind, and you cannot jump ''over'' monsters; you will bump into them instead, angering them if they were peaceful. See the main article and its [[Jumping#Path|path section]] for more detailed information on jumping and whether a given jump will bring you in contact with a monster. Casting ''jump'' consumes d25 nutrition, in addition to the ordinary hunger penalty.

Advancing skill in [[escape spells]] allows you to jump farther, as is shown:

{|
| {{caption|Unskilled|{{jumpradius|skill=1}}}}
| {{caption|Basic|{{jumpradius|skill=2}}}}
| {{caption|Skilled|{{jumpradius|skill=3}}}}
| {{caption|Expert|{{jumpradius|skill=4}}}}
|}

==Strategy==

{{main|Jumping#Strategy}}

Jumping is a level 1 [[escape spell]], and thus the best choice for enhancing that spell branch. (Do not practice jumping in [[Sokoban]], though!) There are very few places where an unpleasant trap will be placed in an unavoidable position (although the back entrance of the [[Castle]] is a notable one), but for those situations it is generally useful; note that some types of trap, such as the [[fire trap]], cannot be bypassed by jumping. It finds some use in [[speed ascension]]s, where the small speed boost is critical; jumping actually goes faster than [[speed boots]], although the nutrition burn rate is too high to sustain it for long periods of time. Note that as jumping ends the turn rather than just costing one action, though, continuously jumping means you will see no benefit from speed.

In lit areas, or if carrying a light source, jumping makes for an excellent escape, whether on its own or combined with a [[wand of teleport]] for escaping from surrounding mobs of monsters. This is a particularly useful strategy on the [[Astral Plane]], where the nutrition cost is mostly irrelevant and there's no further area to preserve teleport charges for. This is most commonly done with [[jumping boots]], but the spell has slightly more range; it is probably not enough to make up for the Pw cost, though, leaving the boots as the superior source if you don't need the slot for [[speed boots]].

Jumping also helps cross certain special levels, notably [[Medusa's Island]]; although not a solution for crossing watery levels in general, it will allow you to get as far as the Castle, and possibly even enter it if you have a [[wand of striking]] or similar method of destroying the drawbridge. You can then wish for a [[ring of levitation]] or a similar permanent solution to traversing water. Make sure you have some method of detecting underwater creatures ([[warning]] works well) before trying this; being attacked by a [[giant eel]] or [[electric eel]] can end your game almost instantly, and colliding with an underwater creature while in midair (which is possible) can cause you to fall into the water, with all the usual negative effects.

As of [[NetHack 3.6.2]], [[Barbarians]] may be interested in learning the spell, since they can now advance skill in escape spells, allowing them to potentially apply the above strategies and/or train their [[special spell]], {{spell of|haste self}}.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of knock {144149 2022-01-15T14:58:23Z {4000865 Tomsod} /* Strategy */ turns out it can free you from pretty much anything {{spellbook|name=knock|level=1|type=matter|turns=1|direction=beam|equiv=[[wand of opening]]|abundance=3.56%}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of knock''' allows you to learn the '''spell of knock'''.

==Effects==
The effect is the exact same as a [[wand of opening]], and will unlock doors and [[container]]s, as well as revealing hidden doors.{{refsrc|spell.c|859}}

==Strategy==
Since a [[lock pick]] or [[skeleton key]] can unlock doors with no power cost, this spell is considered almost useless, and the spellbook is usually thrown away, [[polypile]]d, or [[magic marker|overwritten]]. However, it has many other uses besides the obvious: as a [[matter spell]], it can be used to train for casting more powerful spells in the school, notably {{spell of|polymorph}}. It can also expose secret doors whose locations are known to the player but not the character (especially on special levels), and can open the [[Castle]] [[drawbridge]] without needing an instrument to play the [[passtune]].

Casting knock also unlocks doors at a distance and does so slightly faster than a key would manage; because of this, it might be useful on the [[Astral Plane]], though a [[wand of digging]] is better because it will raze the doors. The spell also causes engulfing monsters to expel you, making it useful on the [[Plane of Air]]. It can also free you from most kinds of "holding traps"{{refsrc|src/zap.c|2744|nethack=3.6.1}}, including [[bear trap]]s, [[web]]s, [[pit]]s, buried [[punishment|iron ball]], or being [[lava|stuck in the floor]].{{refsrc|src/trap.c|4617|nethack=3.6.6}}  Technically it can also free you from being stuck in [[lava]], but usually you will immediately start sinking again (unless you're e.g. [[levitating]]).

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], there are new indestructible doors at the top level of [[Vlad's Tower]]. This spell has no effect on them, there is no message, and nothing happens.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of levitation {141272 2021-06-28T06:22:58Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{spellbook
|name=levitation
|level=4
|type=escape
|turns=12
|direction=non-directional
|equiv=[[potion of levitation]]
|abundance=2.03%
}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', reading the '''spellbook of levitation''' allows you to learn the '''spell of levitation'''. It is an [[escape spell]], and the [[spellbook]] takes 14 actions (roughly 12 turns) to read.

==Generation==
2.03% of all randomly-generated spellbooks will be a spellbook of levitation.

==Effects==
Casting the spell of levitation at Basic [[skill]] or lower in [[escape spells]] has the same effect as an uncursed [[potion of levitation]] - it grants you [[levitation]] for 10 to 149 (more) turns. Casting it at Skilled or higher has the same effect as a blessed potion, giving you 250 to 299 (more) turns of levitation as well as the ability to land at will using the {{kbd|>}} command.

Note that you must be at the appropriate skill-level at the time of ''casting''; if you cast it while Basic and then train to Skilled, you will ''not'' be able to land at will unless you cast it again.

==Strategy==
Early-game, the only real use for the spell is to levitate above an [[Elbereth]] engraving in order to slow down eroding it; this can be powerful, but if the Elbereth wears off as you cast the spell, you will be stuck in midair and unable to try again. Using the spell for this purpose is also potentially unwise due to the time it can leave you stuck in midair, which can exacerbate combat problems.

Later in the game, the spell is typically used to cross [[water]] or [[lava]]&mdash;you will get a warning that your levitation spell is about to wear off, so watch for that warning ''especially'' in such scenarios. While a levitation source is a vital part of most [[ascension kit]]s and handy for areas such as [[Medusa's Island]] and the much-later [[Plane of Air]]), it is typically wiser to use the [[ring of levitation]] and [[boots of levitation]] rather than the spell, as they work in a much more predictable way.

If you end up stuck in midair due to the use of this spell and do not want to wait it out, you can land using a [[sink]], a blessed potion of levitation, or (if somehow possible) raise the spell to Skilled and cast it again.

Uncontrolled levitation is unlikely to cause problems if cast in the Plane of Air, so long as you're mindful of the possibility of it wearing off - there is no real need to land on the ground from that point, unless you plan to drop the [[Amulet of Yendor]] to reduce Pw costs.

==History==
All spellbooks were introduced in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

The warning that your temporary levitation is close to expiring was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], the spell is a level 4 [[Spellcasting (SLASH'EM)|body spell]].

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of magic mapping {135698 2020-08-13T02:20:20Z {4000978 Aximili}  {{spellbook|name=magic mapping|level=5|type=divination|turns=35|direction=non-directional|equiv=[[scroll of magic mapping]]|abundance=1.83%|role=archaeologist}}
In ''[[NetHack]]'', a '''spellbook of magic mapping''' allows you to learn the '''spell of magic mapping'''. It is the [[special spell]] for [[archeologist]]s.

==Effects==
The spell reveals the entire map (although it does not fully reveal the contents of rooms), the same as an uncursed [[scroll of magic mapping]]; all of the level's walls and corridors, as well as all staircases on the level are shown. Secret passages are revealed, but secret doors are not.{{refsrc|read.c|1092}}

The spell will also reveal the current location of the [[magic portal]] on the [[Plane of Water]] if the player has formally located it before using confused [[gold detection]] or a [[crystal ball]].

==Strategy==
It is most popular for making it easier to traverse [[Gehennom]]'s vast mazes. Although useful on its own, it becomes even more useful when combined with any one of the following spells:
*{{spell of|Detect monsters}} allows players to head directly for, or avoid, certain enemies.
*{{spell of|Detect unseen}} reveals traps on the level, making traversing it even less dangerous.
*{{spell of|Detect treasure}} and {{spell of|Detect food}} add another layer of detail to the level overview.
*[[Teleportation]] and [[teleport control]] in tandem with this spell notably allows players to traverse whole levels in seconds (provided the floor allows it) by zipping to the exit stair almost instantaneously, or else quickly covering points of interest.

The spell is also useful on the ascension run to save time if the player has fallen past levels through [[hole]]s or [[trapdoor]]s.

==History==
The ability to reveal the portal on the Plane of Water was added in [[3.6.1]].

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of magic missile {147004 2022-07-26T17:44:19Z {4000227 Kufat} /* Origin */ {{spellbook|name=magic missile|level=2|type=attack|turns=2|direction=[[ray]]|equiv=[[wand of magic missile]]|abundance=4.58%|role=wizard}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', a '''[[spellbook]] of magic missile''' allows you to learn the '''spell of magic missile'''. It is the special spell for [[Wizard]]s.

== Effects ==

The magic missile ray does (([[XL|xplev]]/2)+1)d6 damage + [[Spellcasting#Damage|spell damage bonus]], so higher-level spellcasters can deal significant damage with this spell. A level 30 character deals 16d6 damage with magic missile, averaging 56 damage per hit. This spell's damage is doubled for [[Knight]]s by carrying [[the Magic Mirror of Merlin]].

== Strategy ==
If your character can only learn one attack spell, it should almost certainly be magic missile. Because the damage scales with experience level, magic missile remains viable and useful throughout the entire game. And because the spell is only level 2, almost any character with some spellcasting ability can cast it effectively; roles such as [[priest]], [[monk]], and [[wizard]] will find it especially useful as an all-purpose ranged attack, but others like [[archeologist|archeologists]], [[healer|healers]], and [[knight|knights]] may find it helpful as a backup as well, especially against monsters that might damage weapons (e.g., [[disenchanter|disenchanters]]) or when it's desirable to simultaneously damage a whole row of monsters. Advanced Wizards armed with [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]] can rely on magic missile as their primary attack.

For low-level Wizards, the {{spell of|force bolt}} spell they start with is usually a more efficient use of power than magic missile in the early game: force bolt costs 5 Pw and does 2d12 damage, while magic missile does slightly more damage starting at [[experience level]] 6 (doubled if hitting twice), but costs 10 Pw points. On the other hand, magic missile can still be useful in the early game in certain situations: it won't break fragile items and destroy boulders and doors, and it doesn't suffer from force bolt's fixed chance to hit, which can be an issue when encountering monsters with low [[AC]]. Wizards also get a bonus toward their success rate with magic missile since it is their [[special spell]], so early-game wizards may be able to wear metal [[armor]] and still get an acceptably low failure rate with magic missile.

As with most ray-based spells and wands, this spell can be used to kill enemies behind [[boulder]]s without breaking the boulder, making it invaluable in [[Sokoban]]. The ray can also be rebounded using walls to hit targets repeatedly.

==FIQHack==

In [[FIQHack]] magic missile does less damage at skill levels less than Expert (compared to vanilla).  At Skilled level magic missile can partially bypass [[reflection]].  At Expert level magic missile can partially bypass magic resistance (MR only halves damage).

==Origin==
The canonical [[D&D]] spell of ''[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicMissile.htm Magic Missile]'' was a stereotypically puny level one wizard spell that quickly became a staple of the wizard class, as it was effectively a homing attack with each bullet doing its own damage roll, which can easily rack up significant damage short of the target having magic resistance. In NetHack, the spell of magic missile retains this scaling ability and removes the cap of five missiles at level nine, though they can miss the target.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of remove curse {149825 2023-01-31T07:34:22Z {4001488 Tonttu3} /* Strategy */ casting multiple times advances skill even when actual uncursing doesn't happen {{spellbook|name=remove curse|level=3|type=clerical|turns=10|direction=non-directional|equiv=[[scroll of remove curse]]|abundance=2.54%|role=priest}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of remove curse''' allows you to learn the '''spell of remove curse'''. The book takes 12 actions to read; it is a [[clerical spell]], and the only [[emergency spell]] that is not a [[healing spell]]. Remove curse is the [[special spell]] for [[Priest]]s.

==Generation==
Priests have a chance of starting the game with a spellbook of remove curse as one of their two [[spellbooks]]. [[Wizard]]s may also start the game with the spellbook of remove curse as their second spellbook.

[[Aligned priest]]s may receive the spellbook of remove curse as one of their many spellbooks.

==Effects==
When cast at Basic level or lower, the spell of remove curse acts identically to an uncursed [[scroll of remove curse]]; at Skilled or higher, it is identical to a blessed scroll.

==Strategy==
The spell of remove curse is a very useful utility spell that makes use-testing certain items less dangerous - you can uncurse most items within your inventory by wielding them and casting the spell. If your role permits it, consider enhancing clerical spells from Basic to Skilled if you intend to uncurse multiple items in your inventory simultaneously and save magic power. If you want to advance the skill quickly, you can just cast the spell multiple times. It doesn't matter if the wielded object is cursed or not: as long as you get the message "You feel like someone is helping you.", the game considers your casting successful and trains the skill even if actual uncursing didn't happen because you weren't wielding a cursed item. The spell of remove curse spell is outclassed only by the [[spell of identify]], which can be cast beforehand to check items' BUC status as well as identifying them.

While the spell can uncurse weapons, doing so at Basic skill or lower requires that you have at least one hand free, so it is unwise to wield [[two-handed]] weapons for this purpose; one-handed weapons can be uncursed safely if you are not wearing a cursed shield in the other. Similarly, avoid putting on cursed armor that will significantly impair your ability to cast the spell, and beware of [[autocursing]] [[helm]]s. Wielding amulets to uncurse them is much safer than wear-testing - a discovered cursed [[amulet of strangulation]] will prevent you from chanting the spell and cannot be removed (except via [[prayer]]).{{refsrc|src/spell.c|648|nethack=3.6.1}} Also, the spell cannot be used to uncurse a [[saddle]] worn by a steed, regardless of if you are stuck on it at the time.

As Priests have an innate knowledge of an item's [[beatitude]], they can more readily spot cursed items - Priests thus excel at sorting through any [[bones]] files they encounter, as they can efficiently prioritize and uncurse loot using the spell to preserve precious [[holy water]]. The spell becomes especially useful during the mid- and late game for countering the [[curse items]] [[monster spell]] from enemy spellcasters (e.g., [[lich]]es, some [[quest nemeses]] and the [[Wizard of Yendor]]); scrolls of remove curse remain a useful backup item, and are best kept within a container to #[[tip]] out whenever you are prevented from casting.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Per [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/cf62687630184fa44e2993e26864033e88883784 this commit] and [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/blob/a70927b95f7940fd736bcf9a706c265339177ebd/doc/fixes37.0 the general list of fixes] for 3.7:

While [[riding]], the saddle is now considered part of your inventory, meaning that the spell of remove curse can now uncurse a cursed saddle.}}

==History==
Like all spellbooks, the spellbook of remove curse was introduced in [[NetHack 1.3d]]. The vocal requirement for [[spell casting]] (and thus being prevented from doing so by strangulation) was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], the spell of remove curse is now a level 5 [[Spellcasting (SLASH'EM)|protection spell]].

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of restore ability {137913 2021-02-16T03:01:02Z {4000681 Andrio Celos} Link to [[NetHack 3.7.0]] specifically. {{spellbook|name=restore ability|level=4|type=healing|turns=15|direction=non-directional|equiv=[[potion of restore ability]]|abundance=2.54%|role=monk}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of restore ability''' allows you to learn the '''spell of restore ability'''. It is considered an [[emergency spell]], and is the [[special spell]] for [[Monk]]s.

==Generation==
Monks receive this spellbook as their [[crowning]] gift in lieu of an artifact.

==Effect==
Casting this spell has the same effect as a [[potion of restore ability]], except that it does not restore lost levels. At less than skilled in healing spells, it restores one random lost attribute of [[strength]], [[dexterity]], [[constitution]], [[intelligence]], [[wisdom]], or [[charisma]] to its previous maximum amount, like an uncursed potion. At skilled or expert, it restores all six attributes like a blessed potion.

==Strategy==
Valuable as the spell's effects are, by the time the vast majority of characters even discover the spellbook - let alone become capable of casting it - they are likely to have ready access to [[unicorn horn]]s, which do a number of useful things in addition to restoring diminished ability scores. Monks receive the special spell bonus when casting this spell, and ''might'' just be in a position to require it before the first unicorn appears and is dispatched.

In [[SporkHack]], [[UnNetHack]] and [[xNetHack]] this spell is considerably more valuable since the unicorn horn no longer restores lost attributes. Once this spell is learned, you are safe to abuse your stats (e.g. by remaining satiated, consorting with foocubi), since any attributes lost can be easily restored. You will also accumulate potions of restore ability, which can now be used for dilution. Similarly, in [[Fourk]], unicorn horns lose one point of [[enchantment]], making horns a somewhat limited resource.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes in vanilla NetHack, so the value of this spell has increased as described above.}}

==History==
The spellbook was called the '''spellbook of restore strength''' at its introduction, along with spells themselves, in [[NetHack 1.3d]]. It was renamed to '''spellbook of restore ability''' in [[NetHack 3.0.0]], which also introduced the modern six-attribute system.

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of sleep''' allows you to learn the '''spell of sleep'''.

==Generation==
[[Monk]]s have a 1 in 3 chance of starting with this spellbook.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Sleep is now a level 3 spell, and Monks no longer have a chance of starting with it.}}

==Effects==
Casting it has the same effect as zapping a [[wand of sleep]]: monsters will be put to sleep for (level/2 + 1)d25 turns, where level is your experience level.<ref>{{function|mhitm.c|sleep_monst}}, {{sourcecode|zap.c|2486}}, {{sourcecode|objects.c|799}}</ref>

Monsters can resist this spell with [[monster magic resistance]], and it has no effect on already-sleeping or paralyzed monsters. Attacking monsters in melee has a 10% chance of waking them up. Bolts of sleep bounce from walls and unidentified secret doors, but are absorbed by known doors.

== Strategy ==
Sleep is a powerful offensive spell, and should be used as such. You can use it to help defeat or escape difficult monsters (unless the monster has high [[monster magic resistance]] or [[sleep resistance]]); just be careful where the beam bounces. You might want to check each turn with a [[stethoscope]] if you need to re-cast sleep instead of attacking. If you are resistant or have [[reflection]], try to bounce it off walls and hit monsters twice, in case the first zap misses or the monster resists.

If you want to kill a [[minotaur]] for their [[wand of digging]] or an [[aligned priest]] for his items, casting sleep is a wise first move even if you are polymorphed into a strong fighter form. You still want reflection in the event the temple's god smites you with lightning. Once you have sent an enemy to sleep, be cautious about attacking it in melee unless you can defeat it normally. In particular, if you have sent a [[floating eye]] or [[Medusa]] to sleep, never count on the sleep to keep you alive.

Although [[drum]]s and [[horn]]s are superb (and vastly underappreciated) [[scaring]] tools in crowd combat, they don't mix well with sleeping monsters.

You can use this spell to park a heavy monster on an [[altar]] so that you can kill it there without having it run away from you. The spell can also halt your pet before it stumbles into a trap, or attacks a creature you want alive, without decreasing [[tameness]] or otherwise counting as abuse.

A [[wizard]] or a hero with high [[Luck]] might reasonably want to write this spellbook if they find a [[magic marker]], retrying until they succeed.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of slow monster {143901 2021-12-17T23:35:34Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Messages */ {{spellbook|name=slow monster|level=2|type=enchantment|turns=2|direction=beam|equiv=[[wand of slow monster]]|abundance=3.05%}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of slow monster''' allows a player to learn the '''spell of slow monster'''. It is a level 2 [[enchantment spell]], and the [[spellbook]] takes 4 actions to read.

==Generation==
[[Wizard]]s may receive this spellbook as their starting non-{{of|spell|force bolt}} spellbook.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell acts similarly to a [[wand of slow monster]]: if you cast it at a [[monster]] and they do not resist, it renders them slow (i.e. 2/3 of their normal speed). If the target(s) were already [[fast]], they are returned to normal speed. If cast at a [[vortex]] or [[air elemental]] while it has you [[engulfed]], you are immediately expelled.<ref>[[Spl1-343.txt]]</ref> If zapped at yourself, you lose any intrinsic speed you have.

==Strategy==
The spell of slow monster is considered inferior to the {{spell of|sleep}} spell in most applicable scenarios, unless the target monster(s) has both high [[speed]] and [[sleep resistance]], such as [[energy vortex]]es and [[Vlad the Impaler]] - such monsters are generally rare, however. The spell is also somewhat useful for escaping whirly engulfing monsters; this gives it a marginal use case on the [[Plane of Air]], where it will allow you to escape [[air elemental]]s.

Pacifist may find this more useful for deterring dangerous monsters and/or escaping some engulfers; many other players prefer to read it for confusion-on-demand from forgetting the spell, then [[polypile]] it or blank it to write another desired spellbook with a [[magic marker]].

==History==
The spellbook of slow monster and its spell first appear in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of teleport away {144141 2022-01-13T23:36:09Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Strategy */ wording {{spellbook|name=teleport away|level=6|type=escape|turns=36|direction=beam|equiv=[[wand of teleportation]]|abundance=1.52%}}

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of teleport away''' allows you to learn the '''spell of teleport away'''.

== Effects ==
The spell is a beam-type spell that can be aimed at monsters or at yourself.

===Teleporting yourself===
Casting this spell at yourself has the same effect as the [[teleport at will]] action or zapping yourself with a [[wand of teleportation]] - unless you are on a [[no-teleport]] level, you teleport to a random square on the current level that you can stand on (e.g. in your default form, you won't end up over water, inside a wall or monster, on a trap, etc.). The teleportation is not inherently controlled, but if you have [[teleport control]], you can use that to control your destination.

=== Teleporting monsters ===
The spell can be used on monsters, with similar effects to a [[wand of teleportation]]; the monster will [[teleport]] to a random square on the current level on which it can survive. (The major difference is that, as a spell, it costs nutrition and Pw rather than wand charges.) Only a very few monsters can resist the effect ([[Death]], [[Pestilence]], and [[Famine]] will normally teleport next to you rather than to a random square); however, note that although [[covetous]] monsters can be affected by the spell, there is typically no point in doing so as the monster will simply teleport back next to you as part of its next turn.

== Strategy ==
Once [[teleport control]] is available, the spell can be used as a primary method of travel; prior to [[NetHack 3.6.2]], however, the [[Pw]] cost was too high to be sustainable for most characters, even with help from the [[Eye of the Aethiopica]]. As with most things that burn so much resources, the obvious use for it would be the [[ascension run]], but there are two factors making the spell less usable for that purpose: the [[Amulet of Yendor]] not only blocks 1/3 of teleportation attempts but also increases spell Pw costs (on average, doubling them - meaning that the spell is effectively 3 times as expensive in Pw during an ascension run).

Instead, late in the game, the spell is best used to clear your path of monsters. If you do not need the [[experience]], [[intrinsics]], or [[death drop]]s from a monster – and during the ascension run, you typically don't – teleporting it away is as effective as killing it, and much faster. The spell can even be used on multiple monsters at once, if they happen to form a line; on the [[Astral Plane]], this is sometimes combined with [[jumping]] to jump into the gap thus created).

Earlier in the game, there are two main uses for the spell. One is as an emergency escape from a dangerous situation, hoping to land somewhere safer. On most levels, you are very likely, but not guaranteed, to land somewhere out of danger; bear in mind that, without teleport control, there is always a chance you will move just a square or two and still be adjacent to whatever danger was threatening you. The other is to escape disconnected areas, which can arise either from [[vault]]s or due to a chokepoint that's guarded by monsters you don't want to deal with. However, as a level 6 spell, many characters will not be able to cast it until near the end of the game anyway, and will use other more accessible means of teleportation (e.g., a wand or [[scroll of teleportation]]).

However, the spell ''does'' has some advantages over teleport at will. One is that you can use it even when you don't meet the requirements to teleport at will; in particular, many players wish to avoid gaining [[teleportitis]] until they have a reliable source of teleport control, but the spell can be used even without teleportitis. The other is that the spell benefits from [[hungerless casting]]. As of NetHack 3.6.2, both actions now cost the same amount of power to perform, providing another advantage to the spell.

== History ==
In [[NetHack 3.6.1]] and earlier, this spell was somewhat more expensive in Pw than [[teleport at will]]; at the time, teleport at will cost 19 Pw, teleport away cost 30 Pw).

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''[[spellbook]] of turn undead''' allows you to learn the '''spell of turn undead'''. It is the [[special spell]] for [[Knight]]s.

==Effects==
The spell has the same effect as the [[wand of undead turning]]: casting it creates a beam which deals 1d8 damage to [[undead]] monsters it hits (doubled for a knight with the [[Magic Mirror of Merlin]]), and [[scare]]s them into fleeing if they fail a [[Magic resistance (monster)|resistance check]]. It also has the ability to '''"unturn dead"''',<ref>{{function|zap.c|unturn_dead}}</ref> which [[revive]]s [[corpses]] and rejuvenates [[egg]]s.

==Strategy==
Like the wand, the spell is not very useful offensively, especially due to its high [[power]] cost. The spell (and wand) are primarily used to bring a useful pet back to life, or to freshen the rotten corpse of a large monster (e.g. a [[giant]]) so that it can be safely eaten for intrinsics or stat gains.

While it can be theoretically used to revive [[dragons]] for another chance to drop [[dragon scales]], this is not recommended, since a revived dragon only has a 1/20 chance to leave scales as opposed to the normal 1/3.

In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''spellbook of wizard lock''' allow you to cast the '''spell of wizard lock'''. It is a level 2 [[matter spell]].

==Effects==
When cast, the effect is the same as that of a [[wand of locking]], closing and locking any open doors and lockable containers in the direction it was cast; if cast at an empty doorway, it will create a locked door. Further information can be found on [[Wizard lock]].

==Strategy==
Like the wand, the spell of wizard lock is useful for closing doors at a range, which is handy when escaping from certain monsters or else securing a room for other reasons, such as [[nurse dancing]] or sacrificing at an [[altar]] found outside of a temple. It can also be used with the {{spell of|knock}} to weaponize the [[castle]] [[drawbridge]]; however, the wand may be preferable for all these purposes due to the power cost, unless there is a means of power regeneration/recovery on hand. Both this and the knock spell can also be used to train up skill in [[matter spells]] in order to cast high-level spells such as {{spell of|polymorph}} and {{spell of|dig}}.

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], the spell of wizard lock has a different effect on the new indestructible doors introduced at the top level of [[Vlad's Tower]] - it only closes the doors without locking them. ("The door swings shut!")

}}
A '''potion of polymorph''' is a type of [[potion]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. can be used to 

==Generation==
Monsters may receive the potion of polymorph as a [[miscellaneous item]].

==Description==
The potion has various effects depending on its use, and can [[polymorph]] items, [[monster]]s or the player.

===Quaffing, throwing and wielding===
{{main|Polymorph}}

[[Quaff]]ing this potion will cause you to polymorph. Monsters can also quaff this potion; mercifully, this will not generate out-of-depth monsters.{{refsrc|Muse.c|1794}} [[Throw]]ing this potion at a [[monster]] will cause it to polymorph, as will [[wield]]ing the potion and smashing it on them.

===Dipping===
{{main|polypiling}}

[[Dip]]ping an [[item]] into this potion may polymorph the item. Invocation items, the Amulet of Yendor, and spellbooks/wands/potions of polymorph will never be polymorphed; other artifacts have a 95% chance of resisting, while other items have a 5% chance of resisting.<ref>[[Potion.c#line1610]]</ref> The usual checks for golem creation, items vanishing, artifacts resisting, etc. are skipped, but large stacks still merge to small ones.<ref>[[Potion.c#line1647]]</ref> Dipping this potion into another, non-{{! of|water}} potion will similarly polymorph the other potion, rather than resulting in random [[alchemy]].

Items that resist polymorphing will not use up the potion or break [[polypileless]] conduct - however, an item may accidentally polymorph into itself, which you receive the message "Nothing seems to happen"; this uses up the potion and breaks polypileless. In both cases, the potion isn't formally identified, but you can #name it, since both messages are different from the "Interesting..." that usually appears when nothing actually happens after dipping.

==Strategy==
Wielding the potion and hitting a monster is not advised because if by an unlucky chance that monster becomes a cockatrice, you will be petrified.

===Identification===
Most players can easily identify the potion by dipping an item into it, especially as quaffing may destroy some of your armor. Some conduct players prefer to [[Potion#Price identification then quaffing|price-id]] or otherwise identify 200zm potions to avoid breaking polyselfless or polypileless conducts. Here are a few other methods that do not require magical identification:

* Dipping a resistant item, such as a wand of polymorph or the [[Bell of Opening]], is always safe and doesn’t use up the tested potions.

* Quaffing while wearing an [[amulet of unchanging]] uses up the potion, but prevents it from taking effect; fortunately, all the other 200 zm potions are safe to drink as well (although you may want to bless them first).

* Quaffing with a source of [[polymorph control]] will pull up a prompt; you can then choose to [[Polymorph#Polymorphing into your own race|polymorph into your own race]], which doesn't break the conduct, but may have other undesired effects.

* Monsters with [[monster difficulty|difficulty]] 5 or less are occasionally generated with one as their [[miscellaneous item]], and watching one drink the potion will identify it. You could also try leaving 200 zm potions in the path of intelligent monsters.

* [[Potion#Unicorn horn dipping|Dip-testing]] with a [[unicorn horn]] is a suitable method, provided you are not using your only unicorn horn; using a spare horn can also yield a [[magical tool]].

&&%s&& %s Potion of speed {144944 2022-03-17T02:43:28Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* SlashTHEM */ oops {{potion|name=speed|cost=200|muse=misc}}

The '''potion of speed''' is a [[potion]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
Randomly generated monsters may receive a potion of speed as a [[miscellaneous item]], with a {{frac|5|6}} chance of one appearing in a monster's [[monster starting inventory|starting inventory]] if a speed item is chosen.{{refsrc|src/muse.c|2034|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Effects==
[[Quaff]]ing a potion of speed temporarily grants very fast [[speed]] and heals [[wounded legs]]. The duration of higher speed depends on the potion's [[beatitude]]:

* Blessed: 160–169 turns
* Uncursed: 100–109 turns
* Cursed: 40–49 turns

Quaffing the potion while already very fast adds the number of turns to the current duration if applicable. Inhaling [[vapors]] from a shattered potion gives you 1-5 turns of very fast speed and prompts you to type-[[name]] the potion.

==Strategy==
Early in the game, a potion of speed allows you to outrun enemies you either aren't ready for or need separation from (e.g., [[Team Ant]]), or pummel enemies that have you trapped - even cursed potions are worth drinking in this regard.

If you find or decide to wish for [[speed boots]] later on, these potions become viable candidates for [[alchemy]]: they are typically preferred for upgrading {{! of|healing}} potions to {{! of|extra healing}} potions, and this also works for dipping a stack of them in a potion of healing. Even so, potions of speed can still serve uses in the [[endgame]] - if you decide to swap your speed boots for [[jumping boots]] on the [[Astral Plane]], a potion of speed will allow you to remain very fast. This is particularly useful if you are also using a [[wand of teleportation]], because it increases your chances of being able to jump through the path you have cleared before monsters can reoccupy it.

==History==
The potion of speed has been present in the game since Hack 1.21, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

==Messages==
{{message|You are suddenly moving much faster.|You gained very fast speed from quaffing the potion.}}
{{message|Your legs get new energy.|You extended the duration of very fast speed by quaffing the potion.}}
{{message|Your knees seem more flexible now.|You inhaled the vapors from an shattered or boiled potion of speed.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], two potions of speed can be found in the outside area of [[Grund's Stronghold]], and four more are placed within the stronghold itself.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], the potion of speed gives intrinsic speed and a short duration of very fast speed, making it less likely to be used for [[alchemy]]; it also effectively replaces the [[wand of speed monster]], which grants temporary very fast speed, as an intrinsic speed source.

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, brewing a potion of speed using a [[chemistry set]] in [[SlashTHEM]] uses up three charges.

A '''potion of monster detection''' is a [[potion]] that will show all monsters on the current level when [[quaff]]ed.

== Effects ==

A blessed potion will show all monsters on the map for 21–60 (more) turns.{{refsrc|potion.c|630}} 

An uncursed potion will show just the monsters against a black background,{{reffunc|detect.c|monster_detect}} and will exercise [[Wisdom]] if any are found.{{refsrc|potion.c|647}}

A cursed potion has the same effect as an uncursed potion, but will also wake all sleeping and paralyzed monsters on the level.{{refsrc|detect.c|625}}

If you already have 300 or more turns of monster detection, a blessed potion will only add one more.

If you quaff a potion of monster detection while [[hallucinating]], it will not reveal the monsters' true identities. However several snapshots can make the typical movement patterns of [[shopkeeper]]s and [[aligned priest|priests]] visible.

== Messages ==
{{message|Monsters sense the presence of you.|You drank a cursed potion and woke up some monsters.}}
{{message|You feel threatened.|You quaffed a non-blessed potion, there were no monsters on the current level, and you aren't a [[beginner]].}}

==Strategy==

Some players save one or two of these potions to bless and drink on the [[Astral Plane]], because it is the quickest and easiest way to locate and keep track of all the monsters, and it doesn't have any of the disadvantages of [[telepathy]] (you don't have to blind yourself, and it works on mindless monsters).

Otherwise, it's not a terribly useful potion and is a good candidate for [[dilution]].

&&%s&& %s NetHack 3.1.0 {148857 2022-10-19T23:07:28Z {679 Ray Chason} /* Availability */ Google Groups is no longer useful; link to nethack.org {{NetHack Versions}}

'''NetHack 3.1.0''' is the 16th public release of [[NetHack]] and the twelfth by the [[DevTeam]].  [[Izchak Miller]] published it to the [[Usenet]] newsgroup comp.sources.games and the moderator approved it in January 1993.

== Availability ==

The [[DevTeam]] has mirrored the original Usenet posts on [https://nethack.org/download/3.1.0/ their web site].

[[Ali Harlow]][http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/front.html] has a NetHack 3.1.0 distribution at [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/source/nethack-3.1.0.tar.gz].

== Significant changes ==

NetHack 3.1.0 significantly revises the dungeon and adds many new monsters and objects:

* A branched dungeon is introduced, adding the [[Gnomish Mines]], a revised [[Oracle]] level, a [[Big Room]], the [[Quest]]s, [[Fort Ludios]], [[Medusa's Lair]], the [[Elemental Planes]], and a revised [[Astral Plane]]. [[Vlad's Tower]] is relocated into its own branch.

* [[Hell]] is revised and is now called [[Gehennom]]. Entering Gehennom without [[fire resistance]], while still not exactly wise, is no longer an [[instadeath]]. Levels in [[Gehennom]] now have [[stairs]] going both up and down.

* Gehennom now has special levels for [[Asmodeus]], [[Juiblex]], [[Baalzebub]], and [[Orcus]]. The [[Wizard's Tower]] and the [[Fake Tower]]s take their modern forms.

* The [[Wizard of Yendor]] no longer has the [[Amulet of Yendor]], but the [[Book of the Dead]]; the Amulet is now in the [[Sanctum]], requiring the [[invocation ritual]] to retrieve it.

* Dungeon lighting now uses line-of-sight calculations.

* [[Moloch]] is introduced, along with a new background mythology.

* The [[alignment]]s of some roles are revised.

* [[Strength]], [[dexterity]], [[constitution]], and [[wisdom]] can now be exercised or abused.

* The encumbrance system is redone, giving the modern statuses of Burdened, Stressed, Strained, Overtaxed, and Overloaded.

* Monsters can now use certain items such as [[weapon]]s, [[wand]]s and [[scroll]]s. The MUSE symbol enables this behavior.

* In addition to the existing [[MS-DOS]] port using overlays, a new port is provided for 386-based computers, using [http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/ DJGPP].

* The [[graphical user interface]] is now handled through special sections of the code, which can be linked or not as needed. The supported GUIs are [[X11]], [[Mac]], and [[Amiga]], but there is no support for [[tileset|tiles]].

== The adventurer ==

The player may choose from these roles:

{| class="prettytable"
|-
!Role!!Alignment!!Alignment in [[NetHack 3.0.10|3.0.10]]
|-
|[[Archeologist]]||Lawful||Lawful
|-
|[[Barbarian]]||'''Neutral'''||'''Chaotic'''
|-
|[[Caveman|Cave(wo)man]]||Lawful||Lawful
|-
|[[Elf]]||'''Chaotic'''||'''Lawful'''
|-
|[[Healer]]||'''Neutral'''||'''Lawful'''
|-
|[[Knight]]||Lawful||Lawful
|-
|[[Priest|Priest(ess)]]||'''Random'''||'''Neutral'''
|-
|[[Rogue]]||Chaotic||Chaotic
|-
|[[Samurai]]||Lawful||Lawful
|-
|[[Tourist]]||Neutral||Neutral
|-
|[[Valkyrie]]||'''Neutral'''||'''Chaotic'''
|-
|[[Wizard]]||Neutral||Neutral
|}

All classes permit male and female adventurers, except the Valkyrie which must be female.

The adventurer has [[experience]], [[hit points]], [[magical energy]],
[[armor class]], [[alignment]], and the six major [[attribute]]s.  He may
advance to [[experience level]] 30.

The initial [[pet]] is a little [[dog]] for Cavemen and Samurai, a [[kitten]] for Wizards,
and a random choice of the two (or the user's choice in his [[options]]) for all others.

== Dungeon features ==

The main trunk of the dungeon begins at level 1, where the game begins, and proceeds down [[stairs]] to [[Medusa's Lair]] and the [[Castle]].  From there, it is necessary to enter a [[trap door]] to the [[Valley of the Dead]].  Further stairs down eventually lead to the invocation level.  Performing the [[invocation ritual]] at the [[vibrating square]] opens the stairs to the [[Sanctum]].

With the [[Amulet of Yendor]] in hand, the adventurer may ascend from level 1 into the [[Plane of Earth]]; thence s/he may proceed through [[magic portal]]s to the planes of [[Plane of Air|Air]], [[Plain of Fire|Fire]], and [[Plain of Water|Water]], and thence to the [[Astral Plane]].  Offering the [[Amulet of Yendor]] on the correct [[high altar]] wins the game.

Along the way, one will encounter these branches and special levels:

* A second [[stair]] to the [[Gnomish Mines]].  Therein, one will find [[Mine Town]] and, at the end, the bottom level with a [[luckstone]].

* The [[Oracle]] level.

* A possible [[Bigroom]].

* The [[Rogue level]].

* The [[magic portal]] to the [[Quest]].

* A possible [[magic portal]], inside a [[vault]], to [[Fort Ludios]].

* [[Medusa's Lair]].

* The [[Castle]].

* The [[Valley of the Dead]].  [[Gehennom]] begins here, and it is no longer safe to [[pray]].

* The lairs of [[Asmodeus]], [[Juiblex]], [[Baalzebub]], and [[Orcus]].

* A second upward [[stairs|staircase]] to [[Vlad's Tower]].

* The [[Wizard's Tower]]; it is visible but not accessible from here.

* A [[Fake Tower]] containing a random [[Amulet]].

* A [[Fake Tower]] containing a [[magic portal]] by which the Wizard's Tower may be entered.

To win the game, it is necessary to complete these tasks:

* Gather seven candles, possibly in the [[lighting shop]] (not yet tended by [[Izchak]]) in [[Mine Town]].

* Complete the [[Quest]] and get the [[Bell of Opening]].

* Kill [[Vlad the Impaler]] and get the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]].

* Kill the [[Wizard of Yendor]] and get the [[Book of the Dead]].

* Proceed to the [[vibrating square]] and perform the [[invocation ritual]].

* Kill the [[high priest]] of [[Moloch]] and get the [[Amulet of Yendor]].

* Escape from the dungeon.

* Pass through the [[Elemental Planes]].

* Arrive at the correct [[altar]] in the [[Astral Plane]].

* Offer the [[Amulet of Yendor]] to the god of your [[alignment]].

[[Special room]]s are:

* [[throne room]]
* [[swamp]]
* [[vault]]
* [[beehive]]
* [[crypt]]
* [[barracks]]
* [[treasure zoo]]
* [[Oracle]]
* [[temple]]
* [[shop]]

Special [[dungeon feature]]s are:
* [[pool]]
* [[moat]]
* [[water]]
* [[drawbridge]]
* [[lava]]
* [[door]]
* [[ladder]]
* [[fountain]]
* [[throne]]
* [[sink]]
* [[altar]]
* [[ice]]
* [[air]]
* [[cloud]]

Traps are:

* [[arrow trap]]
* [[dart trap]]
* [[falling rock trap]]
* [[squeaky board]]
* [[bear trap]]
* [[land mine]]
* [[sleeping gas trap]]
* [[rust trap]]
* [[fire trap]]
* [[pit]]
* [[spiked pit]]
* [[trapdoor]]
* [[teleportation trap]]
* [[level teleporter]]
* [[magic portal]]
* [[web]]
* monsters disguised as [[statue]]s
* [[magic trap]]
* [[anti-magic field]]
* [[polymorph trap]]

A [[wand of wishing]] is guaranteed in the [[Castle]], in its modern position, and protected by [[Elbereth]], but not tucked inside a [[chest]].
