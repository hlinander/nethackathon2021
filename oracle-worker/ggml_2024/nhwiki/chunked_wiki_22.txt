&&%s&& %s Amulet of magical breathing {131916 2020-02-07T09:31:35Z {4000865 Tomsod} /* Effects */ drowning and bonus exp {{amulet|name=amulet of magical breathing}}
An '''amulet of magical breathing''' grants extrinsic [[breathless]]ness to its wearer.

==Effects==

The amulet allows you to travel underwater safely, although your items will still become [[wet]]. You cannot choke over your food, and you are immune to the effects of poison clouds from a [[green dragon]]'s breath, [[scroll of stinking cloud]], or the lava on the [[Plane of Fire]].

Wearing this amulet protects from [[drowning attack]]s.  Relatedly, you won't get the bonus 1000 [[experience points]] for killing [[sea monster]]s with this attack while wearing it.{{refsrc|src/exper.c|119|nethack=3.6.4}}

Less helpfully, when you are unbreathing, water is considered a safe teleport location. This means that while wearing this amulet, uncontrolled [[teleportation]] can land you in water, making all your stuff wet.

==Generation==

[[Amulet]]s comprise 1% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 1% in containers, and 4% in Gehennom. There is a 6.5% chance that a randomly-generated amulet will be an amulet of magical breathing.

==Identification==

This amulet can be easily identified by falling into water; if you don't attempt to crawl out, the amulet must be magical breathing. As always, items in your inventory are susceptible to water damage when you enter water, so be sure to drop vulnerable items first.

If you don't want to bother with skinny-dipping, allow yourself to be engulfed by a fog cloud instead. The amulet of magical breathing negates the fog cloud's physical damage and produces the alternate message "You are laden with moisture and find it mildly uncomfortable".

An alternative and rarely used method to identify an amulet of magical breathing is to wear it and overeat. If you vomit, then the amulet was magical breathing, and if not, you're most likely dead (unless the amulet happens to be {{of|amulet|life saving}}).

==Messages==

{{message|You fall into the water. You sink like a rock. But you aren't drowning. You touch bottom.|You fell into the water while wearing the amulet.}}
{{message|You stuff yourself and then vomit voluminously.|You were saved from [[nutrition|choking]] by the amulet.}}

These are the same messages given when polymorphed into a naturally [[breathless]] monster.

==Strategy==

This amulet can save you from [[drown]]ing yourself and from being drowned. It is thus a good thing to be wearing while fighting [[sea monster]]s toe-to-toe.

It can also be used to substitute for a [[tinning kit]]: whereas tinning a corpse reduces its nutrition to a manageable amount (thus allowing you to safely eat several large corpses in a row, such as [[giant]]s), this amulet lets you eat any sized corpse without worrying about choking, and vomiting does not affect your chances of getting [[intrinsic]]s from corpses. This amulet can also be helpful if dealing with several [[troll]]s, by eating them. Be aware, though, that using an amulet of magical breathing in this way often results in your character becoming [[satiated]], which [[abuses]] your dexterity.

If flying monsters die over a body of water, or if you lose projectile weapons by hitting a creature flying over the water, you may retrieve the items while wearing this amulet. Of course, the items could simply be teleported out of the water with a [[wand of teleportation]], but there's no telling where they'll end up. They could also be snatched up with a [[bullwhip]] while levitating, if not too heavy.

If you polymorph into a [[metallivore]], eating an amulet of magical breathing has a chance of conferring magical breathing as an [[intrinsic]]. This has the slight disadvantage water will become an eligible spot to place you when you level teleport, possibly wetting your inventory.

[[Levitation]] and [[water walking boots]] don't work on the [[Plane of Water]], making this amulet the most reliable way to cross between bubbles. Self-[[polymorph]] is dangerous, as it may time out unexpectedly, or end prematurely due to something like a [[psi bolt]] from the [[Wizard of Yendor]].

&&%s&& %s Scroll origins {148192 2022-09-20T04:45:08Z {4001042 Bleem} /* Meanings */ etaoin shrdlu is a little more interesting than that Unidentified [[scroll]]s can have any one of many labels. In [[Hack 1.0]], these labels are initially paired with the scroll types in a way that seems to be meaningful.{{refsrc|def.objects.h|175|version=Hack 1.0|comment=list of [[Hack 1.0]] scrolls and their initial labels}} It is often claimed that Hack 1.0 uses a fixed label for each scroll type, but in fact it does shuffle the labels.{{refsrc|hack.o_init.c|60|version=Hack 1.0|comment=this section of code executes once per object type, and shuffles the descriptions of all object types that have descriptions except [[tool]]s}}

==Meanings==

The various labels through [[NetHack 3.6.0]], and their meanings, are:

; ANDOVA BEGARIN : Unknown meaning. In [[Hack]], this scroll is initially used for the [[scroll of fire]]. Possibly "End Of A Beginning"
; DAIYEN FOOELS : "Dying fools".  Originally [[scroll of enchant weapon]].
; DUAM XNAHT : "Thanx Maud" spelled backwards. Originally [[scroll of amnesia]].
; ELAM EBOW : Unknown meaning. Originally [[scroll of magic mapping]]. When looked at backwards, it sounds close to "woe be male"; this could be a reference to the stereotype that men do not like to ask for directions.
; ELBIB YLOH : "Holy Bible" spelled backwards. Originally [[scroll of genocide]].
; FOOBIE BLETCH: Unknown meaning; possibly related to hacker jargon 'foobar', 'bletch'. In Hack 1.0, this is initially a spare label.
; GARVEN DEH: Unknown meaning; possibly a Star Wars reference to Garven Dreis. In Hack 1.0, this is initially a spare label.
; HACKEM MUCHE : "Hack 'em much". Originally [[defunct features|scroll of damage weapon]]; the [[scroll of charging]] now occupies this slot.
; JUYED AWK YACC : Tenuous reference to Unix tools ed(1), awk(1), yacc(1).  Originally [[scroll of destroy armor]].
; KERNOD WEL : "Kenned well" in Scots. Originally [[scroll of identify]].
; KIRJE : Finnish for "a letter" (as in a letter sent by [[mail]]). The [[scroll of mail]] was added in [[Hack 1.0.2]], and the choice of initial label suggests that the labels are indeed meaningful.
; LEP GEX VEN ZEA : Unknown meaning. Originally [[scroll of create monster]], and "LEP GEX" is the rather monstrous leopard gecko.
; NR 9 : Possible reference to The Beatles' confusing Revolution No. 9. Originally [[scroll of confuse monster]].
; PRATYAVAYAH : "Reverse annoyance" in Sanskrit. Originally [[scroll of remove curse]].
; PRIRUTSENIE : "Taming" in Russian, a transliteration of [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/приручение приручение]. The romanization is slightly irregular: the character "ч", transcribed as "TS", is conventionally rendered in "CH". Originally [[scroll of taming]].
; READ ME : "Read me". Originally [[scroll of blank paper]]. A README is a rudimentary form of end-user documentation.  May also be a reference to Alice in Wonderland, where Alice finds small cakes labeled "EAT ME" and small bottles labeled "DRINK ME".
; TEMOV : Unknown meaning. Possibly "Vomit" backwards and misspelled. Also, Temov is a common Eastern European surname. In Hack 1.0, this is initially a spare label.
; THARR : "There's gold in them thar hills!". Originally [[scroll of gold detection]].
; VE FORBRYDERNE : "Woe to the criminals!" in Danish. Originally [[scroll of punishment]].
; VELOX NEB : Unknown meaning (but ''velox'' is Latin for "fast", maybe "fast any be"?). In Hack 1.0, this is initially a spare label.
; VENZAR BORGAVVE : Unknown meaning. Originally [[scroll of teleportation]].
; VERR YED HORRE : Unknown meaning; maybe referencing "or" - light in Hebrew? Originally [[scroll of light]].
; XIXAXA XOXAXA XUXAXA : Spanish (archaic spelling) for "mwahahahaha", a stereotypical evil laugh. Originally [[scroll of scare monster]].
; YUM YUM : "Yum yum!" Originally [[scroll of food detection]].
; ZELGO MER : Unknown meaning. Originally [[scroll of enchant armor]].

Some [[variant]]s add extra scroll names, to accommodate additional scrolls. [[NetHack 3.6.0]] adds no new scrolls, but does add some new names that originally appeared in one or more variants:
; [[wikipedia:Etaoin shrdlu|ETAOIN SHRDLU]] : The most common letters in English, in order. The first two columns of a [[wikipedia:Linotype_machine#Keyboard|Linotype keyboard]], used in print media in 1886 until the 1980s, are ETAOIN and SHRDLU. A mistyping was typically corrected by running fingers down these two columns, typing "ETAOIN SHRDLU", a phrase that signals the next operator to remove the erroneous line.
; LOREM IPSUM : [[wikipedia:Lorem ipsum|Latin-derived filler text]].
; [[wikipedia:Fnord|FNORD]] : Nonsense word central to the ''Principia Discordia'', made popular by the ''Illuminatus!'' trilogy.
; KO BATE : Line from Kurd Lasswitz's book ''Auf zwei Planeten''.
; ABRA KA DABRA : Traditional incantation, as engraved on amulets and as stereotypically used by stage magicians.
; ASHPD SODALG : From ''Portal'': ASHPD is the acronym for a portal gun; SODALG is [[wikipedia:GLaDOS|GLaDOS]] spelled backwards.
; ZLORFIK : Alien swearword from the computer game ''Zak McKracken''.
; GNIK SISI VLE : "Elvis is King" spelled backwards. Used as words of power in ''Zak McKracken''.
; [[wikipedia:Hapax legomenon|HAPAX LEGOMENON]] : "A thing said once," that is, a word or phrase occurring once in a written corpus.
; EIRIS SAZUN IDISI
; PHOL ENDE WODAN : First lines of the two [[wikipedia:Merseburg_Incantations|Merseburg incantations]].
; [[wikipedia:Ghoti|GHOTI]] : A phonological respelling of "fish".
; MAPIRO MAHAMA DIROMAT : Incantation featured a scene in the computer game ''Wizardry''.
; VAS CORP BET MANI : One variant of the Armageddon spell in the ''Ultima'' game series; translated as "Great death, small healing."
; XOR OTA : "Atorox" spelled backwards. Atorox is a robot from the works of [[wikipedia:Aarne Haapakoski|Aarne Haapakoski]].
; [[wikipedia:Str%C4%8D prst skrz krk|STRC PRST SKRZ KRK]] : "Stick your finger through your throat". Czech and Slovak tongue-twister.

Because there are many more scroll labels than types of scrolls, not all of these are used each game.

==Variants==

{{todo|Add scroll origins from more variants}}

Some variants add more scrolls and scroll labels.

===SpliceHack===

The following scroll labels were added in [[SpliceHack]]<ref>https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/blob/Spl-R-1.1.0/src/objects.c</ref>

; 4OFAE OF9 SCC9 : A reference to the [[wikipedia:Voynich manuscript|Voynich manuscript]].
; TEMP USF UGIT : The Latin phrase "[[wikipedia:tempus fugit|tempus fugit]]", often translated in English as "time flies". Initially [[scroll of time]].
; [[wikipedia:potestas|POTESTAS]] : A Latin word meaning "power".
; TRATS ARL : "LRA START" spelled backwards. It may be a reference to the [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC8HFop6fV0RTznzFo7ZC-A LRA START] YouTube channel.
; TLON UQBAR : A reference to [[wikipedia:Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius|Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]].

; NYEHEHE : A laughing noise.
; ELPHE MONATER
; ABAJ
; CONGLATURATION : A mistranslation from the [[wikipedia:Ghostbusters_(1984_video_game)|1984 Ghostbusters game]].
; DESUM TETRAL
; NHIRL : An abbreviation of "NetHack In Real Life".
; PEBCAK RTFM : Two slang abbreviations common in IT and engineering, [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/PEBCAK PEBCAK] and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/RTFM RTFM].

&&%s&& %s Unique monster {149428 2022-12-17T00:32:33Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Description */ adjust In ''NetHack'', there are various '''unique monsters''' that are generally only generated once, which is governed by the <code>'''G_UNIQ'''</code> flag in the code.

==Description==
A unique monster that is generated and then killed usually will not be generated again, although it is usually possible to reanimate most unique monsters from their [[corpse]]s or using [[stone to flesh]] on their [[statue]], provided they leave a corpse (and are not [[corpseless]]) and are not immune to [[stoning]] in the first place (e.g. as with most [[quest]] nemeses). The [[Rider]]s in particular are capable of resurrecting from their own corpses.

Unique monsters cannot have [[figurine]]s generated of them, and [[wishing]] for one will result in a random figurine being given instead.{{refsrc|src/objnam.c|3955|nethack=3.6.6}} If the corpse of a unique monster would be left in a [[bones]] file, it is replaced with the corpse of a [[doppleganger]], and a statue of a unique monster found in bones will turn into a doppleganger in the guise of that monster if revived via stone to flesh.{{refsrc|src/bones.c|152|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/trap.c|587|nethack=3.6.6}} Trying to wish for a statue of a unique monster and reanimating it will also produce a doppelganger disguised as that monster.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|608|nethack=3.6.6}}

The primary exception to the rule of not being generated again after death is the [[Wizard of Yendor]], who can resurrect himself one level stronger after each death.

==List of unique monsters==
The following is a list of unique monsters:

* [[Riders]]:
** {{monsymlink|Death}}
** {{monsymlink|Famine}}
** {{monsymlink|Pestilence}}
* All [[quest]] leaders and nemeses
* {{monsymlink|Vlad the Impaler}}
* [[Demon lords and princes]]:
** {{monsymlink|Juiblex}}
** {{monsymlink|Yeenoghu}}
** {{monsymlink|Orcus}}
** {{monsymlink|Geryon}}
** {{monsymlink|Dispater}}
** {{monsymlink|Baalzebub}}
** {{monsymlink|Asmodeus}}
** {{monsymlink|Demogorgon}}
* {{monsymlink|Croesus}}
* {{monsymlink|High priest}} of Moloch and the other gods
** An [[aligned priest]] can become a high priest by [[growing up]]
* {{monsymlink|Medusa}}
* {{monsymlink|Oracle}}
* {{monsymlink|Wizard of Yendor}}
* [[Defunct features|Defunct monsters]]
** {{monsymlink|Cerberus}}
** {{monsymlink|Goblin King}}
** {{monsymlink|Charon}}
** {{monsymlink|Earendil}} and Elwing

The [[long worm tail]], {{monsym|long_worm_tail}}, is an unusual case: it is a dummy monster that exists purely to represent the worm's body on the visual interface, and is marked unique primarily in order to prevent figurines of it generating.{{refsrc|src/monst.c|2709|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Variants==
More unique monsters are often added in variants of ''NetHack'' - as a general rule, this includes quest leaders and nemeses, who are not specified in the lists below unless they are deferred or otherwise unused monsters.

===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] adds many new unique monsters:

* All new quest leaders and nemeses
* {{monsymlink|Ruggo the Gnome King}}
* {{monsymlink|The Largest Giant}}

Generally it isn't a good thing. Appears under maintenance on things to avoid. [[User:Lotte|Lotte]] 02:16, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

== If NetHack was released today... ==

Imagine this: the game we know as [[NetHack 3.4.3]] did not exist (nor any of its predecessors, like Rogue or Hack). Rather, it was published ''today'' as ''NetHack 1.0''. NetHack is closed source. Rec.games.nethack is established and NetHack immediately gains the user base it currently has in real life, too. Now, I was wondering, how long do you think it would take for anyone to ascend for the first time? Remember, no one would even know about the invocation rituals or anything, you'd just know about the standard message about Moloch and Marduk. Of course, there would be no spoiler files available, and if the game was closed source, they couldn't be generated. The main source of information would pretty much be the Oracle &mdash; and experience; your own and of those who post to rec.games.nethack. The Guidebook would of course be there too. Personally I'd guess it'd take a year or so before the first ascension by anybody. Opinions? Views? Guesses? Or is this just such a ridiculous thought that it should be sucked away by a mind flayer and never spoken about anymore? :) --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 22:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

:[http://www.urbandead.com Urban Dead] is ''somewhat'' like that; it's a new game (about a year old) with a large fanbase, and an active wiki. The source is unavailable, and yet people have already figured out item generation probabilities to a [http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Search_odds remarkable degree of accuracy]. NetHack is a much, much deeper game, but there's not much that can't be discovered with a little patience and a lot of players. The details of magic cancellation would be tricky.
:One of the more notable YANIs I've read recently has the DevTeam releasing the next version privately to the /dev/null guys so that the world is forced to compete unspoiled. I like that idea an awful lot. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 14:26, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

'''RogueBasin''' is a [[wiki]] about [[roguelike]] games in general, now located at roguebasin.com ... [[you]] can now participate by [[roguebasin:Special:Userlogin|creating an account]].

Some interesting pages:
* [[roguebasin:NetHack|NetHack]]
* [[roguebasin:Hacklike|Hacklike]] versus [[roguebasin:Band|Band]]
* [[roguebasin:Definition|Definition]] - "What is a roguelike?"

In addition, RogueBasin has many pages about individual roguelike games and some pages about roguelike programming. Some roguelike developers create pages about their own games, while a few players post reviews of the games.

== Conditions for RogueBasin editors ==
While RogueBasin was at roguebasin.t-o-m-e.net, Spam forced it to restrict editing to registered users and to block the creation of new user accounts, except through an [https://web.archive.org/web/20160409165900/angband.oook.cz/rgrd.php?showpost=75394 alternate process] publicised in some [[Usenet]] groups but not the wiki itself. In practice, this made registering an account and contributing to RogueBasin somewhat worthless, because few others would be able to create an account and edit those contributions.

Thus [https://web.archive.org/web/20160409165900/http://angband.oook.cz/rgrd.php?showpost=79040 The Quest for the new RogueBasin]. Users of rec.games.roguelike.development discussed new hosting for RogueBasin. DarkGod, the maintainer of [[ToME]], gave a copy of the MediaWiki 1.3.9 database to Björn Bergström of [http://roguelikedevelopment.org roguelikedevelopment.org]. The wiki has now finally replaced the default MediaWiki flower with a new logo from an old logo contest. Also, [[you]] can now register an account on the wiki. The site is currently using MediaWiki version 1.15, a rather recent version.

== Statistical comparison between RogueBasin and NetHackWiki ==
RogueBasin currently uses a slightly older version of MediaWiki, a popular wiki engine that we share with them, while we have the latest stable version. [[We]] at [[NetHackWiki]] can do a few things that RogueBasin editors currently cannot; for example, we can upload screenshots to our articles.

A '''blindfold''' is a tool that can be used to achieve [[blindness]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You can no longer wear a blindfold in a form with no head.}}

== Generation ==

There is a guaranteed blindfold on the first level of [[Vlad's Tower]].

[[Samurai]], [[Rogue]]s, and [[Wizard]]s each have a 20% chance of starting with a blindfold.

== Strategy ==
After gaining intrinsic [[telepathy]] by eating a floating eye corpse, applying a blindfold is good for detecting monsters such as that [[leprechaun]] who stole your money or those [[soldier ant]]s you want to avoid.

A blindfold is also useful if you are about to encounter a monster that can do you harm with its gaze ([[floating eye]], [[pyrolisk]], [[Medusa]]) or that can blind you ([[yellow light]]).

However, a [[towel]] is strictly better than a blindfold, since it also gives temporary blindness when needed, and it has other uses too.

* [[Zen]]: a conduct requiring permanent blindness

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The blindfolding was performed by binding a piece of the
yellowish linen whereof those of the Amahagger who condescended
to wear anything in particular made their dresses tightly round
the eyes.  This linen I afterwards discovered was taken from the
tombs, and was not, as I had first supposed, of native
manufacture.  The bandage was then knotted at the back of the
head, and finally brought down again and the ends bound under
the chin to prevent its slipping.  Ustane was, by the way, also
blindfolded, I do not know why, unless it was from fear that she
should impart the secrets of the route to us.

&&%s&& %s Gehennom {143488 2021-10-29T09:55:06Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''Gehennom''' is the underworld of ''[[NetHack]]'', whose entrance is located in the [[Valley of the Dead]]. It is situated beneath the [[Castle]], consisting of 20&ndash;24 total levels, and is the area that [[Moloch]] has hidden the [[Amulet of Yendor]] within, as indicated by the [[introduction]] text. Gehennom is technically considered its own [[dungeon branch]], with the Valley as its first floor, but begins where the main dungeon terminates.

==Levels==
Gehennom is full of mazes. Among these are the lairs of several [[demon]] lords and princes (including [[Orcus Town]]), an upstairs branching off to [[Vlad's Tower]], the [[Wizard's Tower]], and a couple of [[Fake Wizard's Tower]]s (one of which contains the portal to the main tower).

The second level of Gehennom from the bottom contains the [[vibrating square]]. When the [[player]] performs the [[invocation ritual]] on the vibrating square, it creates a down staircase that grants access to [[Moloch's Sanctum]] - the lowest level of Gehennom and the dungeon as a whole. While performing the ritual is the only way to gain access to the Sanctum, it can be entered like any other level afterward (e.g., via [[level teleport]]).

The following special levels will always occur within Gehennom in each game, with their level ranges given as follows:{{refsrc|dat/dungeon.def|51|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=The number pairs denote a range of possible lengths for branches as well as a range of possible locations for special levels - e.g., the Dungeons of Doom can terminate at the Castle within a range of 5 floors starting from the 25th inclusively (meaning that the Castle can occur on DL 29 at lowest).}}

*[[Valley of the Dead]] (1st level of Gehennom, Dungeon Level 26&ndash;30)
*[[Asmodeus' Lair]] (2nd to 7th level of Gehennom, DL 27 to DL 36) 
*[[Juiblex's swamp]] (4th to 7th level of Gehennom, DL 29 to DL 36) 
*[[Baalzebub's Lair]] (6th to 9th level of Gehennom, DL 31 to DL 38) 
*[[Orcus-town]] (10th to 15th level of Gehennom, DL 35 to DL 44) 
*[[Wizard's Tower]] (three consecutive levels, 11th to 18th levels of Gehennom, DL 36 to DL 47) 
*[[Fake Wizard's Tower]]s (two separate levels, 3rd to 6th levels from bottom, DL 40 to DL 51) 
*[[Vibrating Square]] (2nd level from bottom, DL 44 to DL 52) 
*[[Moloch's Sanctum]] (Bottom level, DL 45 to DL 53) 

Additionally, there will be a set of stairs leading up to [[Vlad's Tower]] somewhere between levels 9 and 13 of Gehennom (DL 34 to 42). This up stairway can be on any of the special levels which may occur between levels 9 and 13, but the Tower itself is ''not'' counted as part of Gehennom - this is signified when you enter and are informed that "the heat and smoke are gone".

All levels of Gehennom that are not special levels (in the above list) are ordinary maze levels. See [[Mazes of Menace]] for a schematic illustration of the possibilities.

==Monsters==
Gehennom is coded to exclude [[lawful]] monsters;{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1473|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} note that this does not include special rooms such as graveyards and zoos, nor special levels within the branch that contain monsters of a specific [[monster class]].

The following monsters are excluded from normal [[monster creation]] in Gehennom, and are defined by the tag <code>G_NOHELL</code> in [[monst.c]]:

* [[freezing sphere]]s
* [[frost giant]]s
* [[ice troll]]s
* [[ice vortex|ice vortices]]
* [[winter wolf|winter wolves]] and [[winter wolf cub]]s

Conversely, these monsters are ''only'' subject to normal random generation in Gehennom, and are defined by <code>G_HELL</code> in monst.c:
* all {{mcsl|&}} major [[demon]]s other than [[foocubus|foocubi]]
* [[disenchanter]]s
* [[fire vortex|fire vortices]]
* [[green slime]]s
* [[hell hound]]s and [[hell hound pup]]s
* [[lemure]]s
* master and arch-[[liches]]
* [[salamander]]s
* [[steam vortex|steam vortices]]

==Religion==
[[Moloch]] is the only [[god]] with any power in Gehennom - any religious activity requiring interaction with your deity is considered to be directed to Moloch. As such, [[prayer]] in Gehennom will only result in negative outcomes - a consequence of this is that if your [[two-handed]] weapon is cursed while in Gehennom, you can't count on prayer to uncurse it. Your god still takes note of your actions in Gehennom so, e.g., killing a [[pet]] can still decrease alignment record and increase divine [[anger]].

Sacrificing at the [[altar]] in the [[Valley of the Dead]], [[Orcus-town]], or [[Moloch's sanctum]] will anger your god and reduce your [[alignment record]], [[wisdom]], and [[Luck]] - oddly, [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|same-race sacrifice]] on altars in Gehennom works much as normal for chaotic characters, though the altar will remain unaligned and they will still lose Luck.

This also means that [[Elbereth]] has no effect, and attempting to use the [[turn undead]] [[command]] will fail (although [[Spell of turn undead|the spell still works]]).

==Strategy==
Obtaining [[fire resistance]] before entering Gehennom is recommended - while not the difference between life and instant death as with its predecessor of [[Hell]], it is still vital to prevent Gehennom's [[fire trap]]s from reducing your maximum HP when triggered. Fire resistance will not protect your inventory, so be sure to fireproof your equipment and [[bag]] any [[potion]]s and [[scroll]]s that you might want to keep. [[Magic resistance]] is also near-essential, as there are many powerful spellcasters within - in particular, master and arch-liches are [[covetous]] and can warp to you an cast a spell before you can react.

Many of the demons and other monsters found in Gehennom are resistant to fire but not to ice - [[Frost Brand]] is a popular [[weapon]] for this area, as is [[Demonbane]] to a lesser extent. [[Silver saber]]s are also effective against demons, shades and vampires, with the [[artifact]] saber [[Grayswandir]] being the most effective for Gehennom by far.

[[Holy water]] works as normal, but fire traps make them and the [[scroll of remove curse]] risky to carry in open inventory. Furthermore, if your weapon and shield (or two-handed weapon) become cursed, you will not be able to retrieve bagged potions and scrolls reliably or pray to uncurse them. In addition to taking the above risk, you can use the #[[tip]] extended command to empty a container and get at your curse-removing items.

Maze levels are tedious and time-consuming to explore manually, and this has given Gehennom a reputation as a boring phase of the game. See [[Gehennom mapping]] for suggested mapping strategies.

==History==
Gehennom is introduced in [[NetHack 3.1.0]] - in previous versions, the underworld was called [[Hell]], and required fire resistance to enter and traverse the area without immediately being [[instadeath|burnt to death]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna)}}
Gehennom is a name for the Valley of Hinnom (or ''Gehinnom'') that surrounded western parts of Jerusalem's Old City; the name is derived from the Aramaic ''Gehenna''. Gehennom plays a significant role in the Hebrew Bible—several chambers for burial and cremation were located in the valley, and some of the kings of Judah were said to engage in Moloch-worship there (hence Moloch's association with Gehennom in ''NetHack'').

The book of Jeremiah has the practice forcibly ended with the destruction of the valley's shrine, and Jeremiah prophesies that Jerusalem would meet a similar fate. Combined with the aforementioned practices, this made the area and its name synonymous with an image of destruction, where wicked souls were sent to be purified (i.e., the Valley of the Dead). While distinct from other abodes of the dead within biblical and rabbinic literature, the King James translation refers to it as "hell", influencing its portrayal in art, literature and other media.

== Variants ==
Many variants are based on [[NetHack 3.4.3]], which did not yet have the #tip command. For those variants and earlier versions of ''NetHack'', it is common to leave a cache of holy water potions or scrolls of remove curse in certain locations to access in the event cursed items leave you without a free hand.

=== Lethe patch ===
{{main|Gehennom (Lethe patch)}}
The [[Lethe patch]] includes a restructured Gehennom, including a number of unique levels.

=== UnNetHack ===
''[[UnNetHack]]'' implements several changes to reduce the tedium of the mazes in Gehennom, mostly from the [[Heck² patch]] and portions of the [[Lethe patch]]. Certain special levels have been modified or given alternate versions, including the [[Valley of the Dead]], [[Moloch's Sanctum]], and the lairs of the various demon lords. Two new branches can be accessed through stairs throughout Gehennom, (and possibly also through portals in the Valley of the Dead): the [[Dragon Caves]], and [[Sheol]]. Additionally, several new monster appear in Gehennom and in Sheol.

===SLASH'EM===
In ''[[SLASH'EM]]'', Gehennom consists of only 17 levels, but includes lairs for all of the unique demons:<ref>{{semsrc|dat/dungeon.def}}</ref>

* 1st level: [[Valley of the Dead]]
* 2nd through 6th levels: Four of these five levels are [[demon]] lairs, one each for [[Juiblex]], [[Yeenoghu]], [[Orcus]], [[Demogorgon]].
* 7th through 9th levels: [[Wizard's Tower]]
* 10th through 15th levels: Four of these six levels are [[devil]] lairs, one each for [[Baalzebub]], [[Geryon]], [[Dispater]], [[Asmodeus]]. The other two levels contain [[Fake Wizard's Tower]]s.
* 16th level: [[vibrating square]]
* 17th level: [[Moloch's Sanctum]]

Of note is that Demogorgon's lair is infamously always above and before Asmodeus's lair, with Demogorgon being the most dangerous opponent by far while Asmodeus is typically the easiest.

The up staircases to [[Vlad's Tower]] and to [[Frankenstein's Lab]] are somewhere amidst the 3rd to 12th levels.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], wearing the [[Mitre of Holiness]] allows you to pray in Gehennom (including using #turn).

There are additional rooms in Gehennom, including some special rooms from [[xNetHack]].

The Fake Wizard's Towers can still spawn as regular rooms, but will never have a portal - the real Wizard's Tower can be entered from the bottom floor.

&&%s&& %s Fire trap {147827 2022-08-22T02:52:42Z {4000978 Aximili} explicit references block {{trap
 |name=fire trap
 |color=red
 |generation=Gehennom, mazes, some [[quest]]s, [[Plane of Fire]]
 |effect=Deals fire damage, burns inventory
}}

A '''fire trap''' is a [[trap]] that creates a column of flame underneath you.

==Generation==
Fire traps are only randomly generated in [[Gehennom]], maze levels (including to the left and right of the [[Castle]]), the [[Plane of Fire]], and some [[quest]]s, notably the [[Valkyrie quest]]. In Gehennom, fire trap generation is increased. 20% of all randomly generated traps in Gehennom are guaranteed to be fire traps.

A [[magic trap]] or [[container trap|trapped box or chest]] has a chance of acting as a fire trap even where a fire trap cannot be generated. A magic trap always acts as a fire trap if activated by a monster.

The [[Invocation ritual]] creates some fire traps.

==Effects==
If you lack [[fire resistance]], you take 2d4 damage, and your maximum HP is reduced by between zero and the damage you took. If you are fire-resistant, you lose 0 or 1 HP, and your maximum HP is unaffected. {{refsrc|src/trap.c|3125|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on player}} {{refsrc|src/trap.c|2383|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on monsters}}

The trap will attempt to burn an article of clothing with an equal chance of each of 5 types (helm, torso, shield, gloves, or boots) being selected. If the selected armor is not torso, but is either fireproof, thoroughly burnt, or not worn, a different type of armor will be selected. If blessed, the chance of the selected armor burning is subject to luck consideration. If the final armor selection is not body armor (regardless of whether the armor survived the luck roll), there is a {{frac|3}} chance that scrolls, potions, and spellbooks in the main inventory will not be subject to burning. Otherwise all scrolls, potions, and spellbooks will have a {{frac|3}} chance of burning. Additionally, the fire trap may dry a wet [[towel]].  {{refsrc|src/trap.c|56|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on inventory}}

Unlike most traps, fire traps will still activate if you [[jump]] over them.

If a fire trap is created on top of [[ice]] (which is common in the [[Valkyrie quest]]), stepping on it will melt the ice and replace it with a pool of water, potentially resulting in [[drowning]].

=== Golems ===
Fire affects certain golems in a slightly different way{{refsrc|src/trap.c|2403|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on golems}} {{refsrc|src/trap.c|3149|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=Effect on player polymorphed into a golem}} when it comes to maximum HP loss. These golems take the 2d4 damage, but their maximum HP is affected as follows:  

* [[Paper golems]] lose between max HP and max HP (i.e. they are destroyed)  
* [[Straw golems]] lose between 0 and either damage taken or 1/2 max HP (whichever is greater)
* [[Wood golems]] lose between 0 and either damage taken or 1/4 max HP (whichever is greater)
* [[Leather golems]] lose between 0 and either damage taken or 1/8 max HP (whichever is greater)

The logic for this is that paper burns the fastest and leather the slowest.

Paper golems destroyed by fire traps do not leave behind scrolls.

==Removal==
[[Dig]] a pit into the ground while standing on the trap, then fill the pit. 

==Strategy==
It is important to obtain fire resistance before entering Gehennom, to avoid frequently taking damage from these traps. Keep scrolls, potions and spellbooks in a [[container]].

==History==
Fire traps were introduced in [[NetHack 3.1.0]]. This was the same release that replaced [[Gehennom]] with [[Hell]], hence removing the instadeath caused by entering Hell without fire resistance.

The special effects on golems were introduced in [[NetHack 3.4.1]].<ref>https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/b440613866d55c6c870459ca9b1c5f83274ab4a6#diff-2be946c8163de6b6a37eb30f92f75c431695ceec2040c5bef32855d7457f1a3f</ref>

==Messages==
{{message|A tower of flame erupts from the floor!|You triggered a fire trap.}}
{{message|A cascade of steamy bubbles erupts from the pool!|You triggered a fire trap underwater.}}
{{message|A cascade of steamy bubbles erupts from the box!|You triggered a fire trap on a box, underwater}}
{{message|You smell smoke.|A nearby fire trap that you can't see was triggered.}}
{{message|A tower of flame erupts from the floor under <monster>!|A monster triggered a fire trap within you sight.}}
{{message|You see a tower of flame erupt from the floor!|An invisible monster triggered a fire trap within your sight.}}

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], it is possible to disarm a fire trap with a non-cursed [[potion of water]], similar to using a potion of oil on a squeaky board. This will also generate 1&ndash;4 [[Potion of oil|potions of oil]] based on [[Luck]]. Since oil can then be diluted back to water, the large number of fire traps in Gehennom offer an effective way of multiplying one's water potions.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
'Let him be for a while,' said Cohen.  'I reckon the fish disagreed with him.'
'Don't see why,' said Truckle.  'I pulled him out before it'd hardly chewed him.  And he must've dried out nicely in that corridor.  You know, the one where the flames shot up out of the floor unexpectedly.'
'I reckon our bard wasn't expecting flames to shoot out of the floor unexpectedly,' said Cohen.
Truckle shrugged theatrically.  '_Well_, if you're not going to expect unexpected flames, what's the point of going _anywhere_?'

&&%s&& %s Demon {149058 2022-11-20T03:30:41Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* Demons summoning demons */ amorous demon disparity is no longer a bug '''Demons''' are a group of [[monster]]s mostly found in [[Gehennom]]. They are divided into two categories: '''minor demons''' and '''major demons'''. All minor demons are represented by {{white|i}}, and all major demons by {{white|&}}. (The {{white|&}} glyph is also shared by some monsters which are not considered demons, such as the [[riders]].) There are also several unique and named major demons.

== Types of demons ==

The imps and minor demons are represented by {{white|i}}.  Internally, NetHack calls this symbol S_IMP. Monsters in this class:
* {{monsymlink|manes}}
* {{monsymlink|lemure}}
* {{monsymlink|homunculus}}
* {{monsymlink|imp}}
* {{monsymlink|quasit}}
* {{monsymlink|tengu}}

The ordinary major demons are represented by {{white|&}}.  Internally, NetHack calls this symbol S_DEMON.  NetHack recognizes this class with the macro function is_demon defined in [[Mondata.h#line93|mondata.h on line 93]], which simply checks whether or not the monster has the M2_DEMON attribute. Monsters in this class:
* {{monsymlink|water demon}}
* {{monsymlink|horned devil}}
* {{monsymlink|succubus}}
* {{monsymlink|incubus}}
* {{monsymlink|erinys}}
* {{monsymlink|barbed devil}}
* {{monsymlink|marilith}}
* {{monsymlink|vrock}}
* {{monsymlink|hezrou}}
* {{monsymlink|bone devil}}
* {{monsymlink|ice devil}}
* {{monsymlink|nalfeshnee}}
* {{monsymlink|pit fiend}}
* {{monsymlink|balrog}}

[[Djinni|Djinn]], [[mail daemon]]s, [[sandestin]]s, and the [[riders]] are also represented by {{white|&}}, but they are ''not'' considered demons, as they lack the M2_DEMON attribute.

=== Unique demons ===
{{main|Demon lords and princes}}
The named demons are divided into two ranks: the lower '''demon lords''', and the higher '''demon princes'''. There are also two [[Quest nemesis|quest nemeses]] who happen to be demons.

The demon lords are:
* {{monsymlink|Juiblex}}
* {{monsymlink|Yeenoghu}}

The demon princes are:
* {{monsymlink|Orcus}}
* {{monsymlink|Geryon}}
* {{monsymlink|Dispater}}
* {{monsymlink|Baalzebub}}
* {{monsymlink|Asmodeus}}
* {{monsymlink|Demogorgon}}

Of these, Juiblex, Orcus, Baalzebub and Asmodeus have lairs within Gehennom, and are guaranteed to appear in every game.  The others may be summoned, and will not necessarily appear in a given game.

The quest nemesis demons cannot be summoned by other demons. They can cast [[summon nasties]], but since they are outside of Gehennom, the probability that they will summon other demons is low.
* {{monsymlink|Minion of Huhetotl}}, the [[Archeologist]] quest nemesis
* {{monsymlink|Nalzok}}, the [[Priest]] quest nemesis

== Characteristics ==

Although minor demons are rarely a significant threat, major demons are quite strong opponents and can summon other major demons and unique demons. ([[Foocubus|Foocubi]] and [[balrog]]s cannot summon, but other demons can summon them.)  The unique demons are very strong and can be dangerous in some circumstances. For instance [[Asmodeus]] is lethal if you lack [[cold resistance]], and [[Orcus]] carries a [[wand of death]].

All major demons resist [[fire]], [[poison]], [[level drain]], and [[death ray]]s, although they are still considered living creatures. Major demons cannot be tamed unless [[you]] are polymorphed into a demon yourself. All demons except tengu can be [[Silver#silver damage|burned by silver]] for an extra d20 damage.

Non-unique major demons generated at the time of level creation have an 80% chance of starting out asleep, unless you possess the [[Amulet of Yendor]] in which case they will always be awake.{{refsrc|makemon.c|1035}} This does not apply to those generated after level creation.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|In Gehennom, the presence of a demon lord or prince will now block others on the same level from teleporting.}}

== Demon summoning ==

[[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|Sacrificing your own race]] can summon a major demon or a demon lord (but not a demon prince), as can [[anger]]ing a chaotic god when on an [[altar]] (by [[pray]]ing with negative alignment, converting a chaotic altar, or a few other actions).

== Demons summoning demons ==

This section of the page is based on a spoiler by M. Stage which can now be accessed [http://web.archive.org/web/20080415192434/http://www.nethack.de/spoiler/demon_summoning.txt on the web archive] or [http://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.nethack.de/spoiler/demon_summoning.txt on alt.org's mirror of www.nethack.de].

Every major demon and unique demon has a {{frac|13}} chance of summoning (sometimes called "gating in") another major demon or unique demon every time it acts when adjacent to you.<ref>[[mhitu.c#line589]] /* Special demon handling code */</ref> The only exceptions among monsters recognized internally as demons are [[Foocubus|foocubi]] and [[balrog]]s. (They themselves are capable of being summoned by other demons, however.) The difference between demons, demon lords, and demon princes lies in which other demons they can summon, and how often. [[Quest nemesis]] demons can summon, but cannot be summoned. The flag "generated only in Gehennom" is ignored. Demons will never summon demons while attacking other monsters, therefore tame demons will not normally summon other demons (which would be hostile, anyway).<ref>[[Mhitu.c#line482]], [[Wizard.c#line432]], [[Minion.c#msummon]],[[Minion.c#ndemon]],[[Makemon.c#mkclass]]</ref>

The following table shows the chance of a given & gating in another & of specific type according to M. Stage's demon-summoning spoiler.

{| class="prettytable"
! rowspan=2| Summoner
! colspan=3| Summoned demon
|-
| Non-unique major demon
| Demon lord
| Demon prince
|-

| 5%
|}

Summoned demons will always be the same alignment as the summoner&mdash;that is, summoners are only capable of summoning co-aligned demons. The Wizard of Yendor's summon nasties (remote or in person) is an exception: he can create any demon.  Non-unique demons will summon demons of their own type 79% of the time.{{refsrc|minion.c|87|nethack=3.6.1|comment=5/6th of a 95% chance}}

According to the spoiler, if you are trying to summon [[Demogorgon]] (perhaps as an unofficial [[conduct]]) the quickest way to do it is with a [[haste self|hasted]] [[Orcus]]. If you  are wearing [[speed boots]], the chance of getting [[Demogorgon]] per turn is {{sfrac|13}}&nbsp;× {{sfrac|5|100}}&nbsp;= {{sfrac|1|260}} per turn. Your chance of having summoned [[Demogorgon]] after ''n'' turns is then:

{| class="prettytable"
! Number of turns ''n''
! Chance of [[Demogorgon]]
|-
| 1
| 0.38%
|-
| 50
| 17.5%

|-
| 200
| 53.7%
|-

|-

| 97.9%
|}

=== Summoning while polymorphed ===

If you are polymorphed into a major demon that can summon, and you hit a monster with bare or gloved hands, there is a 1 in 13 chance of summoning a [[tame]] demon at your side, announced with the message "Some hell-p has arrived!"<ref>{{function|uhitm.c|demonpet}}</ref> This chance occurs on each attack, so a demon with many attacks, such as a [[marilith]], will be more likely to summon a demon.

When a demon is summoned, it will be of the same type as your current form {{frac|5|6}} of the time and a random demon of the same alignment as you the rest of the time. You will never summon a unique demon.

== Variants==

=== SLASH'EM ===
[[SLASH'EM]] adds these imps and minor demons:
* {{monsymlink|dretch}}
* {{monsymlink|rutterkin}}
* {{monsymlink|nupperibo}}
* {{monsymlink|blood imp}}

It also intoduces these major demons:
* {{monsymlink|spined devil}}
* {{monsymlink|bearded devil}}
* {{monsymlink|bar-lgura}}
* {{monsymlink|chasme}}
* {{monsymlink|babau}}
* {{monsymlink|nabassu}}

SLASH'EM gives every unique demon a lair, so all of them are guaranteed to appear in a game.

=== UnNetHack ===
[[UnNetHack]] adds [[uranium imp]]s as a new minor demon.

A [[Shambling horror (UnNetHack)|shambling horror]] (represented by {{cyan|U}}) can be defined as a demon in certain games. If this happens, they can be summoned through demon gating, and they can summon other demons.

[[Angel]]s and demons attack each other on sight, as part of Nephi's grudge patch.

=== SpliceHack ===

'''Stormbringer''', often nicknamed '''Stormy''' by players, is an [[intelligent]] [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[chaotic]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[runesword]].

==Generation==
Stormbringer can appear as a [[sacrifice gift]] for chaotic characters, and is also the chaotic [[crowning]] gift. It is not randomly generated, since runeswords are not generated outside of [[wish]]es or [[bone]]s.{{refsrc|mkobj.c|403|comment=Random artifacts are only generated by upgrading their base items.}}

==Effects==
Stormbringer grants +1d5 [[to-hit]] and deals an extra +d2 in bonus [[damage]] to monsters without [[drain resistance]] - the life-draining further reduces the target's level by 1, and lowers their current and maximum HP appropriately (usually by 1d8).{{reffunc|makemon.c|monhp_per_lvl}} The wielder will then be healed for half of the reduced HP, rounded down - thus, for the typical 1d8 drain damage, 2 HP will be healed on average.

Stormbringer also confers [[drain resistance]] when wielded and is itself immune to [[drain life]] and other similar attacks{{refsrc|zap.c|drain_item|comment=Objects that grant drain resistance when equipped, or those that grant drain resistance when carried, cannot be themselves be drained.}} - but it is also [[bloodthirsty]], attacking peaceful monsters and pets without confirmation if you attempt to move onto their square.

Levels drained from [[troll]]s with Stormbringer are permanently lost; levels drained from the [[Wizard of Yendor]] will be restored when he next revives. The [[Riders]] preserve their HP values at time of death and retain it for their revival, including any HP loss incurred from Stormbringer.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|606|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Stormbringer is among the most desirable chaotic artifacts in the game - [[twoweaponing]] Stormbringer with a [[silver]] weapon is particularly effective, since many drain-resistant monsters (including monsters with draining attacks) are ''also'' silver haters. Chaotic [[Ranger]]s will most appreciate an effective melee option, especially if they have not mapped out [[Gehennom]] to use their arrows reliably, while chaotic [[Priest]]s can pair it with their [[quest artifact]], [[the Mitre of Holiness]], to blunt damage from drain-resistant demons and undead.

However, those seeking to use Stormbringer as their main weapon should avoid using pets if possible, as even a careful player may accidentally attack a pet with it - if you elect to keep a pet on hand, you may consider unwielding Stormbringer or switching to a secondary weapon when not in combat, especially when dealing with [[aligned priest]]s or [[shopkeepers]]. Additionally, if any pets you plan to keep are not drain resistant, they should ideally have high enough health to withstand accidental hits and a way to increase their [[tameness]] to prevent them turning on you.

Players attempting to enchant Stormbringer to +7 will have to [[engrave]] with it to reduce its enchantment, rather than the standard drain life spell.

As most hostile spellcasters are either drain resistant or else possess high [[magic resistance (monster)|monster magic resistance]], Stormbringer can bypass the latter group's defenses to reduce their level where the drain life spell cannot (though it will often kill non-resistant monsters before the effects become noticable). Famine and Pestilence may also be ideal targets for the weapon in some situations, since they revive with their current max HP rather than their original base HP.

===Forcing Stormbringer===
Elven priests and elven rangers can arrange for their first [[sacrifice]] gift to be Stormbringer - since it will always be [[co-aligned]] and will not hate your race, only [[Sting]] and [[Orcrist]] compete with Stormbringer, and both of them can be #[[name]]d. In rare cases, if Stormbringer has already been generated on a bones level, this will preclude sacrifice gifts altogether. A [[helm of opposite alignment]] can remedy the situation.

Theoretically, almost anyone could get a guaranteed Stormbringer because it is enough to be polymorphed in elven form and become chaotic from the helm of opposite alignment - the exception is if you started as chaotic ''and'' your role gets a guaranteed first sacrifice gift. However, this will most often rank as a [[stupid ascension trick]], not as good general strategy advice.

==History==
Stormbringer is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, Stormbringer was one of many ways a player could enact [[drain for gain]].

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Stormbringer}}
Stormbringer is a weapon featured in a number of fantasy stories from author [[People of secondary interest to NetHack#Michael Moorcock|Michael Moorcock]] featuring Elric of Melniboné. Stormbringer is a cursed daemon sword with a will of its own and a hunger for souls, which it instills into Elric and frequently torments him with by using the bloodlust it creates to make him kill his friends and loved ones - Elric hates the sword, but is too dependent on its power. It physically appears as a black sword with runes engraved deep in the blade, reflected by its appearance as a runesword in ''NetHack''.

==Messages==
{{message|Your bloodthirsty blade attacks!|You moved into a peaceful or tame monster while wielding Stormbringer, causing you to attack them.}}
{{message|The black blade draws the life from <monster>!|You used Stormbringer to attack a non-drain resistant monster.}}

==Variants==

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], there is a runesword in the [[Lawful Quest]], which has a 5% probability of being Stormbringer if it hasn't already been generated.

Where most [[SLASH'EM artifacts|artifact weapons in SLASH'EM]] do their maximum damage bonus instead of a random number, Stormbringer's case is somewhat more complex - it has a regular damage bonus and a level-drain damage bonus, and rather than doing maximum damage on both, it does +2 for the regular damage bonus and continues to do 1d8 for the level-drain bonus, making it do on average only 0.5 damage points more than vanilla.

This makes it considerably weaker than other artifacts such as [[Excalibur]] and [[Snickersnee]] compared to vanilla, and dramatically weaker than the more powerful chaotic SLASH'EM artifacts such as the [[Bat from Hell]], [[Doomblade]], and [[Serpent's Tongue]]. However, it does enjoy a full +5 to hit as well as the hit point gain bonus, making it a significant boon in SLASH'EM's challenging early game. Additionally, its [[drain resistance]] makes it a useful alternate weapon when facing off against monsters with a [[wand of draining]] and late-game [[deep dragon]]s.

While SLASH'EM allows [[twoweapon]]ing with two artifacts, extrinsics granted by wielding the artifacts are only available for the artifact wielded in the primary hand - thus Stormbringer should be your primary weapon if you plan to utilize its drain resistance. Note that even wielding it in the off hand does not prevent its bloodthirsty attack, and the game will "taunt" you if you try. ("The black blade will not be thwarted!")

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], Stormbringer can be [[invoked]] to give the effect of reading a [[scroll of scare monster]]. 

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Stormbringer can be [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forged]] together with [[Grimtooth]] to create [[EvilHack#Forged Artifacts|Shadowblade]], an artifact [[athame]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
There were sounds in the distance, incongruent with the sounds of even this nameless, timeless sea: thin sounds, agonized and terrible, for all that they remained remote - yet the ship followed them, as if drawn by them; they grew louder - pain and despair were there, but terror was predominant.
Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever in thrall to some cruel and supernatural master.  He had heard men cry so when his salvation and his nemesis, his great black battle-blade Stormbringer, drank their souls.

A '''water demon''' is a type of [[demon]] that appears in the game, and one of the less powerful ones.

Like most [[demon|major demons]], water demons may summon other demons when they attack. At least {{frac|5|6}} of the summons will be other water demons. All chaotic demons are also eligible, but those whose [[difficulty]] is greater than the current dungeon level are exponentially unlikely.{{refsrc|makemon.c|1335}} In practice, that mixes a few [[foocubus|foocubi]] into the summons. There is a {{frac|260}} chance, however, that they may summon [[Juiblex]] or [[Yeenoghu]].

A player may not polymorph into a water demon.

==Generation==

In the early stages of the game, a common way to summon a water demon is by quaffing or dipping from a [[fountain]]. These demons may either be hostile or friendly; a friendly demon grants a [[wish]]. A demon will be hostile with probability (80 + LD)%, where LD is your current [[level difficulty]];{{refsrc|fountain.c|56}} thus, if you have the [[Amulet of Yendor]], a demon will always be hostile. Although water demons are relatively weak for demons, they are likely to wipe out most early-game characters. Players who cannot kill them quickly will probably find themselves fighting two or more.

==Strategy==
In the [[Game stages#The early game|early game]], don't quaff from fountains and try to keep use of fountains (dipping) to a minimum. Later on, when you're capable of easily taking on water demons and water mocassins and are carrying several [[escape item]]s, you can dip items repeatedly in all the fountains from DLvl 1 to 19 for the [[wish]], including in the mines. (This is somewhat safer than quaffing). The chances are very roughly {{frac|3}} that you'll get a wish from some water demon.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
[ The monkey king ] walked along the bank, around the pond. He examined the footprints of the animals that had gone into the water, and saw that none came out again!  So he realized this pond must be possessed by a water demon.  He said to the 80,000 monkeys, "This pond is possessed by a water demon.  Do not let anybody go into it."

After a little while, the water demon saw that none of the monkeys went into the water to drink.  So he rose out of the middle of the pond, taking the shape of a frightening monster. He had a big blue belly, a white face with bulging green eyes, and red claws and feet.  He said, "Why are you just sitting around?  Come into the pond and drink at once!"

The monkey king said to the horrible monster, "Are you the water demon who owns this pond?"  "Yes, I am," said he.  "Do you eat whoever goes into the water?" asked the king.  "Yes, I do," he answered, "including even birds.  I eat them all. And when you are forced by your thirst to come into the pond and drink, I will enjoy eating you, the biggest monkey, most of all!"  He grinned, and saliva dripped down his hairy chin.

'''Mjollnir''' (colloquially '''Mojo''') is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[neutral]] for wishing purposes, and its [[base item]] is a [[war hammer]]. It is the first guaranteed [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Valkyrie]]s.

One possible message for a [[T-shirt]] mentions Mjollnir.

==Generation==
Mjollnir is eligible for random generation: a war hammer has a {{frac|40}} chance of being Mjollnir, or {{frac|20}} if [[Ogresmasher]] has already been generated. In addition to Valkyries, any [[neutral]] character may receive Mjollnir as a random [[sacrifice]] gift. 

==Effects==
Mjollnir has +d5 to hit, and deals d24 extra [[shock]] damage against monsters without [[shock resistance]]; regardless of resistance, it also has a {{frac|5}} chance each of destroying [[wand]]s and [[ring]]s in the target's inventory.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1214|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Mjollnir's lightning strikes will also wake nearby monsters.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1220|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

If you are wielding Mjollnir, it is not cursed and you have 25 [[strength]] (e.g. from [[gauntlets of power]]), you can [[throw]] Mjollnir;{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|73|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|77|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} it can travel up to six squares, roughly half the distance of a normal thrown hammer.{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1070|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1250|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} If you are a Valkyrie, Mjollnir will return to you 99% of the time, and if you are not [[confused]], [[stunned]], [[blind]], [[hallucinating]], or [[fumbling]] when it returns, you will catch it 99% of the time.{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1146|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1165|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1319|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} If you fail to catch a returning Mjollnir, it has an equal chance of falling at your feet or else striking you and possibly destroying wands and rings.{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1338|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
{{main|Monster resistances}}
Very few monsters in the game resist lightning damage, and Mjollnir does a lot of it, making it an excellent weapon for a majority of the game. However, though the odds of throwing Mjollnir backfiring are miniscule, the fact that a chance exists at all is enough to put many players off the notion of throwing it; the chance of destroying rings and wands deters players who seek to preserve loot for similar reasons. As lawful Valkyries have access to [[Excalibur]], they are much more likely to make it their main weapon for the drain resistance, the [[stealth]] aid provided by its lack of noise and the damage bonus against ''all'' monsters. Despite these drawbacks, Mjollnir is still a very worthwhile artifact weapon for many neutral roles that seek one, especially [[Tourist]]s and [[Priest]]s.

There are few shock-resistant monsters usually encountered before the [[Castle]]: [[blue dragon]]s are quite rare, [[storm giant]]s are often not seen until [[Gehennom]], and [[electric eel]]s can be evaded and killed with other ranged attacks; [[pudding]]s and [[gelatinous cube]]s are not especially dangerous in comparison to these, even with Mjollnir's low base item damage. [[Energy vortex|Energy vortices]] are the primary danger if you are relying on Mjolnir as your main weapon and lack shock resistance (which Mjollnir does not provide).

From the Castle itself to the depths of Gehennom, [[arch-lich]]es are also one of the biggest obstacles for a player using Mjolnir (and a huge obstacle in general). Various other monsters such as [[angelic being]]s, [[green slime]]s, the [[Riders]] and hostile [[aligned priests]] (including the high priest of [[Moloch]]) also resist shock damage - green slimes and angelic beings can occur as summoned nasties, the [[Sanctum]] is full of hostile priests, and most of the listed monsters are encountered on the [[Astral Plane]].

Beware throwing Mjollnir at a [[disenchanter]]: Mjollnir still has a {{frac|10}} chance of being disenchanted, and does not produce a message if this happens like hitting a disenchanter in [[melee combat]] would.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|67295bc706525934c461a0d940ca0da39fc302d2|this commit}}, wearing non-metallic gloves (all but gauntlets of power) will protect worn [[ring]]s from electrical damage; this may provide further incentive to avoid throwing Mjolnir as a Valkyrie.}}
