&&%s&& %s Spell maintenance {143128 2021-10-06T18:06:25Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''Spell maintenance''' is a feature originating in [[FIQhack]], but which is also present in [[dNetHack]]. It allows you to maintain self-buffing spells continuously without needing to recast it every now and then, in exchange for it draining your energy reserves over time (which can potentially be outregenerated if your energy regeneration is fast enough). This energy cost will generally be twice the spell's level (or four times for light and protection) every 5 turns, but can be more with the Amulet or with a failure rate higher than 0%. Spell maintenance can wear off if your energy runs out, you become confused, or at random if your failure rate with the spell is high enough. Unlike normal spellcasting, in FIQhack (but not dNetHack), maintained spells will not drain any hunger over time. It will, however, also not exercise any skill.

These spells can be maintained:
* [[Spellbook of light|light]]
* [[Spellbook of haste self|haste self]]
* [[Spellbook of detect monsters|detect monsters]] (Skilled or above)
* [[Spellbook of levitation|levitation]]
* [[Spellbook of invisibility|invisibility]]
* [[Spellbook of protection|protection]]

In FIQhack, these new spells can also be maintained:
* [[Spellbook of astral eyesight|astral eyesight]]
* [[Spellbook of phase|phase]]

&&%s&& %s Devnull Tribute {144318 2022-02-02T11:51:29Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''/dev/null/nethack Tribute Tournament''' was a NetHack tournament that took place in November 2017. It was organized as a one time replacement for the [[:/dev/null/nethack tournament]] that was retired by its organizer Krystal in mid-September 2017, intended as "one last" /dev/null/nethack to conclude the long tradition of the tournament before it was replaced by [[The November NetHack Tournament|a different tournament running in the same time slot]].

==What remained the same==
* The timeframe was the same; the tournament ran from November 1st, 00:00 PDT (07:00 UTC) to December 1st, 00:00 PST (08:00 UTC).
* The tournament had the same [[:/dev/null/nethack tournament#Challenges|in-game challenges]] as /dev/null/nethack.
* The same [[:/dev/null/nethack tournament#Trophies|trophies]] were used.
* Clans, and their associated ''Best in Show'' trophy, worked the same way.
* Multiple servers were available.
* Bot announcements were available on relevant channels (#devnull_nethack and #hardfought.org) within the old [[Freenode]] IRC network (now Libera), although a different bot was used.

==What changed==

* The tournament ran on [[NetHack 3.6.0]], rather than [[NetHack 3.4.3]] (using effectively the same patches in each case).
* [[dgamelaunch]] was used as the game management front end, allowing for spectating and ttyrec recording.
* The [https://www.hardfought.org/devnull/ scoreboard] was rewritten from scratch.
* Game dumps were available (via the scoreboard).

==Game servers==

The first server (hardfought.org) was the master server where players registered their accounts; the other two remote servers synced the accounts from the main server (once per minute), and did not allow registrations themselves. Configuration files (rcfiles) were not synced automatically, but the dgamelaunch menu on each remote server could be used to copy the rcfile from the master server. There was also a web-based rcfile editor available at [https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/rcedit/rcedit-dn36 https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/rcedit/rcedit-dn36], which was the recommended way to create a configuration file. The state of challenges was shared between the servers.

==Contacts==
At the time of the tournament, the best way to contact the tournament organisers was via the #devnull_nethack or #hardfought channels on the Freenode IRC network. (Nowadays, #hardfought is almost certainly a better choice.)

* Maximum carry cap removed. With sufficient str and con a player may be able to carry as much as 1260 [[weight]]. [https://github.com/yrmvgh/FiddleHack/commit/dc99ebfdead5e0da85a7eec4cdde84adc4499645 git]
* (from dynahack) [[The Heart of Ahriman]] grants [[displacement]] as well as 1 power regen per turn. When thrown/fired as a projectile, it deals an additional 1d20 damage. [https://github.com/yrmvgh/FiddleHack/commit/b411b2a6494b7d0dea103fdb5531fcec90ba725e git]
* Chaotic Wish Improvements: heart of ahriman, and the [[Tsurugi]] count as chaotic for the purposes of wishing. Also, [[Diana]] counts as an elven bow to make it more appealing to elves. (b411b2a..55156f0)
* (inspired by Fourk) archons and floating eyes glow. floating lights glow a lot. [https://github.com/yrmvgh/FiddleHack/commit/6ec5ecf9c0a9046587d3eeb1b17a798146fa77cb git]
* "Racialize" starting inventory. This means each race starts with more stuff, so that from turn 1 each role/race combo hopefully feels a little more different. For instance: dwarves start with booze, gnomes get [[oil]] and [[grease]] and an [[aklys]], orcs get meat and poison, humans start with a "canteen" of alignment-based [[potion of water|water]], and elves always get an instrument.
** This has been rejiggered a few times, so check u_init.c if you want to see the latest stuff each race gets.
* Compared to FIQhack, wizard energy-regen and healer regen have been reduced below [[XL]] 11 and increased above XL 11. [https://github.com/yrmvgh/FiddleHack/commit/db319721622b6b79c50d04ec6fab25e9197e7fe1 git]
* Role [[HP]] cutoff rejiggered. The cutoff is now at level 12 for all roles. To compensate healers, they get 3 hp per level after the cutoff. [https://github.com/yrmvgh/FiddleHack/commit/3e974bbd31726038c271a22cff472fdb57a54fb0 git]
* Racial HP rejiggered. Humans scale past level 11 better than other races do, and Dwarves get a lot more hit points from 1 to 11. [https://github.com/yrmvgh/FiddleHack/commit/9a58d7218679f5b7d1228be17c25636dd2c0cad6 git]

The {{questmon|Necromancer|Elf|nemesis}} He guards [[the Palantir of Westernesse]] at the end of the [[dNethack]] [[Elvish Racial Quest]].

The Necromancer is a fairly simple quest nemesis. He is classified as a [[Wraith (monster class)|wraith]], and is one of the few "non-standard" monsters to [[Silver-hating|hate silver]]. Silver arrows work well for elven rangers, but he isn't particularly hard for priests, nobles, or wizards either. You'll want drain resistance (preferably) or a blindfold, as his life-draining gaze can quickly lower your level. Keep in mind he also has the ability to drain you with spells, so a blindfold will not fully replace drain resistance.

This is distinct from the Amulet theft attack possessed by the [[Wizard of Yendor]], which is AD_SAMU.

&&%s&& %s FIQHack/Pointers {143421 2021-10-26T00:57:15Z {4001427 Phollenback} /* Expert Skills */  formatting == Resistances ==

Items that formerly granted a "resistance" such as rings or [[object properties]] on armor, grant full immunity. Races and roles that have '''starting''' "resistances" get immunities in FIQhack as well, but level-up resistances, and any other sources of a resistance only halve the damage. Items that grant a resistance or an immunity will be labeled appropriately if you are confused, and the Oracle offers enlightenment as a service for gold!

== Monsters ==

Monsters cast spells like players do, which means they'll hit you with all their best spells until they run out of power. Even the lowly gnome wizard can now be packing [[force bolt]] and [[drain life]]!

On the plus side, powerful spellcasting monsters such as liches no longer have dangerous melee-range spells such as destroy armor and drain strength. However, they are perfectly capable of casting problematic spells like [[spellbook of slow monster|slow monster]] and [[fireball]]/[[cone of cold]]. Elbereth can give you far less safety, as casters and monsters with ranged attacks or wands will be happy to stay away and bombard you. Prepare accordingly.

Dragons are now much more dangerous, since your resistances will only halve the damage.  Watch out for yellow dragons!

Zombies are also much more dangerous to the inattentive player, as zombification disease can cause a [[delayed instadeath]].

== Weapons and Armor ==

The cloak of displacement has been buffed to give MC3, and the cloak of magic resistance now gives MC2. 

All DSM except for silver and gray have been buffed. If you can get reflection and magic resistance elsewhere, consider blue DSM, which grants speed, or orange, which grants free action, in additional to providing valuable immunities.

Easily the most important change in FIQhack is the introduction of object properties - while they're not as insane as GruntHack's items, for many characters, object properties can be a valuable source of immunities. Most magical armor and jewelry have relatively mundane properties, but they can be easily identified using a source of enlightenment. The advantages of possessing numerous immunities can make [[Fort Ludios]] an appealing location for players looking to fill out their kits. 

For players early in the game or those who choose not to use artifact weapons, weapons with properties can also be very useful. Be careful of wielding magical weapons, even uncursed ones, as the mercy property autocurses and converts your damage to healing. Thirsty, fire, cold, and shock weapons deal an extra 1d6 to non-resistant targets and can be easily identified by throwing the weapon up while wearing a hard helmet.

== Wands / Attack Spells / Dragonbreath ==

The above can now ignore reflection, so you'll want not just reflection, but also resistances or immunities to all elemental damage types, if possible. Keep in mind that crowning has been buffed and provides intrinsic acid resistance. At least either fire or cold immunity is recommended.

== Expert Skills ==

Having expert skill in wand and a blessed wand equals "master" level skill effects. For many wands, expert skill doesn't matter, but for many wands it does; here's a selection of some of the best effects:

* Use locking to abuse special levels with master wands
* Master locking with wands replaces a door or doorway with a secret door (which is hidden until you uncover it)
* Master wand of lighting light up an entire level
* Master secret door detection also detects traps
* Master cancellation can cancel '''everything''', including Rodney or the Riders
* Master polymorph can actually be useful offensively

Expert divination allows you to detect fooproofing status with the Identify spell.

=== Bugs ===

Please submit bugs on the [http://roguelikes.live/nh4-bugzilla/ official NH4 bug tracker]!

=== Monster/player symmetry ===
* Monster [[magic mapping]]: every monster has a flag denoting whether it knows the layout of current level.  Monsters that are generated on level creation, or appear randomly, start knowing the current level; those that migrate or are summoned do not, and need some form of magic mapping to obtain this knowledge.  (Or possibly just to spend enough time on the level: while the player's away, the monsters may as well explore it.)  [[Amnesia]] attacks may remove the flag.  Not knowing the level prevents warping to the stairs, and teleporting to the player may fail if there are walls around you.  The flag may also improve the monster's ability to track you.  Named demons should probably start with some magic mapping scrolls (or the spell), to preserve their ability to escape.  -Tomsod

=== FIQhack YANIs ===

* Phasing spell could be targeted on other creatures as well. -flump

* Smarter searches would help when trying to find, for instance, all headgear and not specifically "helms". -flump

*  Greed as an object property for containers: the container will refuse to open 80% of the time, costing a turn. Either any gold put into the container vanishes permanently or gold weighs nothing when in the container. -FIQ -jonadab

*  You can wish for object properties in FIQhack, but only on items that aren't inherently magical. -aosdict

=== YANIs that are OK'd ===

* Stunning currently works quite differently on players and monsters. -shping

* Player monsters should always resist conflict. -FIQ

&&%s&& %s Variant paranoia {131494 2020-01-26T06:11:40Z {4000978 Aximili} Add category '''Variant paranoia''' is a phenomenon that can occur when a player begins playing a new NetHack version or [[variant]]. It occurs when the player believes that certain events are due to deliberate changes made in the variant whereas they are actually just happening randomly. These usually only happen when the player thinks a change has been made against the player's favor.

Examples include:
* The chance of getting an artifact via wishing has been nerfed. (The RNG is rolling the wrong numbers, or some other artifacts generated that you don't know about.)
* A certain monster has been buffed and is more deadly. (It's just getting high damage rolls.)
* A monster's difficulty number has been changed, because it appeared earlier than it should have. (Bones or a polymorph trap.)

Blessed potions will never grant the player an intrinsic they already have. The intrinsic lost or gained will be explicitly stated to the player. Possible intrinsics that can be acquired far exceed the number that can be normally gained. These include:

== Dipping == 

Weapons, armor, weapon-tools, and jewelry, including [[unicorn horn]]s, will consume the potion when [[#dip|dipped]], attempting to give the item a random object property appropriate to its class if the potion is noncursed and removing one if it is cursed.

If the potion is noncursed, there is a

:<math> {1}-(\frac{1}{n+1})</math> chance that all properties are lost and a

:<math>(\frac{1}{n+1})</math> chance that a property is added, where ''n'' is the number of existing properties.

Dipping other types of items as well as artifacts has no effect and will not consume the potion.

== Strategy ==

Quaffing the potion can be tempting, as many of the intrinsics are otherwise unattainable and can be quite alluring such as magic resistance and reflection. However, with such a variety of options, it's highly unlikely that you will obtain specific desirable intrinsics while risking dangerous ones such as polymorphitis and slowness. It's probably better to use this to give ordinary, replaceable equipment properties, as they can be easily discarded if they gain a useless or harmful property.

&&%s&& %s Damage type {129889 2019-12-21T03:21:25Z {4000978 Aximili} Add links and category Every attack in NetHack has a defined '''damage type'''. This determines how the attack affects the target when it hits (as opposed to [[attack type]], which determines how the attack makes contact with the target). There are many damage types and many effects for the wide assortment of monsters in NetHack. They are defined in [[monattk.h]] and used to specify monster attacks in [[monst.c]].

Many damage types actually cause no HP damage; instead, the damage dice are used for the duration of an effect. However, the code is often inconsistent with when this applies.

Combining some attack types with certain damage types may lead to some unexpected effects. For example, giving a monster a weapon attack with a blinding damage type will cause it to blind the player as intended when the weapon hits, but it will not actually deal any damage.

Many damage types' effects can be negated through [[magic cancellation]], but only if the attack is of an appropriate type. For these and most other damage types, the effect will also be negated if the monster is [[cancelled]].

|-
|AD_DREN || Drain energy || Yes {{footnote|Only if maximum Pw is 0.}} || Yes
| Mostly the same effects as an [[anti-magic field]]. On the player, this will drain [[energy|Pw]], and maximum Pw if current Pw is 0. However, unlike an anti-magic field, this will cause HP damage if maximum Pw is 0. Happens only 25% of the time. || only [[energy vortex]]
|-
|AD_LEGS || [[Wounded legs|Wounding legs]] || Yes || No
| Causes [[wounded legs]] to the player. Against monsters, it counts as physical damage. || only [[xan]]
|-

| Causes the target to be stuck to the attacking monster and unable to move from that space until the monster is killed or otherwise releases them. || only [[lichen]], [[violet fungus]], large and giant [[mimic]]s
|-
|AD_SGLD || [[Steal gold|Stealing gold]] || Yes || No
| If the target is carrying any gold, steal some or all of it, or else snatch some gold that the player is standing on (this only works against the player). || only [[leprechaun]]
|-
|AD_SITM || [[Theft (attack)|Stealing one item]] || No || No
| Steals a single item from the target. Monsters that steal will then flee; [[animal]]s will try to run away, all other monsters will try to teleport away. Nymphs may cause you to take off a piece of armor, immobilizing you for several turns, and steal extra items for each turn you are immobilized. || only [[monkey]], [[nymph]]
|-
|AD_SEDU || [[Theft (attack)|Charming, stealing multiple items]] || No || No
| Currently the same as AD_SITM. The source calls this attack "seduction", but it is not the same damage type as the better known seduction type AD_SSEX. || only [[nymph]]
|-
|AD_TLPT || [[Teleport]]ing || Yes || Yes
| The target randomly teleports somewhere else on the level, subject to [[teleport control]], unless the level is no-teleport. || only [[quantum mechanic]]
|-
|AD_RUST || [[Rust]]ing || Yes || No
| Causes a random piece of worn armor to rust, which may fail if it is blessed, rustproof, or not rustable. As a passive attack, tries to rust the gear that made contact. Instakills [[iron golem]]s. || only [[gray ooze]], [[rust monster]]
|-
|AD_CONF || [[Confusion|Confusing]] || No || No
| Confuses the target. || only [[umber hulk]], [[Yeenoghu]]
|-
|AD_DGST || [[Digestion|Digesting]] || Yes {{footnote|Also is timed; if the timer runs out the damage is set to current HP.}} || No
| Only works when engulfing. Since monster engulfing is not implemented, when most monsters are digested, they will die instantly. || only [[trapper]], [[lurker above]], [[purple worm]]
|-
|AD_HEAL || [[Healing]] || Yes {{footnote|Only when wielding a weapon or wearing armor.}} || No
| Against monsters (always) and the player (in most situations), damage is converted to physical. However, if the player is naked and wielding no weapon, heals the player by 1d7 points, cures [[sickness]], and may increase maximum HP, exercise Strength, and exercise Constitution. This may cause the attacker to disappear or flee. Additionally, if the player is a [[Healer]], the attacker will never deal damage even if they have weapons and armor equipped. || only [[nurse]]
|-
|AD_WRAP || Wrapping / [[Drown]]ing || Yes || No
| If the target is not already stuck to the attacker, the attacker grabs or swings itself around the target, making the target stuck to the attacker like the AD_STCK effect. If the target was already stuck and the attacker is in water, the target is [[drown]]ed. Otherwise, the attacker is dealt crushing damage. This has no effect in monster-versus-monster combat. || [[eel]]s, [[kraken]], [[python]]
|-
|AD_WERE || [[Lycanthropy]] || Yes || Yes
| On monsters, this is just converted into physical damage. On the player, it inflicts lycanthropy. || only [[wererat]], [[werejackal]], [[werewolf]]
|-
|AD_DRDX || [[Poison]]ing that harms Dexterity || Yes || Yes
| Increased HP damage, lowers player's [[dexterity]], may instakill. Poison resistance negates all effects. || only [[quasit]]
|-
|AD_DRCO || [[Poison]]ing that harms Constitution || Yes || Yes
| Increased HP damage, lowers player's [[constitution]], may instakill. Poison resistance negates all effects. || only [[rabid rat]]
|-
|AD_DRIN || Draining intelligence || Yes || No
| Assumed to be tentacle brain-sucking by the code. No effect on headless monsters. Wearing a greased helm will apply the HP damage but no further effect; a non-greased helm will also do this 7/8 of the time. Should the attack succeed, the target's brains will be eaten; the player loses Int and suffers [[amnesia]], whereas monsters take an extra 1d10 damage.  || only [[mind flayer]], [[master mind flayer]]
|-
|AD_DISE || Causing [[disease]] || No || No
| The player is made (more) [[ill]]. No effect on monsters. || only [[Scorpius]], [[Juiblex]], [[Demogorgon]]
|-
|AD_DCAY || [[Rotting]] || Yes || No
| Attempts to rot a random piece of worn armor. As a passive attack, tries to rot the gear that made contact. Instakills [[wood golems]] and [[leather golems]]. || only [[brown pudding]]
|-
|AD_SSEX || Seducing || No || No
| For monsters, or if the SEDUCE system option is off, behaves identically to the AD_SITM and AD_SEDU item-stealing attacks. Otherwise, on the player only, initiates a [[seduction]] routine, which has various effects.{{footnote|According to code comments, the name stands for "succubus seduction (extended)", but that's probably just a convenient excuse.}} || only [[incubus]] and [[succubus]]
|-
|AD_HALU || [[Hallucinating]] || No || No
| Makes the player start [[hallucinating]]. Monster hallucination is not implemented, so monsters become confused instead. || only [[black light]]
|-
|AD_DETH || Death's special attack || Yes {{footnote|This attack will drain current and maximum HP at the same rate.}} || No
| Special attack: 15% chance of an instadeath unless you have player-style magic resistance, 30% chance of no effect, and 65% chance of dealing all of its damage to maximum HP in addition to current HP. || only [[Death]]
|-
|AD_PEST || Pestilence's special attack || Yes || No
| Special attack: is basically a disease attack that also deals its full complement of HP damage. || only [[Pestilence]]
|-
|AD_FAMN || Famine's special attack || Yes || No
| Special attack: makes you [[hunger|hungrier]] by 1d40 + 40 points unless you are fainted from lack of food, abuse Constitution, and also deal its full complement of HP damage. || only [[Famine]]
|-
|AD_SLIM || [[Sliming]] || Yes {{footnote|Only if the player is immune to sliming.}} || Yes
| If the target is already a green slime, incorporeal, flaming, or has [[unchanging]], it does not start to turn to slime; monsters will still take damage from this but not the player. Other monsters have a 25% chance of turning into a green slime instantly and a 75% chance of taking the damage with no further effect. The player will both take damage and start turning to slime with 10 turns to go. || only [[green slime]]
|-
|AD_ENCH || Disenchanting || Yes || Yes
| On the player, disenchant a piece of gear (if a passive attack, disenchant the gear that made contact.) Monster disenchanting is not implemented, so monsters just take it as physical damage. || only [[disenchanter]]
|-
|AD_CORR || [[Corroding]] items || Yes || No
| Attempts to corrode a random piece of worn armor. If a passive attack, attempt to corrode the gear that made contact. || only [[black pudding]]
|-
|AD_CLRC || Clerical spell || N/A || No
| Casts a random [[Monster spell#Clerical spells|clerical spell]] appropriate to the caster's level. No effect when the player is the attacker. || [[aligned priest]], [[high priest]], [[Master Kaen]]
|-
|AD_SPEL || Arcane spell || N/A || No
| Casts a random [[Monster spell#Mage spells|mage spell]] appropriate to the caster's level. The player can never cast monster spells, so it has no effect when the player is the attacker. || [[lich]], [[orc shaman]], [[Wizard of Yendor]]
|-
|AD_RBRE || Random [[breath weapon]] || N/A || N/A
| Not actually a damage type. When a monster attacks with AT_BREA and AD_RBRE (the Chromatic Dragon is currently the only such monster), it will set the damage type, and thus the type of breath, to a random damage type between AD_MAGM and AD_ACID. || only the [[Chromatic Dragon]]
|-
|AD_SAMU || Stealing the Amulet || Yes || No
| No effect on monsters at all. On the player, 5% chance of stealing a valuable item from inventory, otherwise no effect. Items are stolen in the preferred order of: any [[quest artifact]], the [[Amulet of Yendor]], the [[Bell of Opening]], the [[Book of the Dead]], and the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]]. || quest nemeses, demon lords, the [[Wizard of Yendor]]
|-
|AD_CURS || Stealing intrinsic || Yes || No
| If the attacker isn't a gremlin or it isn't [[night]], no additional effect. On the player, attempts to remove a random intrinsic. On monsters, 10% of the time, attempts to cancel the monster. Instakills [[clay golem]]s if the attack hits, including when the player is one. || only [[gremlin]]

&&%s&& %s Bug Hall of Fame {149798 2023-01-19T17:04:24Z {4000867 K2} /* Vanilla NetHack */ 3.7.0 hall of fame bug Sometimes, [[bug]]s appear in NetHack or a variant that break the game in a completely ludicrous way. Such bugs are preserved here for posterity.

Commonly accepted characteristics of Hall of Fame bugs include:
* The gameplay implications of the bug are hilarious in the context of normal play.
* If a "silliness mode" were added to the game, the bug would be re-implemented for the sake of having it in that mode.

== Vanilla NetHack ==
* The Vorpal Exploit: The game did not correctly re-roll the d20 it uses when calculating whether a thrown weapon will hit, meaning that the to-hit roll of a thrown weapon would always be the same until the player took some other action to reroll the die (such as making a melee attack). [[Vorpal Blade]] also uses the to-hit roll to decide whether it makes a decapitation attack. Together, this allowed the player to melee with Vorpal Blade until getting a decapitation, after which all attacks made by throwing Vorpal Blade would have a guaranteed decapitation, until the next melee attack. Once discovered, this bug was also found to exist in all NetHack variants, including SLASH'EM. In GruntHack, the bug works the same way with weapons that have the vorpal [[object property]].
* NetHack 3.1.0 had a "ludicrous bug" where [[Yeenoghu]]'s confusion attack would fall through due to a missing break statement, causing it to run the code that handles Death's melee attack. This allowed Yeenoghu to instakill players without magic resistance and drain maximum HP with his melee attacks. This bug went unreported for three major versions of the game because of a misplaced source code comment that made it look like intended behavior. It was removed in 3.4.0.
* Branchport skip: In NetHack 3.4.3, the player could skip most of the ascension run with the Eye of the Aethiopica, because the branchporting code did not care if their mount was carrying the amulet. The character could drop the amulet, then wait until their pet would pick it up, then quickly mount it and invoke branchporting to sokoban or the mines. The pet would drop the amulet again after a few turns.
* Time distortion bug: In NetHack 3.4.3, the code handling sinking into lava would treat ''any'' command (even something simple such as checking the inventory) as though it cost time. This was bug C343-231.
* Amulet delivery service: In Nethack 3.4.3, covetous monsters (for example, [[Asmodeus]]) would teleport to the High Priest of Moloch in [[Moloch's Sanctum]], fight and kill them, pick up the Amulet of Yendor, and then teleport back to you. Players would bring a strong covetous monster to the sanctum on purpose and let it fetch the amulet for them. This reduced the time spent in Moloch's Sanctum to about 40 turns, without the character ever having to move away from the upstairs and only having to fight a single monster. This was spoiler bug SC343-19.
* From at least [[3.1.0]] until [[3.6.6]], a monster using [[Stormbringer]]'s [[drain life]] attack on another monster would result in healing the player instead of the attacker.  Many variants inherited this bug.
* NetHack [[3.7.0]] editlevel 67 through 69 (developmental versions), the vibrating square did not generate, but Moloch's Sanctum could be reached via the stairs without meeting any of the normal requirements, allowing an alternative method of completing the game.

== NetHack 4 ==
* Generalized Sting: A mistake in the new string-handling code caused all attempts to name an item with an artifact name to be accidentally sent down the [[Sting]]/[[Orcrist]] codepath, meaning that if the player had an item with the same base type as an artifact and gave it the same name, they'd create the artifact.
* [[AC]] was changed to Defence, a quantity starting at 0 and increasing. However, when the player's stats were zeroed, the Defence stat was never changed from the default zero. Unfortunately, Defence is stored on the AC scale internally, so the "0" in the player's stat array would actually be interpreted as 0 AC, i.e. 10 Def.
* Tame demons gated in hostile ones when they attacked, causing a lot of grief for players with demon pets.
* Unquitting: if you managed to hang the game while in its post-game state (which is not hard to do), the game would get confused and revert the quit, allowing you to continue to play as if you had saved instead of quitting. With the DYWYPI information, this allowed the player to get free identification, enlightenment, conducts, et cetera, on demand with no impact to the game.

== dNetHack ==
* The originally-deployed version of dNetHack did not correctly handle to-hit bonuses during melee combat.  This caused the player's to-hit modifier to increase or decrease by a few points every time they attacked in melee, eventually rolling over from -128 to +127.  As a result, during dNetHack's first Junethack outing players experienced runs of 'bad luck' during which their characters were unable to hit targets in melee, followed by runs of 'good luck' during which they couldn't miss.
* Also during dNethack's original Junethack outing, ranged monster spellcasting was implemented in the middle of the tournament due to the author's mistaken belief that it was present in vanilla NetHack, and therefore its absence in dNetHack was due to a bug.

== FIQHack ==
* For almost 2 years, monsters in FIQHack regenerated HP twice as fast as the player, rather than being equally fast. Given how fast players regenerate HP lategame (before FIQHack addressed HP regeneration rate later on), this could get a bit out of hand.
* It used to be possible for samurai player monsters on the samurai quest to read scrolls of genocide and instantly kill the player.
* At one time, reading a non-blessed scroll of earth would cause an infinite number of boulders to fall on you.
* A bug resulting from a reworking of code handling branch connections made it possible to end up in Home:0 by digging down from the Quest goal level. The game ended up reading Mines level data as Quest filler, and unless the player had already generated the Mines, would generate Quest filler in place of it. Continuing upwards to Home:-1 and beyond would, if the player hadn't visited the Mines' top level, eventually overwrite Gehennom data, including the Sanctum, replacing it with Quest filler. If it was possible to skip generating the Sanctum this way and generate what the game considered to be the VS level, as Quest filler, you could then enter Gehennom properly (by branchporting for example) and skip the invocation by going to the VS (replaced with Quest filler) and taking the downstairs there.
* It used to be possible to access the Sanctum before doing the invocation by falling past the Vibrating Square dungeon level.

== NetHack Fourk ==
* Bones levels from dungeon level 20 or later in the main dungeon could erroneously be saved as being from dungeon level 2. Then, new adventurers could load these bones when they entered dungeon level 2.
* Player speed was completely broken for a while: on each turn, you would get faster and faster with each turn, until you would have around 9 turns of free movement on the 10th turn. But every 11th turn, you would become paralyzed for 11 turns.
* Natural HP regeneration was somehow removed for all characters.
* Artifacts in inventory blasted you twice whenever something checked your inventory.
* The blessed [[scroll of wishing]] allowed you to wish for wands with 127 charges in the normal game (this was intended to be possible only in wizard mode).

== UnNetHack ==
* The Bell of Opening could fail to generate, making the game unwinnable.

== SLASH'EM ==
* It's possible to enchant a weapon to +127 by [[polypile|polymorphing]] it into a [[dwarvish mattock]], [[upgrade|upgrading]] it to a [[pick-axe]], further polymorphing it into a [[tinning kit]] or an [[expensive camera]], [[charging]] that tool until it has 127 charges, and then waiting for it to revert.  A +127 [[long sword]] can then be turned into [[Excalibur]], while a +127 [[bow]] or other [[launcher]] can fire 40 or more projectiles at once.
* [[Pit#Buried objects|Burying]] a [[medical kit]] and then waiting for it to rot leaves behind the pills it contained, which can then be consumed for a chance of a [[wish]].  An average medical kit contains about 10 pills, while the wish chance is {{frac|1|7}}, so it's possible to farm wishes by repeatedly wishing for medical kits.

== SLASH'EM Extended ==
* The version deployed during [[Junethack]] 2016 had a bug where most sources of healing, when used on the player, would have a 50% chance of unconditionally healing the player back to full HP. This included the very common scroll of healing, making the game much easier when the player had a high max HP.
* In some old version it used to be possible to get two Amulets of Yendor due to two different boss monsters on Moloch's sanctum both being generated with one. If the player picked up both, then dropped one, level teleportation became possible again, allowing the player to skip the entire ascension run if they wanted. And to top it off, Rodney would not harass the player anymore either.

== SLASHTHEM ==
* Artifacts with the "protection" effect, e.g. the Burned Moth Relay, would give 2 extra points of AC every time the player saved and reloaded. This allowed the player to reach a naked AC of -128, and on the next save it would roll over to +126 (-128, +127, +126).

== AceHack MP ==
* AceHack's multiplayer mode would teleport a character to an otherwise inaccessible "waiting room" area above the top Sokoban level on save. When a player restored the game again, the character would be teleported to their old location. Note that this was a literal teleport - if the character was in a shop carrying unpaid items, the shopkeeper would consider it a theft and would be angry when the game was restored.

== Splicehack ==
* There was a time when using < on the starting upstair would count as ascending the game, making it trivial to get turn 1 ascensions even outside of wizard mode. Several players on the hardfought public server snatched "ascensions" that way.
* When infernals were first added to SpliceHack, all humans treated them as hostile. This caused quest leaders to immediately expel an infernal player when talked to, making it impossible to win as an infernal.

== EvilHack ==
* In one version, the [[vibrating square]] did not generate, but [[Moloch's Sanctum]] could be reached via a simple [[level teleport]] without  meeting any of the normal requirements, allowing an alternative method of completing the game.
* Pets who knew "cancellation" would cast it repeatedly at the player, making it impossible for the player to maintain intrinsic protection, and eventually ruining their inventory.

== Other ==
* In [[objects.c]], the base AC of armor is unintuitively expressed as the value your AC would be if you wore it with no other armor (e.g. plate mail's AC is coded as 3 because it gives -7 to AC, and 10 - 7 = 3). When the [[devnull]] tournament added the Waldo Challenge, it added bobble hats which were intended to be useless armor which was only there for flavor. However, it was given an AC of 0 in objects.c, likely because whoever implemented it didn't know that base AC counts down from 10. The effect was that a +0 bobble hat granted 10 AC when worn.

==Description==
Monsters have energy (Pw), just like players do. They gain or lose Pw as they level up, in an approximation of the player formula:

* Start with a minimum: 0 for dwarves; 2 for nymphs, humans, gnomes, and dedicated casters (see below); 3 for elves and dragons; or 1 for everyone else.
* Add a random number between 0 and Wisdom/2 + 1 (+ 1 for dedicated casters).
** Monster Wisdom - before any helm of brilliance's effects - is 20 for the Wizard of Yendor, 18 for dedicated casters, and 11 otherwise.
* Multiply the result by: 1/2 for mindless creatures; 3/4 for Barbarians, Valkyries, and animals; 3/2 for healers and knights; 2 for Priests, Wizards, and dedicated casters; or 5/2 for the Wizard of Yendor.

Spellcasting failure chances use [[Spellcasting#Calculating_spell_success_rate|the vanilla formula]] with these values:

 Who                 Base   Emergency   Shield   Suit   Stat
  Wizard of Yendor      1          -3        1     10    Int
  nurses                8          -3        1     10    Int
  dedicated casters     3          -1        1     10    Int
  everyone else         8          -1        1     10    Int

Monsters always use their intelligence with casting (their Intelligence - before any helm of brilliance's effects - is always 20 for the Wizard of Yendor, 18 for dedicated casters, or 11 for everyone else). In addition, monsters represented by an [[A]] don't get the normal penalty to casting from using a large shield.

Whenever a monster is generated, it is assigned a list of spells. This is done by selecting among the spells with equal probability for each of them - potentially rolling the same spell more than once - a certain number of times: 10 + rn2(XL+5) for dedicated casters, rn2(XL/3) for everyone else. This spell is then added to the monster's spell roster with a probability of (2 + Spell level + Skill level) / 6. Skill level is 0 (unskilled), 1 (basic), 2 (skilled), or 3 (expert). In addition, monsters with at least Basic skill in attack spells are guaranteed [[force bolt]].

Some monsters, mainly uniques, but also some additional ones, are generated with a fixed spell list. Those are listed below.

== Dedicated casters ==
FIQHack has a flag for monsters that count as "dedicated casters". Those mostly (but not quite) align with monsters that could spellcast in vanilla.

'''xNetHack''' is a [[variant]] of [[NetHack 3.7.0]]'s development version, developed by aosdict, aka [[User:Phol ende wodan|Phol ende wodan]].

Its main goals are:
# Fix game balance issues.
# Eliminate tedious and frustrating parts of the game.
# Make uninteresting things more diverse, unique, and varied.
# Experiment with new ideas from the community.

It is not intended to be a "kitchen-sink variant" &mdash; the main focus is on enhancing and deepening the existing systems in the game, rather than adding lots of new objects, monsters, and roles willy-nilly.

It is intended to keep up with the development version of vanilla NetHack, and will regularly merge in its latest commits. It has also drawn inspiration from [[SpliceHack]], [[EvilHack]], [[NetHack Fourk]], [[GruntHack]], SliceHack, and various patches from the 3.4.3 era.

Version 7.0 of xNetHack is currently released and is available to play on the [[hardfought]] public server:
* US server: ssh nethack@hardfought.org, or play in-browser at https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/hterm-us/
* EU server: ssh nethack@eu.hardfought.org, or play in-browser at https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/hterm-eu/
* AU server: ssh nethack@au.hardfought.org, or play in-browser at https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/hterm-au/
The hardfought hterm also supports the tiles version of xNetHack, and it is the recommended method if you want to play with tiles. Select the "xNetHack" tileset and the "Square" font.

For players who wish to play xNetHack locally on Windows, the .exe files are located in the GitHub release files under "xnethack_mswindows.zip". [https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack/releases/tag/xnh7.0 Here is the most recent release.]

xNetHack's source can be found [https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack on Github], should you want to compile it yourself. It also has an [[IRC]] channel for game discussion and support: #xnethack on [https://libera.chat irc.libera.chat] (and it is also on-topic in the #hardfought channel).

This page is the least frequently updated source of new information about xNetHack; the changelogs are updated more often, and the commit messages are guaranteed to be totally up-to-date.

==Common pitfalls==
Some changes in xNetHack will cause massive annoyance to anyone who assumed that something worked just like vanilla and played the game accordingly. To try and prevent this, here is a list of such changes:
* '''Some monster letters are changed up'''. In particular, for genocide purposes, '''mind flayers are now U, not h'''. See {{sa|Monster recoloration and letter rearrangement|sectionsign=true}} for complete details.
* The {{sa|Object materials}} patch works mostly like GruntHack, with one very important variation: '''you cannot wish for object materials unless in wizard mode'''. Don't start planning out wishes as if you're going to get +5 dragonhide everything and a silver Excalibur.
* '''There is no more spell of identify'''. To compensate, scrolls of identify are much more reliable, and the number of identifications they give depends only on their beatitude, with no random factor.
* Orcish Town is still a mostly hostile, challenging place, but Izchak is still alive, and all the armor, weapons, spellbooks, and other shop loot you would normally have found in Frontier Town is lying around on the ground for free. Therefore, '''don't quit just because Orcish Town generated'''.
* '''The artifact wishing formula has been changed'''. It depends only on the number of artifact wishes you have already made, so getting gifted artifacts, finding random or bones artifacts, or naming Sting doesn't count against you. But the odds are harsher; only your first artifact wish is guaranteed.
* '''Wishes have been spread around Gehennom rather than all being at the Castle'''. The Castle now contains only two guaranteed wishes, with other single wishes being found at Vlad's, the Wizard, one of the fake towers, and in the northeasternmost room of the Sanctum. Furthermore, '''wands of wishing turn to dust when they hit 0 charges and cannot be recharged''', so don't use your first wish on charging scrolls unless you have something else you want to charge.
* '''Watch out for {{sa|Artifact changes|artifact changes}}'''. In particular, '''the Sceptre of Might is now the Priest quest artifact''', '''the Mitre of Holiness is removed''', '''the Orb of Detection is replaced by Itlachiayaque''', and '''the Orb of Fate is replaced by Sol Valtiva.'''
* '''Dragon-scaled armor replaces dragon scale mail.''' This is described below in more detail, but the main takeaway is '''do not read enchant armor while wearing only scales unless you wish to become a dragon.'''

== Frustration and tedium removals ==
