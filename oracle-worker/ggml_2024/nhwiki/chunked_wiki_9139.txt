&&%s&& %s Alignment quest {147003 2022-07-26T15:38:34Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* SLASH'EM */ The '''alignment quests''' are a set of three alignment-themed quests found in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNetHack]]. The inclusion of alignment quests in dNetHack was inspired by the alignment quests in SLASH'EM, but the quests themselves are quite different. In both variants, the quests yield [[alignment key]]s and alignment artifacts.

==Common properties==
The quests all share some common properties in both variants:
*They are all accessed by portals found in the main dungeon; two alignment quest portals will never be found on the same level, nor on the same level as the main [[quest]].
*Unlike role-based quests, they are single-level branches and have no [[quest leader]]s or [[quest guardian]]s.
*There is no alignment-based restriction - rather, a specific alignment key is found in each one, and neither they nor the alignment quest artifacts can be [[wish]]ed for; the wish will be wasted as if you wished for your own quest artifact. ("For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!")

==SLASH'EM==
In SLASH'EM, portals to each quest are found between levels 15 and 19. Each quest has only one floor with a unique, [[covetous]] enemy that must be killed to retrieve their alignment key; each unique enemy will be surrounded by minions of similar type and/or alignment, and will also drop a unique artifact if killed in a manner that normally leaves a corpse (i.e. everything outside of [[disintegration]] and [[digestion]]). The alignment keys are used to open the central six doors in the top level of [[Vlad's Tower]], which have been made indestructible in SLASH'EM. Because of the configuration of the doors, you will always need at least two of the keys (and thus two completed quests) to reach Vlad.

However, it is still possible to obtain the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]] without the alignment keys. There are two main ways to do this:
*Wake up Vlad yourself: Similar to waking up the Wizard, one can do this with a charged [[drum of earthquake]] or a polyselfed or pet [[mind flayer]]'s psychic blast. Vlad is [[covetous]], and so will teleport to meet the player.
*Let somebody else do your dirty work, specifically the [[Wizard of Yendor]]: he wants the Candelabrum as much as you do, and so will teleport to meet Vlad if you lure him up to the top level of Vlad's Tower. However, he cannot get past Vlad's [[Need +x weapon to hit|+3 enchantment resistance]], but he will at least wake him up for you. Alternately, filling the area with pets via a combination of [[create monster]] and confused [[taming]], or by simply spamming [[flame sphere]] or a similar spell, it's possible for a pet to end up next to Vlad and wake him up.

===Chaotic===
The [[Chaotic Quest]] sees you fighting [[Vecna]] for [[Hand of Vecna|his Hand]] and the [[Key of Chaos]]. He is surrounded by an army of undead ({{white|L}}, {{white|V}}, {{white|W}} and {{white|Z}}) and has a very high base level himself, making the Chaotic Quest the hardest of the alignment quests. It is also the most rewarding of the three, given that the level also contains a large number of chests, scrolls and spellbooks. Be aware that the portal might take you right next to Vecna himself, so be prepared with a means of creating a permanent [[Elbereth]].

===Neutral===
The easiest quest but also the least rewarding, the [[Neutral Quest]] is filled mostly with [[gas spore]]s and a few random monsters, with the [[Beholder (SLASH'EM)|Beholder]] guarding the [[Key of Neutrality]] at the end. Be sure to have magic resistance, reflection, or a source of blindness before entering the level, and be mindful of the fact that the Beholder has the same glyph as his "attendant" gas spores. A ranged weapon is also advisable, although it is not an absolute necessity for a strong character. The reward, the [[Eye of the Beholder]], is not terribly useful overall in comparison to the others.

===Lawful===
The [[Lawful Quest]] is designed vaguely like something out of a horror movie, and is filled with numerous "illusions" - deceptively #named objects made to look like useful items or artifacts, doors which lead nowhere, a false temple, and more. Beneath its illusions, it does always contain a coaligned altar and [[cursed]] [[enchantment|-9]] [[gray dragon scales]], and you have a chance to find an [[amulet of flying]] as well - you will likely have to fight an arch-lich to obtain the scales, however, making [[stoning]] very handy here; you can [[cancel]] the scales to uncurse them and zero out their enchantment. The quest nemesis, [[Nightmare]], inflicts surprising amounts of damage but is otherwise unremarkable. She drops the moderately useful [[Nighthorn]] and the [[Key of Law]] when killed.

==dNetHack==
In dNetHack, the alignment quests now have dedicated branch levels that are multiple floors long and divided into roughly three parts; portals to each are found between dungeon levels 12 and 20. Multiple unique creatures serve as guardians for each quest, and all contain multiple artifacts related to the theme of the quest, most of which are associated with one of the unique enemies.

The quests each have three alignment keys associated with them, but the precise means of obtaining the keys varies between quests. The keys are required for the three doors in the [[Valley of the Dead]]; they have been made indestructible in dNetHack, and each requires an alignment key to open. Any alignment key can be used to open any of these doors, but the key is destroyed in the process, and three of the nine total alignment keys are needed for access to [[Gehennom]]. Note that it is impossible to level teleport past the Valley in dNetHack before descending into Gehennom via the Valley stairs. This means you need to either fully complete a specific alignment's quests or partially complete any combination of multiple alignment quests.

=== Chaos ===
There are now three versions of the [[Chaos Quest (dNethack)|Chaos Quest]].
* The first version is a tribute to the original ''Final Fantasy'', and sees you descending through [[Chaos Temple Quest|the Temple of Chaos]]. The unique quest enemies are the [[Nightmare]], [[Sir Garland]], the [[Black Knight]]s, [[Warmachine]], the [[four fiends]], and the demon [[Chaos]].
* The second version builds on [[Mithardir Quest|Mithardir]] in the D&D Forgotten Realms. 
* The third version builds on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Lord of the Rings'' with a [[Mordor Ruins Quest|quest to the ruins of Mordor]].

=== Neutral ===
The [[Neutral Quest (dNethack)|Neutral Quest]] is a hybrid quest inspired by D&D and the Cthulhu Mythos, and sees you traveling across the Outlands, and then descending through the Lethe Waterway and the Gulf of N'Kai. The latter portion of the Neutral Quest is based on the [[Lethe patch]]. The unique quest enemies are the [[Center of All]], [[argentum golem]]s, the [[Alhoon]]s, and [[Great Cthulhu]]. The Outlands portion of the quest contains a branch to the [[Shrouded dispensary]], where [[Illurien of the Myriad Glimpses]] can be found. There are also numerous [[Map inclusion (dNethack)|map inclusions]] that are eligible for generation in the Outlands portion of the Neutral Quest, some of which contain unique artifacts.

=== Law ===
The [[Law quest (dNethack)|Law Quest]] is inspired by D&D, and sees you traveling up through the Paths of Law, across the woodlands of Arcadia, and then ascending a fortress and tower (note that the quest branches into two paths here). The unique quest enemies are [[Auton#Axus|Axus]], the [[Arsenal]], and Lady [[Oona]]. In dNethack 3.16.1 and later, there are also numerous [[Map inclusion (dNethack)|map inclusions]] that are eligible for generation in the Paths of Law and Arcadia woodlands portions of the Law Quest.

The alignment keys are artifact [[skeleton key]]s found at the end of the [[alignment quest]]s in [[SLASH'EM]]. They are all [[intelligent]] but otherwise have no special properties. Wishing for any of them is not allowed ("For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!").

==Opening the doors in Vlad's Tower==
The main purpose of the alignment keys is to open the artifact doors in Vlad's Tower.  To reach Vlad himself, two of the three keys (any two) are needed.  However, as mentioned in the [[alignment quest#Necessity|alignment quest]] article, this is not absolutely necessary to obtain the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]].

==Usefulness otherwise==
In [[SLASH'EM]], [[unlocking tool]]s can break, whereas these artifact keys never will( they can corrode and rust however).  Therefore, one's own alignment key is ultimately a very useful item to have, and even a cross-aligned key can be useful to open a chest without risking breaking its contents, although one will sustain up to 8d10 [[artifact blast|blasting]] damage for every use.

==Bug==
They can be put into containers, including a [[bag of holding]], and if such a bag of holding blows up, the artifact key is lost forever and the game also often throws a "indestructible object free" error message. If more than one of the keys is destroyed this way and the doors on Vlad's tower are not yet unlocked, winning the game requires the player to use one of the alternate strategies to wake up Vlad.

The '''wand of draining''' is a new wand introduced in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNethack]].  Similar to a [[spellbook of drain life]], it casts an unreflectable beam which drains a level from its target monster. Like the spellbook, it also drains enchantment (one point at a time) from armor and weapons, and charges from rings, wands, and chargeable tools.

==Identification==
This wand has the same effect as the [[spellbook of drain life]], and will self-identify if this effect is seen.  When engraved with, if there is a pre-existing message, it will erase part, or possibly all, of it.  This generally produces the message '''"The engraving looks different now"''' which is shared with the [[wand of polymorph]] in [[SLASH'EM]]; however, reading the message will clearly differentiate between the two, as the wand of polymorph produces random, very recognizable rumors.  If the pre-existing engraving is sufficiently short, the wand will instead give a message about the engraving disappearing; to avoid this ambiguity with the [[Wand of cancellation|other]] [[wand of teleportation|wands]] that [[wand of make invisible|do that]], dust-engrave moderately long messages (6 letters is enough) before engrave-testing unidentified wands.

==Monster use==
Unfortunately, monsters know how to use these wands all too well.  The beam cannot be [[reflection|reflected]], and [[magic resistance]] provides no protection against it.  Monsters are content to empty these wands on you, quite possibly killing you from level drain, and at the very least leaving you considerably weaker.  They will very preferentially use these wands against you, it seems.  If the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#The Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers|Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers]] is generated in [[SLASH'EM]], expect to see large numbers of player monsters carrying these.

In [[dNethack]], these wands are much, much rarer than the ones in [[SLASH'EM]] to the point that the player may have difficulty obtaining one, thus vastly reducing their threat (But they are still possibly dangerous; [[Binder_(role_in_dNethack)|Binders]] can accidentally unbind [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Roles/Binder/Numina|Numina]]). Most players get by without obtaining drain resistance.

==Protection==
The only protection against these wands is [[drain resistance]].  This is a rather obscure property in vanilla nethack that becomes a vital part of an ascension kit in [[SLASH'EM]], mostly due to this wand.  It is provided from the following sources:
===SLASH'EM===
*Wearing an [[amulet of drain resistance]].
*Wearing [[deep dragon scales]] or [[deep dragon scale mail]].
*Wielding [[Excalibur]], [[Stormbringer]], or the [[Hand of Vecna]]; note that the [[Staff of Aesculapius]] does ''not'' protect against life drain in [[SLASH'EM]] any longer.{{refsrc|artilist.h|350|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}
*Having it intrinsically, either from [[polymorph]] or being a [[Lycanthrope (starting race)|lycanthrope]], [[Vampire (starting race)|vampire]], [[undead slayer]] or [[necromancer]].
For those who don't mind the potential loss of a level, it is sufficient to have the amulet in open inventory, ready to be replaced when a monster begins attacking with a wand of draining.  You will possibly lose two levels in the two turns it takes to remove the current amulet and put the amulet of draining on, but be able to regain one level almost instantly.  A [[very fast]] monster, such as a [[quickling]] or [[fire vampire]], with a wand of draining could inflict even more lost levels, although luckily such monsters are relatively rare.  The [[Hand of Vecna]] provides drain resistance when wielded, although since it is itself a poor weapon, one will have to find another way to kill the draining monster, or wait for it to run out of charges.  One might also try carrying Excalibur or Stormbringer as a backup weapon.

Those who do not have a means of protection would be well-advised to pick up and/or stash any wands of draining they find.

===dNethack===
Generally, drain resistance is not necessary as a full-time equipped item, as wands of draining have an abysmal drop rate. However, there are still some situations in which it's necessary or helpful, such as when fighting [[Auton#Axus|Axus]] in the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Dungeon_of_Ill-Regard|Library of Law]]. It can be obtained by:
*Wielding Vampire Killer, Release from Care, The Lifehunt Scythe, The Silence Glaive, Stormbringer, Lolth's Fang, Liecleaver, Durin's Axe, Arcor Kerym, Aryvelahr Kerym, or The Rod of Seven Parts.
*Wearing Soulmirror, The Claws of the Revenancer, or Chromatic Dragon Scales.
*Carrying the Lance of Longinus, Sunbeam, Moonbeam, Veil of Latona, The Cloak of the Consort, The Heart of Ahriman, or The Iron Ball of Liberation.
*Wearing an [[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack_Items#Amulets|amulet of drain resistance]], [[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack_Items#Helms_with_randomized_appearances|helm of drain resistance]], or [[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack_Items#Body_armor|black dragon scale mail]]/[[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack_Items#Shields|shield]].
*Eating an amulet of drain resistance (100% chance to obtain the intrinsic, but only for 1000 turns.)

The '''amulet of drain resistance''' is a new amulet in [[SLASH'EM]] which provides [[drain resistance]], as is provided in vanilla nethack only by wielding [[Stormbringer]], [[Excalibur]] or the [[Staff of Aesculapius]], the last of which no longer provides the intrinsic in SLASH'EM.

==Strategy==
Due mainly to [[wand of draining|wands of draining]], drain resistance becomes important in SLASH'EM's late game.  The amulet of drain resistance is a very good choice for fulfilling this, at least for those who would otherwise wear an [[amulet of life saving]] or an [[amulet of flying]].  Be aware that a fast monster may be able to drain 2 (or possibly even more) levels from you before you can replace your amulet, resulting in a loss of level that cannot be immediately undone.

Don't bother trying to eat them hoping to acquire [[intrinsic]] drain resistance, as it is impossible and merely wastes the amulet.

The '''juggernaut''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].  It sports an incredibly high base level, and can dish out large amounts of damage.  However, it is somewhat slow, and lacks any special abilities or resistances.  By the time it appears, it is not a huge threat, and any character who lacks the AC to stand up to its attacks can easily take it out with ranged weapons.

A '''silver mace''' is a type of blunt [[weapon]] found in [[SporkHack]] and [[SLASH'EM]].

It shares all properties with the ordinary [[mace]], save that it is made of [[silver]] and therefore inherently [[fooproof]].

==SLASH'EM==
In SLASH'EM, it appears randomly, but does not exist as an artifact. In this variant, its weight increases by 6.

==SporkHack==
In SporkHack, silver maces are never generated randomly, but serve as the base item for [[Demonbane]], which is the only [[artifact]] silver mace; it is possible to [[wish]] for a regular silver mace. The weapon's weight is the same as the ordinary [[mace]] (30).

:I believe that only applies to the text, rather than images. I'd argue if it allows submitting pretty much any images at all it can't have that clause, and it allows porting them over from other sites.

&&%s&& %s Borrow {68546 2011-02-05T18:30:20Z {25 AileTheAlien}  {{stub}}
The #'''borrow''' command is an [[extended command]] unique to [[SLASH'EM]]. As the name implies, it attempts to "borrow" - or more specifically, steal - gold from a nearby monster of the player's choice.

== Mechanics ==
When borrowing, you will attempt to steal up to 25-50 times your experience level gold from the monster.

You obviously must have hands to steal, and your encumbrance must be less than strained. There must be a monster at the square you specify, but it is not necessary for you to be able to detect the monster. If the monster is not tame there is only a chance of success.

Your chance of success is based on your dexterity and if you are a rogue or not. There is no benefit from polymorphing into a monster that is able to steal items through attacks, e.g. a [[nymph]] or [[leprechaun]]. The base chance of success is 5%, plus your level times 2 if you are a rogue. Your dexterity bonus is your dexterity minus 10 if below 10, your dexterity minus 14 if above 14, and 0 otherwise. This bonus is multiplied by 3 if you are a rogue and is added to your chance. There are penalties based on the gloves, shield, and body armor you are wearing:

Shield: -10 if wearing any shield

Gloves: +5 if no gloves, +0 for gauntlets of dexterity, -5 for any other gloves

body armor: Based on weight. No armor is +0
:base is +10 at wt<75. Every 50 units above this is -5, to a maximum penalty at 375 units (-25)

The chance is finally restricted to between 5% and 95%. Failing to steal from a peaceful monster will anger it. Successfully stealing from a non-tame monster will also [[exercise]] dexterity.

== Messages ==
'''You failed to steal anything.'''

You used the #borrow command on a target, but failed the success roll.

'''I don't see anybody to rob there!'''

You used the #borrow command on a space that didn't have a monster.

'''You search around but don't find anything.'''

You attempted to #borrow while engulfed.

'''You don't find anything to steal.'''

The monster did not have any gold to steal.

'''Mirrorbright''' is an [[artifact]] [[shield of reflection]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[dNetHack]]. When worn, it provides [[hallucination]] resistance in a manner similar to [[Grayswandir]] alongside the usual [[reflection]].

==SLASH'EM==
In SLASH'EM, Mirrorbright is [[neutral]] for [[wishing]] purposes, and is the first [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Healer]]s.

===Strategy===
As a shield of reflection, Mirrorbright can be a useful early gift for neutral characters, but its hallucination resistance is only marginally useful in the early game, and is almost completely superseded by a well-enchanted [[unicorn horn]]. While Mirrorbright makes reflection more available, characters with early wishes have little reason to select it over a normal shield of reflection.

In addition, wearing Mirrorbright still gives spellcasting penalties even to Healers, forcing them to remove it when they want to heal and limiting its use in combat situations. As their first sacrifice gift, it will also be more difficult for Healers to obtain an [[artifact weapon]] afterword that can compensate for their generally low hitting power.

==dNetHack==
In dNetHack, Mirrorbright is a chaotic bronze [[roundshield]] that can be enchanted to +7, and has an additional #[[invoke]] effect that toggles [[conflict]].

[[Skullcrusher]] is a [[SLASH'EM]]-specific [[lawful]] artifact [[club]].  It is the first sacrifice gift for [[caveman|cave(wo)men]], and deals an extra 10 damage to all monsters, as well as having a +3 to-hit bonus.

==Strategy==
While not as overpowered as the [[Bat from Hell|other role-specific club in SLASH'EM]], Skullcrusher is still a significant boon for cavemen.  It makes the early game a breeze, and is a usable weapon even through SLASH'EM's late game.  In terms of damage, it is only slightly worse than [[Excalibur]] or [[Snickersnee]], particularly when considering highly enchanted weapons.  In short, it is a reliable, usable, if not particularly extraordinary weapon throughout all of SLASH'EM.  It is probably not worth an artifact wish though, particularly since any role that could use it could also use the more powerful [[Bat from Hell]].

'''Doomblade''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]], [[SlashTHEM]] and [[SpliceHack]]. It is [[chaotic]], and its [[base item]] is an [[orcish short sword]].

Doomblade deals +10 damage versus all monsters, with a {{frac|4}} chance of dealing an extra (1d4 * 5) damage every attack; this bonus damage is accompanied by a message when it triggers. The bonus chance still occurs even if you are [[twoweapon]]ing with Doomblade in the off-hand, which is allowed in SLASH'EM.

==Strategy==
Though not seen or sought out as often as other artifacts in SLASH'EM, Doomblade is actually one of the better weapons in the game - its extra damage averages out to +13, which is comparable with [[Skullcrusher]] as well as [[Excalibur]] and [[Snickersnee]] (though to a lesser degree). While the average damage of +5d4 vs +1d4 * 5 is the same (12.5 per proc, or 3.125 per attack), the damage output distribution of the latter is much "swingier": where a roll of 5d4 will cluster around 12.5, a roll of 1d4 * 5 will take a value of 5, 10, 15 or 20, all with equal probability. The bonus damage rolls are fairly frequent, allowing Doomblade to finish off difficult or well-armored monsters, and it remains more than viable well into the SLASH'EM end game even if you do not get the bonus damage as often.

Unlike most artifacts, Doomblade lacks a [[to-hit]], making using it while [[unskilled]] and/or at a low [[experience level]] somewhat more difficult; for high-level characters, the difference is negligible. Players who cannot effectively use the [[Bat from Hell]] due to being restricted in [[club]] skill may find this a worthwhile artifact weapon wish, as might those who want a suitably powerful offhand weapon.

The '''Curses interface''' is an alternate text-mode [[User_interface|interface]] for NetHack using high-level [[wikipedia:curses_(programming_library)|curses]] routines to control the display.  The curses interface has additional features compared to the traditional tty interface, such as dynamic window resizing, dynamic configurable placement of status and message windows, and mouse support.


==Features==

Some features of this interface compared to the traditional tty interface include:

* Dynamic window resizing (e.g. maximizing a terminal window)
* Dynamic configurable placement of status and message windows, relative to the map
* Makes better use of larger and smaller terminal windows, such as a multi-line message window if there is space
* Optional mouse support (click to move player, etc)
* Menu text search/selection 
* Fancier display (e.g. window borders, optional popup dialogs, splash screen, and better menus)
* Improved keyboard navigation of menus
* "cursesgraphics" option for fancier line-drawing characters for drawing the dungeon&mdash;this should work on most terminals and platforms
* Ability to have a permanent inventory sidebar by enabling <tt>perm_invent</tt>

==Public servers==
[[nethack.alt.org]] currently hosts [[NetHack 3.6.6]], which has the curses interface enabled as an alternative to the standard [[ASCII]] interface.

[[NetHack 4]] and its derivatives [[NetHack Fourk]] and [[FIQHack]], as well as [[DynaHack]] use the curses interface by default; any server which hosts these variants supports it.

[[Hardfought]] offers the curses interface for almost every variant hosted, save for [[NetHack 1.3d]], [[Slash'EM]], [[SlashTHEM]] and [[ZapM]].

==Configuration options==

Some configuration [[option]]s that are specific to or relevant to the curses windowport are shown below.

{|class="prettytable striped"
|<tt>OPTIONS=windowtype:curses</tt>
|'''Use this to enable curses interface''', if the binary was compiled with multiple window interfaces, and curses is not the default.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=IBMgraphics
OPTIONS=symset:IBMgraphics</tt>
|Set this for Windows systems, or for PDCurses for SDL on any system. The latter uses a cp437 font, which works with this option. Use the symset form on 3.6.x.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=cursesgraphics
OPTIONS=symset:curses</tt>
|Set this if IBMgraphics above won't work for your system. Mutually exclusive with the above option, and should work on nearly any system.  Use the symset form on 3.6.x.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=align_message:bottom
OPTIONS=align_status:right</tt>
|Optionally specify the alignment of the message and status windows relative to the map window.  If not specified, the code will default to the locations used in the tty interface: message window on top, and status window on bottom.  Placing either of these on the right or left really only works well for wider terminal windows.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=popup_dialog</tt>
|Use a small popup "window" for short prompts, e.g. "Really save?".
If this is not set, the message window will be used for these as is done for the tty interface.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=term_cols:110
OPTIONS=term_rows:32</tt>
|Specify the initial window size for NetHack in units of characters.
This is supported on PDCurses for SDL as well as PDCurses for Windows.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=windowborders:2</tt>
|Controls the usage of window borders for the main NetHack windows (message, map, and status windows).

A value of 0 forces the borders to be off, a value of 1 forces them to be drawn, and a value of 2 allows the code to decide if they should be drawn based on the size of the terminal window.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=splash_screen</tt>
|Whether or not to display a fancy ascii-graphics splash screen on startup.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=petattr:u</tt>
|This controls what text attributes are used to highlight any pets. Any combination of single letters representing each text attribute may be used.  Not all attributes work on all terminals.

Attributes may be one or more of: '''B'''old, '''I'''nverse, '''U'''nderline, blin'''K''', i'''T'''alic, '''R'''ightline, or '''L'''eftline.  The default is underline.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=guicolor</tt>
|Controls whether color and attributes are used for menu headers, window borders, message text, etc.  This is separate from the color option, which only controls the color of the map itself.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=mouse_support</tt>
|Use the mouse for moving around. This option defaults to false.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=perm_invent</tt>
|Show a permanent inventory window as a sidebar.
|-
|<tt>OPTIONS=classic_status</tt>
|Whether to use a 2-line status display akin to tty display (TRUE), or a 3-line status bar similar to the one NetHack4 and its variants has (FALSE).  On NetHack 3.x, classic_status defaults to TRUE.  This option is currently ignored in NetHack 3.6.x.

A '''tin foil hat''' is a new [[Randomized appearance|appearance]] for unidentified [[helm]]s in [[SporkHack]], as well as a new non-randomized helm in [[UnNetHack]]. 

The tin foil hat protects the wearer from damage from a (master) [[mind flayer]]'s psychic blast, with the downside that it also prevents the wearer from sensing monsters by [[telepathy]].  This applies to any active source of telepathy the player has&mdash;including, in SporkHack, the helm itself, if it happens to be the random appearance of the [[helm of telepathy]].  This means that in any game in SporkHack, there is a possibility that you will not be able to count on a helm of telepathy being an effective source of ESP for your [[ascension kit]].

In UnNetHack, the tin foil hat is [[weight]]less and made of [[metal]] (which does not [[Erosion|rust or corrode]]), and, like the [[dented pot]], does not require a full [[turn]] to [[wear]] if the player is [[fast]].  However, it does not contribute to the wearer's [[AC]], giving it little value apart from its psychic protection.  With a base price of only one [[zorkmid]], surplus tin foil hats are probably not even worth saving for the next [[shop]] you encounter.
{{clear}}

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Tin foil hat}}

Tin foil hats are head coverings made from aluminum ("tin") foil, which (supposedly) protect against attempts (by government organizations, spies, extraterrestrials, etc.) to read or control the wearer's mind.  The theory is that the foil functions as a [[Wikipedia:Faraday cage|Faraday cage]], a device that prevents electromagnetic waves from entering a space, in this case the wearer's brain.  In practice, however, foil wrapped around the head does not make an effective Faraday cage.  (Real Faraday cages are made by sufficiently enclosing spaces with metal sheets or grids.)

Because of the questionable theories behind them, tin foil hats are stereotypically associated with conspiracy theories and paranoia, which gives the phrase "tin foil hat" a generally negative connotation.  Some communities have "redeemed" the concept, though, with tongue-in-cheek tin foil hat design contests.

Shadow wolves are slightly slower and weaker versions of [[mist wolf|mist wolves]]. They can be a threat if you lack [[cold resistance]], but are otherwise unremarkable for when they appear.

Both spells are level 1 matter spells in SLASH'EM that are deferred features in [[vanilla]], and both will summon the appropriate type of [[sphere]]. 

==Differences from regular pets==
The major difference between a regular pet and a spell being is that the kills of a spell being are considered your kills, much as if you cast a spell at the monster directly. Non-fatal attacks will anger peaceful monsters. Fatal attacks on a peaceful monster will carry the potential alignment and murder penalties associated with killing the monster directly. This is especially problematic, as the two normal spell beings are mindless and will therefore attack anything that isn't tame they encounter, including shop keepers and priests. Beware the ring of conflict, as spell beings will attack other pets, and if they kill them will give you the penalty.

Another minor difference is that spell beings are immune to [[Pet_(SLASH'EM)#Treachery|treachery]].

===Polymorph===
Spell beings are not immune to polymorph. The polymorphed monster will retain the experience and blame transference characteristic of unpolymorphed spell beings. It is extremely easy to create an army of polymorphed spell beings using a polymorph trap due to the low level of the spellbooks; simply use a magic whistle to cycle the sphere in the trap until good forms appear. This can be used to quickly gain experience levels by obtaining an army of powerful pets. The one-time use of the flame sphere and freeze sphere is characteristic of the spheres themselves, not spell beings, so the polymorphed pet will stick around significantly longer as well.

== The path to ascension ==

I haven't gotten THAT far yet, been playing for about a month now, and the furthest I've gotten to is Dlevel 22 with a lvl14 Babarian. (I just found out yesterday how to use the #enhance command. No I am not joking, I actually played about 50 hours without knowing how to raise my skills).



Alright, basically, could someone give me a slight guide to the Dungeons? Like, you start in the DoD and around level 3-5 you can go to the GM, there is the big room in between... etc.

Just a general guide as to where you go through ever since you begin the game, until ascension.

: As always, the answer's "it depends". I tend to go to Minetown as early as possible to buy protection before leveling up too much, but many others do Sokoban first and so on. The article about [[Standard strategy]] might be a start. Also [[Wizard|some roles']] quests are easy and gain you much so should be done early, whereas others are [[Barbarian|mostly useless]] and best delayed, so best read the article dealing with your role. Also helpful: a [[map]] in ASCII, and a hand-drawn one: http://modcult.org/image/150  --[[Special:Contributions/62.80.22.186|62.80.22.186]] 10:54, September 14, 2010 (UTC)

== Keeping a pet ==

What would you say is best? Having a tame Large dog/Cat/Warhorse, no pet, or pet monster?


I find keeping a Dog/Cat to be more trouble than it's worth. First, they attack peacefuls and creatures you'd rather keep alive. They also eat bodies you'd possibly like to eat (floating eyes, normal bodies when you're hungry, etc).

They also kill shopkeepers, priests and guards in Minetown.

They get lost constantly, and you have to keep going back to get them before you go down a level.

A leash is annoying as it keeps the pet too close to you and can interfere in several situations.

They can trigger some awful traps which can hurt even you.

And they can even turn feral if you're not careful.



Now, the only upside of keeping a standard pet, is the BUC identification, and some help when fighting (usually they don't, the end up chasing a grid bug when 5 trolls are rushing you). Oh, and stealing from shops, though that's limited (they can't get big stuff), and there are other ways to steal anyway.



So the question is, is it worth it keeping a pet? Especially at low level?

Or should you dump the pet and tame a decent monster?

: In a non-conduct game, keep the pet until you are sure you can survive without, then abandon it. As a pacifist, your life depends on your pets. Keep 3-4 of them, and shove them on a polytrap to improve them before you go much farther down than say dungeon level 10. It pays off to learn the art of luring pets, and [[credit cloning]].[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 18:04, September 14, 2010 (UTC)
: Also, a [[magic whistle]] massively cuts down on the problem of having to go back to get pets, and is useful for keeping them away from peacefuls you want alive (although other than the minetown priest and (sometimes) shopkeepers, it doesn't really matter if they wipe out peaceful monsters).  As for which pet is best, by far warhorses: they're fast, have a higher level than dogs/cats, and don't eat desirable corpses other than lichens.  The downside is that you have to keep them fed on vegan food, but there's usually enough of that in the dungeon. -[[User:Ion frigate|Ion frigate]] 22:00, September 14, 2010 (UTC)
::Each stage of the game its pet choice. Warhorses are good before you find a polytrap, but they die very quickly in Gehennom. 
[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 04:48, September 15, 2010 (UTC)
:::Yes, I should have been clearer; I meant of the starting pets/easily tameable ones (i.e. cats, dogs, horses), warhorses are the best. -[[User:Ion frigate|Ion frigate]] 06:48, September 15, 2010 (UTC)

== Rogue ranged preference ==

What is the prefered ranged choice for Rogues?

Daggers are my usual choice, as the rogue can level up the Dagger skill quite quickly, but I was wondering whether there are any alternatives. Like, besides carrying daggers, you could carry a crossbow with poisoned bolts? Because I generally think melee should be avoided when playing a Rogue, unless you have a crazy enchanted main artifact.

What are your opinions?

:Daggers are probably best: they're plentiful, relatively damaging, and they are never destroyed on impact.  If you want to go for a poisoned weapon, go for darts instead.  You can get a lot of them out of dart traps, whereas bolts are often quite hard to find, and the damage gained from them isn't that much.  Also, not having to switch weapons when monsters get within melee range (and they will) can be a lifesaver, particularly against fast monsters.
:As for melee with rogues, they can always get [[Stormbringer]], either from crowning or sacrifice.  Combined with skilled proficiency in broadswords, it's pretty deadly and for my rogues eventually becomes their main weapon.  But in the early game, yes, melee is better avoided if possible. -[[User:Ion frigate|Ion frigate]] 17:10, September 19, 2010 (UTC)

== Trapped in Sokoban ==

Oh boy. I'm in quite a mess. I'm playing a lvl 10 Knight, and I'm currently stuck on the first level of Sokoban. How? I completely forgot that the two scrolls there are Earth scrolls, and the boulders trapped me in a corner. I tried jumping away with no sucess. I also removed all my clothing and dropped everything and tried to fit through, nothing. I had a wand of magic missile but it's out of charges. I have a wand of lightning but it doesn't destroy boulders. I tried praying, but it was too early and he was displeased.



Now, I think the only way to get out of here, is to pray, but I'm unsure whether my god can do anything about it. I can post my inventory if you'd like, but I don't think I have anything that can get me out of there. Right now, I think I should just wait and try to pray later. I have a few food rations that should make me last for quite a while.

What can I do otherwise?



EDIT: Nevermind, YASD. I prayed, and he teleported me near the entrance, sorrounded with monster. I killed most of them, but they backed me against the wall, and since I had used most of my items trying to escape, I had no way to survive... Except jumping, which I only remembered I could do just after I got killed. Oh well.

== Advice on how to proceed ==

So, this is the farthest I've ever gone, so I'm going to take it nice and slow.

Lvl 12 Barbarian, Chaotic. Intrinsics: Poison, Shock, Cold, Speed, Telepathy.

125hp. Wielding a +5 two handed sword. Wearing +0 crystal plate mail, +0 high boots, +0 leather gloves. AC is 0. Plus I'm wearing an amulet of reflection (I had better equipment but... polymorph trap :/

Got a wand of death and a a few others, a couple of scrolls of teleportation, a ring of teleport control (wearing it) and like 6 unidentified rings.



Now the question is, should I go further down? I'm in dlevel 23. Can I take on what's down there? I think I should probably go up and try and get some better armor, but there's nothing in Minetown... I haven't done Sokoban and Mine's end, maybe I should do those first and hope to find something good?

What do you guys think?



'''Edit:''' Thanks for the tips. If you're wondering how it went down, I basically finished Sokoban and the mines, where I found nothing decent, only a +1 blessed ring of protection. So I proceeded carefully, killed Medusa for the first time (she stoned herself) but it all went downhill from there. I wanted to start double wielding, and found a broadsword on her level, and well, it was cursed, and -2. I went around a couple of levels looking for scrolls of remove curse, blessed potions of water, or altars, nothing. I prayed here and there, but with no success. I managed to enter the castle in the end, but soon got stomped by a minotaur.I was used prayer to heal and bashed him some more, but he wouldn't die (I was hitting him with a cursed -2 broadsword, after all) and I managed to escape barely, with about 13 HP, where two fire ants trapped me and finished me off.

Still, it's the furthest I've ever gone, and I've learned some good lessons from it. And besides, it was fun :) Thanks again.


:If you can handle d23, then you can definitely finish Mine's End and Sokoban. You already have reflection so the Sokoban final reward might be redundant, but even the items all over the lower floors may be useful. Just watch for more poly traps in the lower levels.
:Your biggest priority should be magic resistance. Try to find a kill a gray dragon for the scales. Your AC also needs to be lowered; DSM will help with that. Try to secure some enchant armor scrolls and bless them. Also, get a cloak. Elven cloaks are the best that can be easily obtained; you'll need MC3, especially if you switch to DSM. Check the wiki for how to get DSM; reverse genocide is usually the best. Stand on burned Elbereth and you;ll be fine, since you have reflection. -- [[User:Qazmlpok|Qazmlpok]] 15:20, September 22, 2010 (UTC)

So...I have acquired all three artifacts to open the Sanctum and found the vibrating square. I applied the candelabrum and it lit giving off a powerful light, I applied the bell but "it didn't make any sound." Then I read the book of the dead...but "something is wrong" and lots of monsters appeared. None of the items were cursed. What is going wrong? Does a Bell need a charge? I have looked for other answers but am not coming up with any other answers. Any help?
:Yes, the bell of opening needs to have at least one charge. You'll need to find a scroll of charging and use it on the bell. Also, make sure you snuff the candles on the candelabrum so they don't burn out while you get the scroll. -- [[User:Qazmlpok|Qazmlpok]] 11:58, October 4, 2010 (UTC)

== Innvocation Problems ==

Some help, please? I’m trying to complete my first ascension and I am close enough to taste it, maybe that’s my problem. I have collected all of the invocation artifacts and found the vibrating square. I put the candles on and lit them. Then I applied the bell “but there is no sound.” Then I read the book …”something is wrong “ and a mass of creatures appear. None of artifacts were cursed. I am wondering what I am doing wrong? It is the bell, does it need charges?

Also, after doing this twice and finally killing all of the creatures and Rodney, now the Book of the Dead is cursed and I have no means to uncurse it. Any suggestions?
:As above, yeah it's the bell that need[ed] a charge.  Now, to uncurse the Book; do you still have the Castle wand of wishing?  Cursed items are a problem that can be wished away; just wish for a 2 blessed [[scroll of remove curse|scrolls of remove curse]] or 2 potions of [[holy water]].  The latter is probably the better choice, since you can use it to make more of the same (dilute potions twice, dip stacks of water in the holy water).  Make sure to make more before using it to uncurse the book.
:If you don't have any wishes left, you might be able to write a scroll of remove curse with a magic marker.  Unless you're a [[luck]]y wizard, this will fail at least 2/3 of the time if you haven't identified the scroll.  However, a fully-charged magic marker will, on average, be able to write at least one scroll of remove curse as long as you've maxed out your luck (if you haven't, do that now... see [[luck]] for how).  Make sure the scroll you're writing on is uncursed, wield the book, and read the scroll.  Other options include dipping it in a fountain repeatedly (until the water "glows for a moment"), zapping it with a wand of cancellation, an occasional effect from praying at altars, learning and casting [[spellbook of remove curse|remove curse]], or wielding the book and repeatedly stepping on a [[magic trap]].
:Whatever you do, do it quickly; the wizard is going to be harassing you every few hundred turns, and fighting him and his summoned minions repeatedly can bring down even a high-level character.  Try to zap him with a [[wand of death]] every time he appears. -[[User:Ion frigate|Ion frigate]] 19:56, October 5, 2010 (UTC)

== Ascending with my original dog/intellgent pet advice ==

I currently have a level 21 invisable fast dog and I am a level 30 tourist. I got the dog past the level 9 threshhold through cursed scrolls of genocide and I've fed him potions of extra and fullhealing when I've found them. I am plalying slashem. I am on level 32 and I am am attempting to beat the game with my original dog. I have tried this before but Gehennon does me in. Also can give my dog any other intrinics other than speed and invisablity? Any advice on how to make it through the whole game with my original dog?

Also I have a watch captain as a pet. I polymorphed her into and charmed her with a harp. When she reverted back to human form she stayed charmed. First, is this the only way to tame a human? Second, is there anyway to get her to put on rings and amulets? What about using wands?]

Lastly I want to know whether something is a bug. My dog got caught in a polymorph trap when he was level 15. When he reverted to dog form he was level 9 ie the maximum level for a dog without wraith corpses. Also potions of gain level don't affect pets. Is this a bug and if not is there what is the logic for this?

:You can't give it any further intrinsics; pets that will wear armor or wield weapons can be given reflection and magic resistance, as well as some other resistances from artifact weapons. No monster in nethack or SLASH'EM will put on rings, and the only amulets they will wear are reflection and life-saving.
:As for the level-reversion, looking at [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/timeout.c#line599]], there doesn't seem to be any reference to the monster's level; I'm guessing that whoever wrote that just didn't want to keep track of the monster's level as well. Potions of gain level should affect pets, however, up to a maximum of 49. That doesn't help for pets which won't drink potions, of course.
:And if you want to keep your dog alive through the whole game, you can:
**Play very carefully - I imagine that keeping a particular dog alive through the whole game is probably significantly easier than a [[pacifist]] ascension, for example; you just have to watch out for monsters such as [[crystal golem]]s and [[black dragon]]s which can one-shot it. A [[wand of teleportation]], [[wand of healing|wand of (extra) healing]] and [[magic whistle]] would all greatly assist in keeping it alive.
**Polymorph it into stronger forms. Make sure you use [[polytrap]]s to do this, as the wand or spell has a chance to kill it outright. In addition to having a more survivable form, it also has a "second chance" if it's killed, as it will just revert to its original form. The downside is this only lasts 1000 or so turns per polytrap, and they may not be spaced correctly for that.
**If you have a bag of holding (or better the [[Wallet of Perseus]]) and a slightly loose definition of "alive through the whole game", you could stone it, carry the statue, and stone-to-flesh and retame it at the altar.
:But also note that leveling your dog up is actually likely to decrease its ultimate chance for survival: pets won't attack things more than a level higher than them without conflict, meaning a dog in the endgame isn't going to attack that much. Monsters will never actively attack pets without conflict; they always attack as a response. A high-level dog is likely to get itself killed, as its attacks don't scale with its level. No monster better demonstrates this than the [[Oracle]]; she will wipe out any domestic animal foolish enough to attack her (and I've seen her take down [[deva]]s even). -[[User:Ion frigate|Ion frigate]] 09:24, October 31, 2010 (UTC)
:
:I've considered the stoning apporach but I'd rather not. I've been throwing the potions of gain experience on my pets. which I thought would have the same affect (it does with extra and full healing) but has no affect. The reason I've been avoiding polying the dog "Ragnar" is he reverts to level 9 when he becomes a dog again. I'll hand my watch captain a amulet of life saving. One more question how does a humanoid determine what armour or weapons it will wield. I enchanted a silver sabre to +5 assuming she would wield it. She wielded it for a cou-ple levels and now has dropped it in favor of a regular long sword.
:thans for the help
::Two things to add;
::Hitting a pet with a potion of (extra/full) healing will heal it, but will not increase maximum hit points like it does with you. Additionally, potions of restore ability and gain ability have the same effect, and all potions like this have the same effect: a potion of healing will heal for the same amount that a potion of full healing will. Also, if you wield the potion and hit them with it, it counts as abuse and lowers tameness (although this isn't a big issue for a carnivorous dog).
::Invisibility has no effect on pets. None. Monsters never need to 'see' your pet as they only counter-attack, and invisibility doesn't grant a to-hit penalty in this situation either. -- [[User:Qazmlpok|Qazmlpok]] 13:46, October 31, 2010 (UTC)
::
::In Slashem I have noticed the max hp actually does go up.  I believe by 4 for each full healing. potion.  I don't know about vanila nethack

He died while polymorphed and reverted to being a tame necromancer.

== Identifying Potions and Scrolls without Pricing ==

My current strategy for identifying items early on is just to quaff potions and read scrolls immediately.  That way if they're detrimental I haven't lost much in the way of time or equipment, and if they're beneficial I have an early identification of them for later in the game.  Obviously this method can be suicidal at times, and it doesn't always work.  Potions in particular pose a problem, as not all of them can be quaff ID'd easily; I think there are like three of them that taste like slime mold juice.

The obvious solution would be to price ID them, but I've only been playing for about a week now, so I'm not experienced enough to do that just yet.  So what methods should I use to identify these items as safely as possible, and as early as possible?

[[User:Henshin|Henshin]] 21:53, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

: You can try to {{kbd|a}}pply a new potion to test for [[oil]]. If you find an item on a monster's corpse and you [[death drop|did not kill it yourself]], name it something like "purple moninvent" because only a [[offensive item|small]] [[defensive item|subset]] [[misc item|of objects]] can be generated on monsters. [[Nymph]]s often carry [[object detection]]. That's about all you can say safely.
: Using unknown scrolls and potions is a pretty bad idea. There are some outright dangerous ones, and generally it's a waste of resources. I recommend you learn [[price identification]]. There are [http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/shopping.html#real-tables pre-made price tables].

Unlike most other conducts, you must enable the [[Options#blind|blind]] option in your [[configuration file]] with the following line in order for your game to qualify. This makes you permanently blind without requiring other sources of blindness.
 OPTIONS=blind

NetHack does not actually use the term "zen" anywhere; it refers to the conduct as '''blind from birth'''. 

Even when you are permanently blind, you are able to read (or at least "turn the pages of") the [[Book of the Dead]], since otherwise it would not be possible to win the game, similar to how reading it does not break [[illiterate]] conduct.

==Strategy==
The difficulty in zen lies in the fact that you cannot identify the appearance and [[beatitude]] of most objects, and they are only shown as their object class - all potions are only shown as "a potion", wands as "a wand", etc. The exception to this is your starting inventory, which you always start with knowledge of. You cannot read scrolls while blind unless you learn their labels, e.g. buying scrolls from shopkeepers will have them name the labels for you. You also cannot use [[altar]]s to find the [[BUC]] status of an object, because you cannot see if the objects glow and in what color. 

===Early game===
Exploration will be slow and tedious, especially in the early game. Moving blindly will anger a peaceful creature if you attempt to walk onto their square without seeing them, even when using the safe-move function {{kbd|m}}. A lawful or neutral zen player should be especially careful of committing accidental or intentional murder.

Players are recommended to use the [[search]] command with almost every step at least. This will be the only way to get any sort of warning of an approaching monster, and it will speed up the "mapping" of the level as the search command will check each adjacent square for walls, items, or creatures, while just moving will only check the square you're about to step on. If you know (or reasonably suspect) there is a wall, then walk into it; walking into a wall tile will reveal it on the map without using up a turn.

A player's primary goal will be to acquire a source of telepathy as soon as possible - the most commonplace and likely source of telepathy is a [[floating eye]], which will begin appearing when the average of the player's dungeon level and experience level is roughly 3.<!-- integer division cuts off any fractional parts--> Players seeking a floating eye should not proceed much farther beyond the dungeon floors most likely to generate one - a [[Wizard]] fortunate enough to start with the [[detect monsters]] spell will have a much easier time locating an eye, but the rest will be forced to rely (appropriately) on blind luck. 

Players can also obtain telepathy via prayer with at least 6 [[Luck]], a [[helm of telepathy]] or an [[amulet of ESP]], but getting enough Luck without a [[luckstone]] is challenging in the early game, and the other two items are not particularly common.

===Pets===
It is advisable for a zen player to start without a pet, also set via the options file. A pet is extremely difficult to keep track of and distinguish from hostile monsters in the early game, and the player runs a serious risk of killing them accidentally. An alternative is to quickly ditch a starting pet on DL1 and proceeding into the dungeon, returning to re-tame the pet when telepathy is acquired. In either case, a zen player should eventually acquire a pet to identify the BUC status of items. 

===Object appearances===
For information on how you can see objects while blind, see [[Blindness#Discovering objects|the article section on object appearances]], which contains a full list of ways to make an object "seen" without breaking the conduct. Most notably, a blessed [[potion of object detection]], which can be dropped by a nymph, will identify all items in your inventory, containers and the map. If the farlook command {{kbd|;}} does not tell you the appearance of an object even though you should know it, the object is buried or carried by a monster, or has since been moved away.

Be careful not to eat [[zombie]] corpses, and keep an eye out for critical messages in this regard when fighting monster - you "destroy" zombies, but "kill" living enemies. Zombies also cannot be seen via telepathy.

===Shopkeepers===
Shops are important for identifying the appearance of large numbers of items, especially scrolls and potions. A container to place the items in and a pet to steal the container back will speed up the process of re-acquiring items you've just sold to the shopkeeper for identification.

The [[pay]] command only works if you can see the [[shopkeeper]], either by [[telepathy]] or [[monster detection]], or if he is angry. Alternatively, you may drop enough gold to cover your purchase and then teleport, jump or phase out, even without [[teleport control]]. The practical result of this is that a player will typically have no way to get an item out of a shop until [[telepathy]] is acquired. Bumping into a shopkeeper will anger them, even when using the {{kbd|m}} command; since this will nearly always result in death, a zen player is best advised to simply avoid shops until they can properly use them.

Selling items works as normal, which might be useful if you get burdened before acquiring telepathy.

===Late game===
Prioritize the genocide of [[green slime]]s before entering [[Gehennom]], because they cannot be seen while blind.

Water or lava tiles cannot be identified while levitating, so be careful on water levels such as [[Medusa level]] and use magic mapping if possible.

Do not step on a [[cockatrice]] corpse while not wearing gloves.

'''Do NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to wear the [[Eyes of the Overworld]] in a zen game.''' Putting them on will produce the message ''"For the first time in your life, you can see!"'' and break the conduct. They are the only thing in the game that can do this. Because the Eyes only provide effects when worn, they aren't even worth carrying around.

==Notable ascensions==
Only a handful of people are known to have ascended zen games, and most of them have been zen [[samurai]]. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/1f508de3da1c4ed3/3f67dccf081db600?lnk=st this post to RGRN] announces the first known ascended zen [[tourist]]. [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/msg/83ba3b23689d60dc?hl=en Jo&atilde;o Santos] is the only person known to have completed zen ascensions in all four pre-3.6.0 roles able to do zen. A [[Unofficial_conduct#Nudist|nudist]] zen ranger [http://un.nethack.nu/user/boxo/dumps/boxo.1341391449.txt.html has been ascended] in [[UnNetHack]], which allows all roles to try zen.

A complete Zen Samurai ascension can be watched [http://www.codehappy.net/nethacktheatre/zen.ttyrec.gz here] in [[ttyrec]] format.

A video of a complete Zen [[Nudist]] Valkyrie ascension from 2019 [[TNNT]] can be watched [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZEdecBa4A here].

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, players had to set their own rules and use several workarounds, such as wearing [[blindfold]]s or permanently polymorphing into blind monsters. Only [[Samurai]], [[Rogue]]s, Wizards, and [[Tourist]]s can start with a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]], which typically required a little [[start scumming]], and even then you would be momentarily non-blind for a short time at the beginning to blind yourself.

===NetHack 3.4.3 specific strategy===
Generally, a Samurai is considered the easiest role for 3.4.3 zen conduct due to their good starting armor and strong melee combat skills, which are important in the early parts of the game. A Wizard can start with several helpful items for the early game as well, such as a [[wand of fire]] or [[wand of lightning|lightning]] for partially reliable engraving of [[Elbereth]], or a [[ring of warning]]. The Rogue and Tourist are going to have a more difficult time, due to weaker melee skills and a lack of strong starting gear.

A zen game is ''flawed'' if a nymph or monkey steals your blinding item and you immediately put on another one, without looking at your inventory. Should this happen, be careful not to use the [[#name]] or {{kbd|i}} commands, since these will reveal object appearances in your inventory.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Zen}}
The conduct is named for a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty. Zen Buddhism emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation, and a direct understanding of "natures", specifically the "nature of mind" and the "nature of things", and encourages the expression of these insights for the benefit of others in daily life:

 The Dharma is the truth that all natures are pure. By this 
 truth, all appearances are empty... The buddha is your own 
 mind... As long as mortals are attached to appearances, 
 they're unaware that their minds are empty. And by mistakenly 
 clinging to the appearance of things they lose the Way.
  -Bodhidharma

Zen conduct in ''NetHack'' focuses more on the "detachment from appearances" tenet of the above.

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
[[UnNetHack]] adds functionality that allows players to optionally select certain conducts at the start of the game, tracks them, and punishes players for breaking them. If the player selects Zen Conduct, they begin the game wearing a cursed blindfold, that, if ever removed, breaks the conduct and summons some monsters around the player. To use the Book of the Dead, you can #[[invoke]] it.

===NetHack 4===
[[NetHack 4]] offers a "permablind" option that gives blindness as an [[intrinsic]], overriding any attempt to remove it. Like UnNetHack, #invoke also allows use of the Book of the Dead. The conduct cannot be broken by the Eyes of the Overworld, because they no longer grant astral vision.

A '''recluse spider''' is a monster added in [[SLASH'EM]].

==Biology==

A real family of poisonous spiders. Most of them are unremarkable. But the bite of some species can cause a nasty necrotic skin lesion taking months to heal or more rarely being even deadly.

==Encyclopedia Entry==

{{encyclopedia|	Eight legged creature capable of spinning webs to trap prey.

	"You mean you eat flies?" gasped Wilbur.
	"Certainly.  Flies, bugs, grasshoppers, choice beetles,
	moths, butterflies, tasty cockroaches, gnats, midges, daddy
	longlegs, centipedes, mosquitoes, crickets - anything that is
	careless enough to get caught in my web.  I have to live,
	don't I?"
	"Why, yes, of course," said Wilbur.

&&%s&& %s Phase spider {144189 2022-01-19T08:01:58Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Encyclopedia entry */ The '''phase spider''' is a monster that appears in some [[variant]]s.

==Origin==
Phase spiders are borrowed from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

The ''D&D'' incarnation resembles a large white spider with dark green patterns, and a humanoid head with two eyes. It's an ambush predator, phasing from a parallel dimension to surprise its prey, hence the name.

===Encyclopedia entry===

{{encyclopedia|	Phase potion, which is related to oil of etherealness, is more useful for general combat. When imbibed, this potion allows the user to shift in and out of phase with the Prime Material plane at will, much like a phase spider. When out of phase, the user is impervious to all forms of attack except those that reach into Ethereal plane. ... Phase potions are brewed from phase-spider ichor or from the concentrated juices of rare underground fungi.
		[ RPG Sheets by Amalor Mymnyx ]

Phase Spiders are not true Spiders, but an alien race which appear as giant spiders with humanoid shaped heads. Phase Spiders speak a whispery language which is reminiscent of the sound of the wind blowing through the trees. ... Phase Spiders are considered Enlightened creatures as they have the ability to phase in and out of our normal space-time into what most scientists would refer to as Void-Space. Phase Spiders use this ability to their great advantage in combat.
