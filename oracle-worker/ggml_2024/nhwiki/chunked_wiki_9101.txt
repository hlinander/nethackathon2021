== Uncursing items ==

If you have multiple cursed items causing you trouble, they will be uncursed in the following order:

=== Major troubles ===
# Levitation boots
# Ring of levitation (left hand)
# Ring of levitation (right hand)
# Two-handed weapon, or one-handed weapon while wearing a cursed shield
# Blindfold or towel
=== Minor troubles ===
# Gauntlets of fumbling
# Fumble boots
# Loadstone, if ''strained'' or worse
# One-handed weapon, if wearing a ring on your right hand<ref>The code specifies two-handed weapons here too, but as a major trouble that should have been fixed already. ([[pray.c#line217]])</ref>
# Gloves

A '''maze''' level is a type of level found in the floors before the [[Castle]] and in [[Gehennom]]. As the name states, it is set up like a maze, with narrow passages and dead-ends. There are zero, one, or two [[minotaur]]s, {{monsym|minotaur}}, generated on each [[maze]] level.{{refsrc|mkmaze.c|639}}

Generated mazes usually contain passages bounded by the [[wall]] terrain. Beginning in [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the walls of mazes may actually be composed of [[solid rock]]. In such mazes, the floor is [[corridor]] rather than regular floor terrain. The maze may only be one square wide, or may have wider corridors.

==Strategy==
Some form of [[magic mapping]] is a good idea when in a maze. Maze walls are often [[dig]]gable, so a [[wand of digging]] or [[pick-axe]] can be handy to navigate and to make a clearer path between the [[stairs]]. Note that digging beams from a [[wand of digging]] will only dig a single space in maze levels, but strategic use of them can make your wands last longer.

==History==
"Maze"-type levels appeared as far back as [[Rogue (game)|Rogue]], although not in any set location.

==UnNetHack==
In [[UnNetHack]], [[mimic]]s found on a maze level are more likely to mimic a statue than a mimic found elsewhere in the dungeon.

Its main features are [[Geek]] as a new [[role]], and various monsters and jokes borrowed from the works of [[Douglas Adams]].

The documentation also describes a feature that allows players to reroll new characters. They may even specify minimum features! This is normally something that [[we]] expect of [[Angband]], not [[NetHack]]. It also contained lots of new items such as the [[scroll of consecration]] that built an [[altar]] on the current square (with the odds of the altar being co-aligned depending on the scroll's BUC), the [[scroll of undo genocide]] which re-enables generation of a particular monster, [[scroll of reverse identify]] that lets you identify a type of item (e.g. ring of conflict – "Ring of conflict is twisted ring") or an appearance (e.g. "Bubbly potion is restore ability"), [[wand of wonder]] which duplicates the effect of zapping a random wand, [[potion of radium]] which makes you very sick, and [[potion of cyanide]] which makes you very dead.

NetHack TNG was also the source of [[Schroedinger's Cat]] though it behaved differently. It had a 50/50 chance of a potion of radium, potion of cyanide, and a live cat or a potion of radium and a dead cat.

NetHack TNG has become obscure, as apparently no one has bothered to port it to newer versions of [[vanilla]] NetHack. Though Sebastian Klein's original distribution site is missing, [[J. Ali Harlow]] offers NetHack TNG (in the form of a [[patch]] from the 3.1.3 sources) on his [http://www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/TNG.html archive site].

However, TNG seems to be more popular among Japanese players. Apparently TNG was ported to [[JNetHack]], resulting in "JNetHack-3.4.3-0.8-TNG".

Large parts of NetHack TNG have been ported to [[SLASHTHEM]].

Anglophones have noticed NetHack TNG back when Edrobot was using it as a vehicle to put Douglas Adams jokes into [[Dudley's dungeon]]. The story arc began at [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20070424 24 April 2007]; NetHack TNG became a plot twist at [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20070501 1 May 2007].

&&%s&& %s Douglas Adams {149419 2022-12-16T23:59:59Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} small tweak to desc., add vogons {{wikipedia|Douglas Adams}}
'''Douglas Adams''' (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English author, screenwriter, essayist, humorist, satirist and dramatist. Adams is best known as the author of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', a work of science fiction comedy which originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy and developed into a "trilogy" of five books that sold more than 15 million copies in his lifetime and generated several adaptations. These stories chronicle the adventures of one Arthur Dent, thought to be the last survivor of the Earth's destruction by a Vogon constructor that was making way for a hyperspace bypass - he is rescued by Ford Prefect, a humanoid alien writer for the in-universe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the pair travel around the galaxy.

In ''[[NetHack]]'', there are a few scattered references to ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', with the most primary one being the [[towel]], a multipurpose [[tool]]. While not as ridiculously useful as in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'', it still has various relevant applications: among them are [[blind]]ing yourself, wiping glop or grease off your person, removing [[engraving]]s on the floor, and [[wet]]ting the towel to whip at monsters. The [[Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal]] and the [[microscopic space fleet]] are two [[hallucinatory monster]]s that originated in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' as well - additionally, Douglas Adams is the reason for [[throne]]s disappearing in a "puff of logic", with the phrase coming from an aside in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' where Oolon Colluphid uses the Babel Fish argument to convince God that He doesn't exist, and God "promptly vanishes in a puff of logic."

==Influence on variants==
In 1994, [[Sebastian Klein]] released [[NetHack: The Next Generation]], a [[variant]] of [[NetHack 3.1.3]] that draws much more heavily from the works of Douglas Adams and adapts them to the [[w:c:hitchhikers:Whole Sort of General Mish Mash|Whole Sort of General Mish Mash]] that is the variant's geek culture influence. Various monsters derived from or inspired by his works are added to the game, with the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal and microscopic space fleet being "upgraded" to actual monsters in the process.

NetHack: The Next Generation also includes a special tribute level dedicated to Douglas Adams and ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' as a whole; Douglas Adams himself [[Douglas Adams (monster)|appears as a monster]] that can be encountered here, and the level is populated with various Adams-inspired monsters as well.

[[SlashTHEM]], a more recent variant based on [[SLASH'EM]] and another SLASH'EM fork called [[Slash'EM Extended]], incorporates all of the aforementioned monsters, levels and features from NetHack: The Next Generation.

==List of Douglas Adams-inspired features in variants==

&&%s&& %s Rnz {149230 2022-12-09T05:58:57Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* Cumulative distribution function */ fill in integration constants.  I probably did it correctly since it all adds up to 1 at the end. {{DISPLAYTITLE:rnz}}
{{randomvariable|name=rnz(x)|graph=Rnz100.svg|caption=[[wikipedia:Probability density function|Probability density function]] of a call of rnz(100).|distribution=unique|mean=approx. 1.29815x|stddev=approx. 1.04424x}}
'''rnz''' is a function that generates a random number with a distribution that is meant to peak at a given value and trail off at larger values.  A call of rnz(350), for example, gives the base [[prayer timeout]] and will often return a number close to 350, sometimes a number somewhat less or somewhat more than 350, and rarely a number much greater or much less than 350.

The most probable outcome (the mode of the distribution) turns out not to be the given parameter, but half of that number, as can be seen in the graph to the right.  The mean outcome, on the other hand, is about 1.30 times the given parameter.

rnz is used for the following purposes:

* rnz(100) is the time that one must wait after [[invoke|invoking]] an [[artifact]] before invoking it again.

* rnz(10) (or rnz(25) when first building a [[level]]) plays a part in determining when a [[corpse]] disintegrates.

* A number of rnz calls are used in determining the [[prayer timeout]].  In particular, the timeout after successful prayer is rnz(350), with a penalty of rnz(1000) added if you are [[crowning|crowned]] or have killed the [[Wizard of Yendor]].  If you have killed the Wizard and are also crowned, the penalty is doubled.

== Mathematical analysis ==

rnz produces such a bizarre distribution that it is hard to tell what the original programmer had in mind.  It's quite possible that it was meant to be some distribution with Z in the name, but its construction doesn't seem to suggest one.

The code is quoted below, with some cleanup for readability:

<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
int
rnz(i)
int i;
{
        register long x = i;
        register long tmp = 1000;

        tmp += rn2(1000);
        tmp *= rne(4);
        if (rn2(2)) { x *= tmp; x /= 1000; }
        else { x *= 1000; x /= tmp; }
        return((int)x);
}</syntaxhighlight>

=== Probability density function ===

The rn2(2) call chooses, with equal probability, between two different distributions; one is

:<math> i \cdot \operatorname{rne}(4) \cdot \frac{1000 + \operatorname{rn2}(1000)}{1000}</math>

and the other is

:<math> i \cdot \left[ \operatorname{rne}(4) \cdot \frac{1000 + \operatorname{rn2}(1000)}{1000} \right]^{-1}</math>.

The function is easier to analyze if the expression

:<math>\frac{1000 + \operatorname{rn2}(1000)}{1000}</math>

is modeled as a [[wikipedia:Uniform distribution (continuous)|continuous uniformly distributed variable]] with range from 1 to 2.  Let this variable be called '''z'''.  For the case where the variable '''i''' is divided by the random formula, it helps to know the distribution of the reciprocal of z; it is z<sup>-2</sup> for 0.5 <= z <= 1, and 0 otherwise.

The [[rne]](4) call returns an integer from 1 to 5, with the following probabilities:

{| class="wikitable"
!Return!!Probability
|-
|1||3/4
|-
|2||3/16
|-
|3||3/64
|-
|4||3/256
|-
|5||1/256
|}

If the hero's [[experience level]] is 18 or greater, then rne can return numbers greater than 5; but this event has low probability (1/1024 for all experience levels 18 or greater), and to keep this explanation simple it will not be considered.

We can now consider all possible outcomes of the rn2(2) and rne(4) calls:

{| class="wikitable"
!rn2(2) returns||rne(4) returns||Probability||Outcome||Range||Distribution

|1||5||<math>\frac{1}{512}</math>||<math>\frac{1}{5z}</math>||<math>\frac{1}{10}</math> to <math>\frac{1}{5}</math>||<math>\frac{x^{-2}}{2560}</math>

:<math>\mu = \ln(2) \cdot \frac{4419}{10240}+\frac{1023}{1024} \approx 1.29815.</math>

Thus the mean result of a call to rnz(x) is 1.29815x.  The mean prayer timeout, then, is 454.351 turns. (Actually, it is 453.787, so the error introduced by treating Z as continuous is quite small.)

=== Standard deviation ===

The [[wikipedia:standard deviation|standard deviation]] of a variable with probability density function <math>p(x)</math> and mean <math>\mu</math> is:

:<math>\sigma = \sqrt{\int_{-\infty}^\infty (x-\mu)^2 \, p(x) \, dx} .</math>

Since <math>\mu</math> is a constant, we carry it through the calculation and substitute it at the end. The integral under the square root sign is the ''variance'' and we calculate it thus:

Collecting terms and applying the laws of logarithms gives

:<math>\frac{1136891}{409600}-\mu\left(\frac{1023}{512}+\ln(2)\frac{4419}{5120}\right)+\mu^2</math>

and substituting the value of <math>\mu</math> gives

:<math>\frac{46597799}{26214400}-\ln(2)\frac{4520637}{5242880}-\ln^2(2)\frac{19527561}{104857600}.</math>

This is the variance of the underlying variable; the standard deviation is its square root:

:<math>\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{46597799}{26214400}-\ln(2)\frac{4520637}{5242880}-\ln^2(2)\frac{19527561}{104857600}} \approx 1.04424.</math>

The standard deviation of rnz(x), then, is 1.04424x, or 365.483 for an ordinary prayer timeout. (Actually, it is 365.344, so the error introduced by treating Z as continuous is quite small.)

'''rne''' returns a random number with a bounded [[wikipedia:geometric distribution|geometric distribution]].  That is, each possible return greater than 1 has a probability that is a fixed fraction of the next lower return, up to a given limit.  The fraction is 1 divided by the parameter of rne; thus <tt>rne(3)</tt> returns 2 one third as often as it returns 1, 3 one third as often as 2, and so on.
The maximum return is 5 while the hero's [[experience level]] is less than 18; from that point, it is the experience level divided by 3 and rounded down.  As experience level cannot exceed 30, the upper bound of rne can never be greater than 10.

A call of <tt>rne(3)</tt> is used to determine the [[enchantment]] of randomly generated [[weapon]]s, [[armor]], and [[ring]]s.  A call of <tt>rne(4)</tt> is a component of [[rnz]].

== Mathematical analysis ==

The effect of [[experience level]] on the return from rne is often overstated.  Only possible returns greater than 5 are affected, and these are improbable events in any case.  Thus, while a level 30 hero could in principle find a random [[weapon]] with +10 enchantment, this is a rare event indeed.

Here are the probabilities of each return from <tt>rne(3)</tt> for experience levels 1 and 30:

{| class="wikitable"

===Description in terms of the Wikipedia article===
For the formulae in the [[wikipedia:geometric distribution|Wikipedia article on the geometric distribution]], the value of <tt>p</tt> for a call of <tt>rne(x)</tt> is the probability that the returned value will be 1; this value is <math>1-1/x</math>.  The mean and standard deviation for the above infobox are calculated accordingly; but they are approximate, as for the sake of simplicity they give the values for the ''unbounded'' geometric distribution, and the return value from <tt>rne</tt> is bounded.

'''Gentoo''' is the GNU/Linux distribution that has the users that compile all of their own software. There are other such distributions, including Source Mage, but Gentoo is leading.

The command <tt>emerge nethack</tt> will probably give the latest version of [[NetHack]] to a Gentoo user, though it helps that 3.4.3 has long been current. However, the online package database suggests that <tt>emerge slashem</tt> will continue to give you [[SLASH'EM]] 0.0.7E6F0, unless you request the unstable build for 0.0.7E7F2. Gentoo does not seem to provide 0.0.7E7F3.

Though Gentoo facilitates certain customisations of the system, such as "Hardened Gentoo", if you want to build NetHack with your own selection of [[patch]]es, you are probably better to do it manually than to go through their "Portage" system, unless you want to generate your own ebuild (configure and build script).

Perhaps a fortune cookie could read:

: <tt>They say that [[Debian]] and Gentoo are the best at providing current versions of packages.</tt>

However, another one may read:

: <tt>They say that "emerge --sync" may give you a broken system.</tt>

The <tt>emerge --sync</tt> command upgrades the scripts that build Gentoo packages to the latest version. This also includes the list of masked packages. Since the ebuild <tt>games-roguelike/nethack</tt> is masked, further <tt>emerge</tt> commands tend to fail, because <tt>emerge</tt> detects an installed ebuild that is masked. The problem can be solved by inserting the line

: <tt>games-roguelike/nethack</tt>

in <tt>/etc/portage/package.unmask</tt>. This approach is superior to removing it from <tt>/usr/portage/profiles/package.mask</tt>, since the contents of <tt>/etc/portage</tt> are not overwritten by <tt>emerge --sync</tt>. This same approach is effective for [[Sabayon Linux]] as well, since it's essentially a customized Gentoo.

To find out why nethack (and SLASH'EM) are masked have a look at the Gentoo bug tracker [http://bugs.gentoo.org/125902].

'''Debian''' is a [[free]] operating system. Debian works exceptionally well as a [[server]]; Debian GNU/Linux is the operating system underneath [[nethack.alt.org]]. Debian also powers some desktops, though many users have [[Ubuntu]], a variant of Debian that makes frequent releases of the most important software.

Debian GNU/Linux is exceptional because it supports 11 processor architectures and has more than 18 thousand packages. No other distribution of [[GNU]] and [[Linux]] is more comprehensive; perhaps only [[NetBSD]] can claim to support more processor architectures than Debian.

Debian also does a great job of providing current versions of packages (in the "unstable" repository, because Debian sometimes waits almost three years between releases). This is not an issue with [[NetHack]], because 3.4.3 has been current for a very long time. However, Debian "unstable" already contains version 0.0.7E7F3 of [[SLASH'EM]].

The Debian NetHack package is maintained by Joshua "joshk" Kwan.

Perhaps a fortune cookie could read:

: <tt>They say that Debian and [[Gentoo]] are the best at providing current versions of packages.</tt>

They have Debian GNU/kFreeBSD and Debian GNU/Hurd too. 

== Patches ==
The [http://packages.debian.org/unstable/nethack-common Debian NetHack package] has around 25 [[patch]]es that provide features ranging from simple UI enhancements and bug fixes to changes that affect the game play. Some of the larger patches include [http://bilious.alt.org/?45 hpmon], [[menucolors]], [http://bilious.alt.org/?42 sortloot], [http://bilious.alt.org/?40 dump] and a modifed version of [http://bilious.alt.org/?44 paranoid]

'''Dwarves''' are monsters that are usually found in the [[Gnomish Mines]], along with [[gnomes]]. They are part of the [[humanoid]] [[monster class]].

== Generation ==
Dwarves are common in the early game, and are especially easy to find in the [[Gnomish Mines]]; randomly generated dwarves are always peaceful towards [[Dwarf (starting race)|dwarven]] and [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomish]] characters, and will mostly be peaceful towards other [[lawful]] characters.

===Equipment===
Most dwarves start with [[iron shoes]] and a [[dwarvish cloak]] (independent 6/7 chance for each).

{{frac|4}} of dwarves will have a [[dwarvish iron helm]] and [[dwarvish short sword]]. Of these dwarves, half will receive either a [[dwarvish spear]] or [[axe]] with equal probability, and a [[dwarvish roundshield]]; the other half receives a [[dwarvish mattock]]. These dwarves have a further {{frac|3}} chance of receiving a [[dwarvish mithril coat]]

Of the other {{frac|3|4}} of dwarves, {{frac|3}} start with a [[pick-axe]], and the others get a [[dagger]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|367|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

== Strategy ==
Dwarves are slow, but can be well equipped. Dwarf lords and dwarf kings have two weapon attacks, which makes them quite deadly when wielding a dwarvish mattock, and they can have excellent [[AC]] from their starting armor.

Dwarves with digging tools, like the mattock or pick-axe, will use them to dig through the level.

It may be worth it for a [[lawful]] character to anger and kill dwarves for their equipment, but care should be taken, as this will anger every gnome and dwarf in your line of sight, and will lower your alignment for each one killed. Pets are able to kill peaceful dwarves with no consequences.

Dwarves using a dwarvish short sword, axe, dwarvish mattock, or dwarvish spear have better armor than dwarves using a dagger or pick-axe. This is useful knowledge if you are looking for a dwarvish iron helm or mithril-coat.

Since dwarf kings and [[mind flayers]] share the same glyph, you should use [[farlook]] to correctly identify a purple h, especially at lower [[dungeon level]]s or in the Gnomish Mines, where the random [[h]] class monster can be a mind flayer.

* Read a cursed [[scroll of gold detection]]. This will show a pile of [[gold]] at every trap location. It should also be noted that the gold will disappear when you come within line-of-sight of it, making it fine on the [[Plane of Earth]] and [[Plane of Air]] if you can memorize the location it was at, but not terribly useful on the [[Plane of Water]], where the portal moves, nor on the [[Plane of Fire]], where there are many fire traps and moving light sources (you'll see gold on the traps and on the portal until the gold becomes visible).
* Use a [[crystal ball]] and choose to search for [[^]]. Note that this will leave you immobile for d10 turns, which can be dangerous if you're low on HP or are being attacked, and has a chance of failing if your intelligence is less than 20.{{refsrc|src/detect.c|864|version=NetHack 3.4.3}} Because of the paralyzing effect, it's not a preferred method to detect the portals on the Planes, but it's workable if you have no scrolls of gold detection or are going for the [[illiterate]] conduct. (Getting engulfed by a [[vortex]] before attempting to use a crystal ball on the Plane of Air or Plane of Fire is a wise move--if you're engulfed by an air elemental while helpless, you may lose a lot of HP.)
* Zap a [[wand of secret door detection]] or the {{spell of|detect unseen}} spell, which will detect the portal (and all other hidden traps and doors) if it is within radius of 8.
* Apply a charged [[Bell of Opening]] -- this will work the same way as the wand of secret door detection.
* Wield or wear the [[Amulet of Yendor]] -- this works only on the Planes, and only detects portals, not traps. There is a 1/15 chance each turn that you will get messages ("The Amulet of Yendor feels warm.") if within 12 squares of the portal.{{refsrc|src/wizard.c|65|version=NetHack 3.4.3}} See the [[Amulet of Yendor]] article for more details.

}}

The '''mood ring''' is a [[SLASH'EM]] item.
<ref>http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/slashem/rings.html</ref>
It has no effect when worn or eaten, but can be [[read]] for a clue about your [[alignment record|alignment]].
The message obtained by dropping a mood ring down a [[sink]] is '''"The sink looks groovy"'''.

== Reading Mood Rings ==
To read a mood ring, you must be wearing it, it must not be [[cursed]], and you must not be [[blind]] or [[hallucinating]].
When read, the ring will glow a different color depending on your alignment:

{|class="wikitable"
! Alignment
! Color
|-
| 14 or more
| Green
|-
| 4-13
| Yellow
|-
| 1-3
| Orange
|-
| 0 or less
| Red
|}

== Strategy ==
Because this ring provides no passive bonus of any kind, it is best to put it on, read it, then immediately take it off; else you suffer from unnecessary [[ring hunger]].

[[Apply]] them to cut [[cloth]] items into [[bandage]]s. The resourceful [[adventurer]] may wish to undo some [[tailoring]] and destroy spare [[cloak]]s and other cloth items that the adventurer recovers from the dungeon.

Scissors are most effective in the hands of those who know [[bandage]]s best: either a [[Healer]], or alternatively a [[female]] wearing either a [[nurse cap]] or [[nurse uniform]].

== Messages ==
{| class="prettytable"
|| "You can't cut that!"
|| You tried to cut a [[material]] other than [[cloth]], so nothing happened.
|-
|| "You can't cut something you're wearing."
|| Regardless of how low your [[intelligence]] or [[wisdom]] may be, ''[[NetHack brass]]'' does not permit [[you]] to injure yourself by applying scissors to that [[cloak]] or [[robe]] on your [[body]].
|-
|| "You cut your (item) asunder."
|| You completely destroyed the item without producing any bandages. (The yield of bandages would have been zero or negative.)
|-
|| "You cut your (item) into a bandage."
|| You produced one bandage.
|-
|| "You cut your (item) into some bandages."
|| You produced multiple bandages.
|-
||
"Oops!  (count) bandages slip away from you!" (when you are underwater, on the [[Plane of Air]], or inside a monster that engulfed you)

"Oops!  (count) bandages slip to the floor!" (anywhere else)
|| You managed to produce some bandages, but you had not enough room to carry them in your [[inventory]].
|}

== Yield ==
If you use a scissors to cut an existing bandage, then you destroy it. Otherwise, you destroy the [[item]] but produce some number bandages. You can produce the most bandages if either you are a [[healer]], or you are a [[female]] wearing a [[nurse cap]] or [[nurse uniform]]:

{| class="prettytable"
! Item
! Amount (before adjustments)
|-
|| [[mummy wrapping]]                         || 1 bandage
|-
|| [[kitchen apron]], [[frilled apron]]       || 3 bandages
|-
|| [[towel]], [[T-shirt]], [[Hawaiian shirt]] || 5 bandages
|-
|| [[nurse uniform]]                          || 7 bandages
|-
|| other [[cloth]] items || [[weight]] divided by 4
|}

If you are not a healer, and you are not a female wearing a nurse cap or nurse uniform, then you will only produce a random number of bandages, from 0 to the number in the above table. If the scissors are cursed, then you produce 1 or more fewer bandages. If your [[dexterity]] is less than 18, then you produce 1 or more fewer bandages. (The two effects are compounding if you use cursed scissors while your dexterity is less than 18.) However, neither of these penalties applies to healers, or to females wearing a nurse cap or nurse uniform.

The new bandages inherit their [[beatitude]] from both the scissors and the cloth item that you cut. If either the scissors or the cloth was blessed, then this makes blessed bandages; if either the scissors or the cloth was cursed, then this makes cursed bandages; but if one item was blessed and the other was cursed, then this makes uncursed bandages; otherwise both items were uncursed and this makes uncursed bandages.<ref>use_scissors, line 1492 of apply.c of NetHack brass 040923</ref>

== Dudley's dungeon ==
[[Dudley]] made use of a pair of scissors in two strips of ''[[Dudley's dungeon]]'':

* [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20070611 11 June 2007]
* [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20070612 12 June 2007]

These strips follow the rules of [http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=149454 rock, paper, scissors]. By simply wielding the scissors, Dudley can scare a [[paper golem]] into flight.

&&%s&& %s Bandage {71007 2011-06-10T10:12:26Z {4000092 Graham87} copyedit ''[[NetHack brass]]'' introduces a new [[item]], the '''bandage'''. If you find a pair of [[scissors]], then you may use them to cut [[cloth]] items into bandages. A cursed bandage is dangerous, but an uncursed or blessed bandage may heal you slightly.

Bandages are very crude; they are not easy to apply. You need a random amount of turns, from 10 turns to 9+500/([[dexterity]]+[[intelligence]]) turns, to apply a bandage. However, a [[Healer]], or a [[female]] wearing a [[nurse uniform]], needs only one-third as many turns. A [[female]] wearing a [[nurse cap]] needs only one-half as many turns. (Thus, a female Healer wearing a nurse cap, or a female wearing both a nurse cap and a nurse uniform, can apply bandages to herself at six times the normal speed.) You will always give up after 50 turns.

An uncursed bandage heals 4d4 [[HP]]. A blessed bandage heals 6d4 HP.

A cursed bandage is "unclean". When you apply it, it causes 1d15 damage, except that 1/13  of cursed bandages are "badly contaminated" and cause a [[disease]]! This disease will become an [[instadeath]] (by "medical malpractice") after as few as 20 turns, and is ''exactly'' like a disease attack from [[Demogorgon]], [[Juiblex]] or [[Pestilence]]!

expands to:

 {{sourcecode|hack.c|2676|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}.

Please try to do this for every use of the template, because source line numbers have a tendency to change when a new [[NetHack]] version is released, causing the link to no longer go to the right place. (You may need to give the directory explicitly.)

Instead of using this template between <nowiki><ref></nowiki> and <nowiki></ref></nowiki> tags, use {{tl|refsrc}}, which is less likely to change as a result of a version update.
