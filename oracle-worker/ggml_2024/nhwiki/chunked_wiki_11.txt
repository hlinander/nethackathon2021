Scrolls comprise 16% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
18% in containers, 22% on the Rogue level, and 1% in hell.  PROB is
the relative probability of each subtype.  Scrolls appear 1/8 cursed,
3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.

Scrolls of mail exist only if this ability was compiled into your
copy of the game, and if you have the "mail" option enabled.  When
new email arrives (or every 1999+d(3000) turns if playing on an
Amiga or DOS platform), the "mail daemon" will deliver a scroll of mail.
All of these scrolls are considered uncursed, and they cannot be changed
into another object in any way.

MRKR specifies the value used to determine the number of magic marker
charges needed to write a scroll of that type, or zero if it cannot be
written.  The actual number of charges used will be a random amount
from MRKR/2 to MRKR-1; if your marker has fewer than MRKR/2 charges,
you will be unable to attempt to write the scroll.

Wizards have a base 1/3 chance of writing an unknown scroll, and all other
classes have a base 1/15 chance; your chance generally improves with
higher luck, to a maximum of about 98% for Wizards and 32% for other
classes.  You can only write scrolls on blank paper, which can be made by
getting any scroll wet (except mail) or cancelling any scroll (except
mail).  Failure to write the scroll will cause the blank scroll to be used
up.  You can select non-blank scrolls to write on, but this will abuse
your wisdom and you will be told, "That scroll is not blank!"

Some types of scrolls have the same APPEARANCE when unidentified.  The
appearance of the remaining scrolls are are randomized from the following

Scroll messages and effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "scrolls", by Ian Burrell.)

In order to read a scroll, you must either be unblind or know the
APPEARANCE of the scroll.  When a scroll is read, it will be used up
and disappear (except blank paper).  The effects depend on the blessing
of the scroll.  Non-cursed means either blessed or uncursed.  If you
are confused while reading the scroll, "you mispronounce the magic
words" and may obtain a different effect. Some scrolls have a different
message for "beginners"; a character is considered a beginner until
accumulating 2000 score points (1000 for Wizards).

amnesia
  All Sokoban maps are immune from the effects of amnesia.
  cursed or you are NOT confused
    You forget all of the current level.
  non-cursed and confused
    You forget 6/7 of the current level.
  In addition, if uncursed or cursed
    You forget any number of spells.
  In every case,
    You have a 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of all known level
    maps and a separate 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of object
    identities.
    You forget all traps on your current level, forget whether you are
    punished, and abuse your wisdom.
      "Your mind releases itself from mundane concerns."  (hallucinating)
      "As your mind turns inward on itself, you forget everything else."
        (your character's name is Maud);
      "Who was that Maud person anyway?"  (otherwise, 50%)
      "Thinking of Maud you forget everything else."  (otherwise, 50%)
    The scroll is (re-)identified.

blank paper
  You identify the scroll; it will not be used up.
    "This scroll seems to be blank."  (unblind)
    "You don't remember there being any magic words on this scroll."
    (blind)

charging
  blessed
    You identify the scroll and select an item.
      "This is a charging scroll."
    If the item can't be charged, no effect.
      "You have a feeling of loss."
    Otherwise, the item is charged by a larger amount (see wan1-343.txt,
    tool-343.txt, or ring-343.txt for specifics). Wands and rings may
    explode (see below).
      "Your <ring> spins clockwise for a moment."
      "Your <item> glows blue for a moment."  (unblind)
      "Your <item> vibrates for a moment."  (blind)
  uncursed
    You identify the scroll and select an item.
      "This is a charging scroll."
    If the item can't be charged, no effect.
      "You have a feeling of loss."
    Otherwise, the item is charged by a smaller amount (see wan1-343.txt,
    tool-343.txt, or ring-343.txt for specifics). Wands and rings may
    explode (see below).
      "Your <ring> spins clockwise for a moment."
      "Your <tool> glows white for a moment."  (unblind)
      "Your <wand of wishing> glows blue for a moment."  (unblind)
      "Your <item> glows briefly."  (unblind)
      "Your <item> vibrates briefly."  (blind)
  cursed
    You identify the scroll and select an item.
      "This is a charging scroll."
    If it is a ring, it loses 1 to 2 points of enchantment and may
    explode (see below).
      "Your <ring> spins counterclockwise for a moment."
    For other items, if it is blessed or has zero charges, no effect
    other than incrementing the recharged counter (although wands may
    explode; see below).
      "Nothing happens."
    Otherwise, it is set to zero charges. Wands may explode (see below).
      "Your <item> vibrates briefly."
  confused
    If your energy is at maximum, you gain 5d4 maximum energy.
    Your energy is increased to maximum.
      "You feel charged up!"

  Previously-recharged wands have a chance of exploding if you attempt to
  charge them further; wands of wishing will always explode, others
  have a chance depending on the number of times (x) recharged: 
  (x^3)/(7^3).

  When a ring with a positive enchantment is charged, it has an
  (enchantment before) in 7 chance of exploding.  Rings with
  enchantments of <= -5 or >= +7 will always explode when charged.

      "Wiped out all <monster>."
      "You feel dead inside." (@ or your own race while polymorped)
    NOTE: Not all species can be genocided.
  uncursed
    You can genocide one species; or you can choose 'none'.
      "What monster do you want to genocide? [type the name]"
      "Wiped out all <monster>."
      "You feel dead inside." (your own role or race while polymorphed)
    If hallucinating, the message will claim "Wiped out all <your role or
    current form>" but you are unaffected (unless you actually did choose
    your role, race, or current form).
    NOTE: Not all species can be genocided.
  cursed
    You are surrounded by 4 to 6 monsters of one species, if they are
    not already genocided or extinct (more than 9 Nazgul, 3 erinyes, or
    120 other already created). If you choose 'none', a monster species
    will be selected at random. The monsters will carry nothing.
      "What monster do you want to genocide? [type the name]"
      "Sent in some <monster>."
  confused and uncursed
    You genocide your own role.
      "Wiped out all <role>."
      "Wiped out all <current form>." (hallucinating and polymorphed)
      "You feel dead inside."  (while polymorphed)
  confused and cursed
    You are surrounded by 4 to 6 monsters of your own role.  The monsters
    will carry nothing.
      "Sent in some <role>."
      "Sent in some <current form>." (hallucinating and polymorphed)

gold detection
  blessed or uncursed
    If no gold, gold objects (if scroll blessed), or gold golems on that
    level outside your inventory, no effect.
      "You have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes."
        (beginner not hallucinating)
      "You have a normal feeling for a moment, then it passes."
        (beginner hallucinating)
      "You feel like a million zorkmids!" (polymorphed into gold golem)
      "You feel worried about your future financial situation."
        (carrying gold coins)
      "You feel materially poor."  (not carrying gold coins)
    Otherwise, you detect gold (and, if scroll blessed, gold objects),
    even buried or in containers, and gold golems on that level.
      "You notice some gold between your <feet>."
      (if just on your square)
      "You feel very greedy, and sense gold!"  (if elsewhere)
  cursed or confused
    If no traps on that level, no effect.
      "You have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes."
      (beginner not hallucinating)
      "You have a normal feeling for a moment, then it passes."
      (beginner hallucinating)
      "Your <toes> stop itching."  (otherwise)
    Otherwise, you detect traps (spaces with the ^ symbol) on that level.
    If the scroll is cursed, the traps are shown as gold ($ symbol); if
    you are hallucinating, they will appear as random objects; otherwise,
    they appear as known traps.  The vibrating square is NOT shown.
      "Your <toes> itch."  (if just on your square)
      "You feel very greedy"  (cursed)
      "You feel entrapped."  (otherwise)

The '''scroll of identify''' is a somewhat common [[scroll]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. When read, it [[Identify|identifies]] items in the player's [[inventory]], with the amount of items identified based on its [[beatitude]].

==Generation==
18% of all randomly generated scrolls will be a scroll of identify.

Writing a scroll of identify with a [[magic marker]] takes up 7 to 13 charges.

==Description==
Scrolls of identify are always safe to read, but noncursed scrolls are far more beneficial. When read, the scroll will [[auto-identify]] itself and reveal the full identity of at least one item in the player's open inventory; if the scroll is read while [[confused]], it will auto-identify itself with no further effect. If a scroll would identify a number of items less than the amount of unidentified items in the inventory, the player chooses which items to identify first.

If the scroll is blessed or uncursed, it will identify 1, 2, 3, 4, or all items in the inventory, with the probability of each number given in the table below;<ref>[[scrl-343.txt]]</ref> a cursed scroll will only identify one item. If the player's [[Luck]] is positive, a blessed scroll will always identify at least two items, with a {{frac|3|5}} chance of identifying more.

|}

==Strategy==
The scroll of identify is the only scroll with a base price of 20zm, making [[price identification]] trivial; it is also one of the most common scrolls randomly generated in the dungeon, to the point that the largest stack of unidentified scrolls in your inventory has a decent-but-unreliable chance to be a stack of identify scrolls.

Before reading any scroll(s) of identify, be sure to have as many unidentified items in your open inventory as is reasonably possible; if you have {{of|potion|holy water}} to spare, you can bless your scroll(s) beforehand to increase the chance of identifying more items. If reading the scroll(s) of identify in a [[shop]], you can also use price identification to prioritize which of the shop's wares to formally ID and get the most out of your scrolls.

A role such as [[Priest]] or [[Wizard]] that can learn the {{spell of|identify}} spell and train [[divination spells]] to [[Skilled]] or better can potentially render scrolls of identify redundant, though they may still be useful if the spell is forgotten at any point (e.g., you have also forgotten several other item identities due to a [[mind flayer]] or an ill-advised [[scroll of amnesia]]). A reliably-cast identify spell in combination with a source of energy such as [[The Eye of the Aethiopica]] lets you identify any object soon after you discover it, even if you only want to know its beatitude.

==Messages==
{{message|You identify this as an identify scroll.|You read a scroll of identify while confused.}}

==Variants==
===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], every role begins the game with knowledge of the label for the scroll of identify.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], to counterbalance the removal of the identify spell, scrolls of identify are made more reliable. Blessed scrolls always identify 7 items, and uncursed scrolls always identify 4; like in ''NetHack'', cursed scrolls only identify 1 item.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]] and [[SpliceHack-Rewrite]], the [[scroll of knowledge]] is a scroll with the same base price as the scroll of identify; 1 out of roughly every 10 scrolls that cost 20 zorkmids will be a scroll of knowledge, making price identifying scrolls of identify slightly less trivial.

===EvilHack===
[[EvilHack]] incorporates the [[SporkHack]] change that gives every role starting knowledge of the scroll of identify.

===Hack'EM===
[[Hack'EM]] incorporates both the SporkHack change granting every role knowledge of the scroll of identify (via EvilHack) and the scroll of knowledge from SpliceHack; due to the former change, the scroll of knowledge's base price is raised to 50zm in order to make it less trivial to identify via price.

&&%s&& %s Identification {148172 2022-09-17T15:41:21Z {4001483 Cathartes} move the part about stacking into the object id section '''Identification''' is considered by some to be the heart of [[NetHack]]. Most items in the game start unidentified and are described only by their appearance. There are many methods of identifying them.

== Mechanics of identification ==

===Type identification===
NetHack gives three 'levels' of type identification:

====Formal type identification====
Also known as '''auto-identification''', ''formal identification''' causes a type of item to be called by its proper name, overriding its appearance and anything you may have [[call]]ed the type.

====Informal type identification with a prompt====
In some cases, you will be prompted to say what you want to [[call]] an type of item that has just been used, either by you or a monster. This can occur, for example, if you are hit by a [[potion]] thrown by a [[monster]] in circumstances that will not auto-identify it. Potions used by monsters giving unusual effects will also do this, such as a [[cursed]] [[potion of gain level]]. Dropping rings down sinks sometimes yields such a prompt too.  If the type is already called by a name, you are not asked for a new name; if it was used up, you can #name the item from the discoveries list.

====Informal type identification with no prompt====
In some cases, the effect of an action will unambiguously identify it to a fully spoiled player, even though NetHack declines to auto-identify it. This happens in most cases when [[engraving]] with [[wand]]s, and when an item's [[Price identification|price]] uniquely identifies it. In these cases, and any ambiguous cases that reduce the possibilities, you will have to use #name to call the type an appropriate name.

Sometimes, a certain action will use up an item in one case, and retain it in another. In these cases, you should call the item by the name of the item that would disappear, then rename it afterwards if it is still available. A common situation for this is throwing gems to unicorns; the unicorn will "gratefully" accept valuable gems, "graciously" accept glass which is not #named, and be "not interested in your junk" and drop #named glass. #naming the gem to distinguish one or the other first means you will know when you next find one.  If you have a single gem of a type, you can #name it "good red", throw it, and if the unicorn refuses the gem, rename it to "red glass".  Various cases of #[[dip]]ping items into potions fall into this category too.

===Individual object identification===
Each individual object has properties that can be identified: [[BUC]] for everything except gold pieces, [[erodeproof]]ness for weapons and armor, and [[enchantment]] or [[charge]]s for weapons, armor, wands, and some rings and tools.

[[Stack]]able objects with the exact same BUC/erodeproofness/enchantment status will not stack if their identification statuses are different.  For example, if you split a stack of unidentified items, and then formally identify any property of one of split stacks (through any means, whether it is a scroll of identify, or dropping one stack on an altar to formally BUC it), the other stack will not have this object-specific identification "transfer" to it if you attempt to re-merge the stack, although both stacks will still be type-identified.  In order to ensure that stacks merge, you must make sure that their identification statuses are also identical.

==Straightforward identification==
None of these methods are based on the item's behavior, all are universal, and all result in formal identification by the game engine (don't require naming).

===Initial knowledge===
Items that you start with are automatically identified for you. This is particularly useful for wizards, who will have 2 spellbooks, 3 scrolls, 2 rings and 1 wand identified from the beginning. In addition, depending on your role you may have some knowledge in weapons and armors. Also, if you start with an [[oil lamp]], the [[potion of oil]] will be identified for you.

===Scroll of identify===
When reading a [[scroll of identify]], you will be allowed to ID one or more of your possessions depending on the scroll's [[beatitude]]. The odds are:
{| class="wikitable"

===Spell of identify===
{{main|Spellbook of identify}}

Casting this divination spell has the same effect as reading a uncursed scroll of identify (if cast at Unskilled or Basic) or a blessed scroll (if cast at Skilled or Expert).

===Sitting on a throne===
One of the possible [[throne]] effects is the same as that of reading a blessed scroll of identify.

===Touchstone===
{{main|Touchstone}}
A [[blessed]] [[touchstone]] will formally identify all valuable [[gems]], worthless glass, and other [[gray stone]]s rubbed on it. A [[gnome (starting race)|gnome]] or [[archaeologist]] may also use an uncursed touchstone for formal identification. This is as good as the identify scroll or spell, except that it doesn't reveal the [[BUC status]] of the gem or stone.

===Selling in shops===
Selling or buying an item in a [[shop]] will cause the [[shopkeeper]] to tell you the appearance of the item. If the appearance is unique and not [[randomized appearance|randomized]], e.g. for most mundane [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s, he will identify the item class for you. This is probably only useful in [[zen]] conduct games (also: [[wand of probing]], [[potion of object detection]]).

==Indirect identification==
These methods require some knowledge (acquired from spoilers or experience), often lack universality, and don't always result in formal identification of an item as they sometimes give ambiguous information.
===Price identification===

{{main|Price identification}}

Although the price a [[shopkeeper]] charges is based on your [[Attribute#Charisma|charisma]] and slightly randomized, it is still helpful to some extent, but the main approach is to price ID using the selling price. This is very effective in categorizing rings, potions and wands for further identification using other means&mdash;even more so when direct identification is not possible, e.g. early games and illiterate games.

The simplest and most common application of price identification is identifying of the [[scroll of identify]] (the cheapest of the scrolls).

===Weight identification===
The weight of an unknown object is not nearly as useful as its price, but it can provide additional clues. This goes especially for cursed equipment you don't want to wear. In some cases such as [[levitation boots]], it is unique within a price group. Another example is a gray stone in a [[box]], which might be a [[loadstone]].

One practical way of weight testing is to pick up just enough rocks and gold not to be [[burdened]], pick up the object, and count the rocks and gold you need to drop to un-burden you. The spreadsheet [[File:Nh_inventory_weight.ods]] can count up your inventory weight.

===Behavior identification===
====Passive  identification====
This refers to discovering the properties of an [[item]] in a way that does not [[discoveries|auto-identify]] the item.
For example, [[zap]]ping an unidentified [[wand of cancellation]] at a [[dragon]] and hearing it cough; you know that it is a wand of cancellation, but the game will still give the [[randomized appearance]] as the identity of the wand.

====Identification by using====
Rings, potions, scrolls, and especially armor can be identified this way.

* Some items are identified instantly when you wear, quaff, or otherwise use them. Many potions do this, as well as some rings and armor (e.g. boots of speed, elven cloak).
* Some require a little time before you notice (e.g. [[ring of slow digestion]]).
* Some are identified when some special thing occurs (e.g. rings of different resistances, amulet of reflection, amulet of magical breathing).

You can also use [[enlightenment]] to identify intrinsic-providing items.

Always remember to take the utmost care when use-identifying things. Check its [[beatitude]] using a pet or altar. Check potions using a [[unicorn horn]] (although some players just quaff and heal themselves, since dipping a unicorn horn into a potion of polymorph causes the horn to be lost). Don't read unidentified scrolls when confused or when wearing a precious piece of armor.

Things that can be easily identified this way are:
* Cloaks &ndash; All the magical cloaks except [[cloak of magic resistance]] and (for invisible characters) [[cloak of invisibility]] auto-ID when you wear them. In this way, a non-invisible character can identify all cloaks unambiguously via wearing.
* Boots &ndash; [[Fumble boots]] and [[levitation boots]] are mostly generated [[cursed]]. [[Elven boots]] (for characters without stealth) and [[speed boots]] auto-ID on wearing. [[Jumping boots]] are trivial to identify. If nothing happens when you wear the uncursed pair and you can't [[jump]], you have either [[kicking boots]] or [[water walking boots]], or (if you have stealth) elven boots. You can sometimes discern between them if you are a spellcaster, as [[kicking boots]] hinder your spellcasting abilities.
* [[Whistle]]s &ndash; Blowing the whistle unambiguously identifies it. If you blow a [[magic whistle]] and you have a pet on the level, it will become identified as one.

====Identification by monster use====
Humanoid monsters will use certain items; this can be helpful in identification.

They are sometimes created wearing an [[amulet of life saving]] which will auto-identify when it resurrects them.

They will quaff beneficial potions (healing, extra healing, full healing, speed, invisibility, gain level, polymorph) and throw harmful potions (acid, blindness, confusion, sleeping, paralysis). Generally potions will auto-identify when quaffed or thrown by monsters, but the potion of confusion is an exception. This is because thrown booze has the same effect; however, monsters do not throw booze.

They will read scrolls of create monster, earth, fire, and teleportation. If a scroll read by a monster has no visible effect, it was most likely create monster, and the new monsters were out of your visual range.

They will zap you with attack wands, and will zap themselves with wands of polymorph, speed monster, make invisible or teleportation. This can help distinguish wands of cancellation, make invisible, and teleportation, which cannot be told apart by engraving.

====Wand engrave identification====
{{main|Wand#Engrave-identification}}

To do the identification, engrave something in the dust and then try to engrave something else with the wand on the same square. Nine wands can be unambiguously identified. The rest will give ambiguous results. Unlike the scroll or spell, the number of charges will not be revealed, except that you know you've just spent one. A wand with zero charges will have no effect, possibly misleadingly, so do not use this method with wands in [[bones]] piles.

====Dropping a ring into a sink====
{{main|Sink#Identifying rings with a sink}}
Unambiguously identifies most rings, but destroys the ring in the process. This technique is useful when you have multiple rings of the same type or when you are desperately looking for a [[ring of slow digestion]], which won't be lost in the sink.

===Monster inventory identification===
Some [[Monster starting inventory|monsters are more likely to possess certain items]]. For example, nymphs are often generated with a [[potion of object detection]], and elves with an [[elven cloak]] and [[elven boots]].

===Cheat===
A very easy way to identify all your items is to save the game, copy the save file, paste it, reenter the game, quit, and have your possessions identified. Note the items you have, then rename the copy with the same name as the initial, and you'll have your game as if nothing happened. Same things for attributes.

This is considered [[cheating]] and is frowned upon.

When you reach zero [[hit points]], you '''die'''. '''Death''' is also possible when you have nonzero hit points, by several methods of [[instadeath]] or [[delayed instadeath]]. You lose all the progress you made in that game, and you may have your [[Do you want your possessions identified?|possessions identified]], see your [[Enlightenment#Attributes displayed|attributes]] at the time of death (as well as a single post-mortem attribute), see a list of vanquished creatures, see a list of monsters [[genocide]]d, and see which official [[conduct]]s you have adhered to.
