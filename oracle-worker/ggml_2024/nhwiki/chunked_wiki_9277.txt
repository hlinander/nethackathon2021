====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "Beware, for Aglaope is immune to most songs."
 "At the Island of Anthemoessa you may face many beings controlled by Aglaope. Be cunning."
 "Aglaope can corrupt the Lyre of Orpheus. Hurry!"
 "<deity> will come to your aid when you call."
 "Use Aglaope's own ways against her; try to break her control over 
 the Island of Anthemoessa's wild life."
 "You will find the way to the Island of Anthemoessa near the back of the Conservatorium."
 "Go forth with the blessings of <deity>."
 "I will have my rhymers watch for your return."
 "Beware, the Island of Anthemoessa can be a very dangerous place."
 "You will feel when the Lyre if Orpheus is near.  Proceed with care!"

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 You see the Island of Anthemoessa. The entrance to the lair must be inside the old ruins...

When returning:
 You believe that you may once again invade the Island of Anthemoessa.

When first entering the goal level:
 You can feel in your soul that the Lyre of Orpheus is very near; its presence
 is soothing, even in this dark place.

When returning:
 The aura of the Lyre of Orpheus tingles at the edge of your perception.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 
 Aglaope holds the Lyre of Orpheus close to her face, and she seems to be
 quietly talking to it. After hearing you enter, she looks at you and her
 cold stare makes you paralyzed for a second; then her beautiful, frightening
 voice is heard:
 
 "Pindar sent one of his pupils instead of coming himself? 
 
 "Mortal hands do not deserve to touch the Lyre of Orpheus, its power is beyond 
 your understanding. I can use its melodies to control all beings, maybe even 
 nature itself... I know I can. It should always have been mine. I deserve it!"

Upon further meetings:
 
 "You again, <playername>?  You are not able to handle the Lyre of Orpheus... how could 
 a worm possibly understand the music of the gods?"


And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "I'm sure that your perseverance shall be the subject of innumerable
 ballads, but you shall not be around to hear them, I fear!"

When you have the Lyre of Orpheus, but Aglaope is still alive:
 "Please. You are a mere <role>, what could you possibly do?
 You think I can fall for your songs and sleep like a weakling?
 You do not deserve the Lyre of Orpheus"

====Discouragement====

Aglaope will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "I am not susceptible to feeble enchanting songs, you fool!"
 "Stop fighting. Just hear my voice... everything will be alright..."
 "I shall make the Conservatorium the palace of my empire over nature!
 The Lyre of Orpheus was always meant for me..."
 "Are you ready yet to beg for mercy?  I could be lenient..."
 "You shall join the enslaved multitude I command!"
 "Your soul belongs to me now, <playername>! Grovel before your queen!"
 "Your faith in <deity> is for naught!  Come, submit to me now!"
 "Go on, <playername>... You are just increasing my wrath..."
 "My loyal servants shall take care of you!"
 Aglaope laughs, and the ruins walls shake...

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you touch the Lyre of Orpheus, its harmonic power infuses you with joy.
 You finally understand what Pindar always meant when he talked about
 harmonizing with the living beings throughout the music.  Although you feel in
 your heart it accepting you as its new master, you know you must return it to
 its rightful owner, Pindar.

When killing the nemesis:

 Aglaope yells while her legs falter and she falls to the floor:
 
     No!  It can not be.  The Lyre of Orpheus is mine!  Mine!
 
 The Island of Anthemoessa seems to shake as Aglaope shrieks, 
 and then everything is silence.

When returning to your quest leader:

 Pindar notices the Lyre of Orpheus in your possession,
 smiles at you and says:
 
     I knew you could defeat Aglaope and retrieve Lyre of Orpheus.
     You are truly destined to be a great Troubadour.
 
     I feel the Lyre of Orpheus has already chosen to be used by you.
     Do not be shy, my <son|daughter>; it is yours know. May <deity> give you wisdom
     on how to use it.
 
     Now you are ready for a quest even greater. Go, and retrieve the
     Amulet of Yendor for <deity>.

When subsequently throwing the Lyre of Orpheus to Pindar:

 "You are the keeper of the Lyre of Orpheus now.  Return to the Dungeons of Doom,
 and continue with your quest."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Pindar after the quest:

 "Come near, my <son|daughter>, and share your adventures with me.
 So, have you succeeded in your quest for the Amulet of Yendor?"

When talking to Pindar after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Congratulations, <playername>.  I always knew that if anyone could succeed
 in defeating the Wizard of Yendor and his minions, it would be you.
 
 "Go now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
 the Amulet on the altar of <deity>.  Along the way you shall pass through the
 four elemental planes.  These planes are like nothing you have ever
 experienced before, so be prepared!
 
 "For this you were born, <son|daughter>!  I am very proud of you."

&&%s&& %s Furnace {145824 2022-05-01T19:24:15Z {4000978 Aximili} /* Comestibles */ A '''furnace''' is a [[dungeon feature]] introduced in [[SpliceHack]]. At a furnace, you can combine items to create other items. You can also imbue monster corpses and tins into weapons and armor.

==Generation==
There is a guaranteed furnace on the topmost level of [[Sokoban]].

==Effects==
===Quaffing===
[[Quaff]]ing from a furnace kills you; the furnace contains lava.

===Sitting===
[[Sit]]ting on a furnace deals fire damage to you.

===Dipping===
[[Dip]]ping anything into a furnace has a {{frac|1|30}} chance of blowing up the furnace. Dipping potions or scrolls into a furnace destroys them. If you #dip an item that can survive the [[Fire#Effects|lava damage]] into a furnace, such as a metallic weapon, there is a {{sfrac|1|30}} chance the item becomes [[blessed]], and a {{sfrac|1|30}} chance the item becomes [[erodeproof]]ed.

===Imbuing===
At the furnace, type #forge or press Alt Shift F. Use a weapon or armor as the first input item, then select a monster corpse, tin, figurine, or mask as the second item.

* '''Imbued weapons''' deal bonus damage dependant on the attack (ADTYPE) of the monster that was imbued. For example, a long sword imbued with blue dragon essence will shock enemies. This bonus damage is generally 1d6 of whatever the monster's first attack is.
* When polymorphing while wearing '''imbued body armor''', you will polymorph into the monster type that armor is imbued with. This includes normally non-polymorphable monsters.
** As of Spl-R-1.1.0, polymorphing into certain non-polymorphable monsters could be a [[bad idea]], as there is sometimes insufficient game logic for your new form. For instance, if you become Medusa, the game will crash, because players can't normally possess a petrifying gaze. Becoming a watch captain is fine, however.
* You cannot imbue weapons with cockatrice or Rider essence, but everything else is fair game!
* After imbuing an item, there is a 50% chance the furnace is used up.

===Forging===
Type #forge or press Alt Shift F to create new or changed items while standing at a furnace.

The '''Bag of the Hesperides''' is an unaligned [[artifact]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. Its [[base item]] is a [[bag of holding]], and it is made out of [[Object materials (EvilHack)|dragonhide]].

==Generation==
The Bag of the Hesperides is always found within a crystal [[chest]] inside the cage of the captive [[pegasus]], which is found at the end of the [[Ice Queen's Realm]]. It cannot be [[wish]]ed for due to its generation method, but also does not affect wishing for other artifacts.

==Effects==
The Bag of the Hesperides augments [[protection]] much like a [[ring of protection]], providing one additional level of [[magic cancellation]] when carried, and repels water just like an [[oilskin sack]]. It has 50% improved [[weight]] reduction compared to a normal bag of holding - it effectively reduces the weight of all items inside it by {{frac|3}} when uncursed, compared to {{frac|2}} with its base item. When blessed, the weight of its contents is reduced to {{frac|6}}, compared to {{frac|4}} from its base item. However, if the Bag of the Hesperides is cursed, it will ''quadruple'' the weight of its contents - twice the effect of a cursed bag of holding.

As with any other bag of holding in the game, inserting another bag of holding, a charged [[bag of tricks]], a charged [[wand of cancellation]], or [[Magicbane]] with a 10% chance will cause it to explode - this destroys the bag, the inserted item and {{frac|13}} of the bag's contents while scattering its remaining contents around, breaking [[fragile]] items in the process.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Perseus}}
{{Wikipedia|Hesperides}}
The Hesperides are the nymphs of evening and golden light of sunsets, who were known in Greek mythology as the "Daughters of the Evening" or "Nymphs of the West". They tended Hera's orchard in a land believed to be in a far western corner of the world; the nymphs and their garden feature prominently in one of the [[wikipedia:Labours of Heracles|Twelve Labours of Heracles]], and are additionally encountered by the [[wikipedia:Argonauts|Argonauts]]. The Hesperides also provide [[Perseus]] with the knapsack this artifact is based on that he would use to safely contain the head of [[Medusa]] after slaying her; the knapsack also serves as the inspiration for the [[Wallet of Perseus]] in [[SLASH'EM]]. Pegasus sprang from Medusa's blood upon her death, and is thus found with the chest containing the artifact in EvilHack.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"Now, this third handkerchief," Mein Herr proceeded, "has also four edges, which you can trace continuously round and round: all you need do is to join its four edges to the four edges of the opening.  The Purse is then complete, and its outer surface--"
"I see!" Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted.  "Its outer surface will be continuous with its inner surface!  But it will take time. I'll sew it up after tea."  She laid aside the bag, and resumed her cup of tea.  "But why do you call it Fortunatus's Purse, Mein Herr?"
The dear old man beamed upon her, with a jolly smile, looking more exactly like the Professor than ever.  "Don't you see, my child--I should say Miladi?  Whatever is inside that Purse, is outside it; and whatever is outside it, is inside it.  So you have all the wealth of the world in that leetle Purse!"
|[ Sylvie and Bruno Concluded, by Lewis Carroll ]

'''Valavi''' are a special type of [[Shopkeeper]] found in the [[dNetHack]] [[Law quest (dNethack)|law quest]]. They sell ceramic(1) and woolen(2) armor, [[shepherd's crook]]s, [[figurine]]s of sheep, and [[slime mold|fruit]] with hard-coded alternate names.

1: Lightweight ceramic armor, which is a form of stone. Does not interfere with spellcasting. Example: ceramic helmet.

2: Grants resistance to fire and cold in addition to any other properties, typically modifies cloaks. Also makes the item immune to fire damage, if it was vulnerable previously. Example: woolen cloak of magic resistance.

SpliceHack's thriae are in the [[ant|{{white|a}}]] class. They aren't guaranteed to appear on any special level, and are rarely generated.

===Encyclopedia entry===
{{encyclopedia|Trifling with bee maidens often leads to getting stung.}}

{{clear}}
==Origin==
In Greek mythology the thriae were nymphs: they had the head and torso of human women, and the lower body and wings of a bee. This is probably why they have seduction and stinging attacks in both dNetHack and SpliceHack.

The '''mumak calf''' is a younger version of the [[mumak]] that appears in [[dNetHack]].

==Generation==
Mumak calves have the same difficulty as mumakil do in ''[[NetHack]]'', and thus appear in most of the same areas; this is an adjustment to compensate for mumakil being much higher-level monsters.

Mumak calves can [[grow up]] into mumakil.
