The '''yellow dragon''', {{monsym|yellow dragon}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It has a younger form in the '''baby yellow dragon''', {{monsym|baby yellow dragon}}. The yellow dragon has [[acid resistance]] both intrinsically and from its scales, and as an [[acidic]] monster it is also immune to [[stoning]]; its breath weapon fires rays of [[acid]]. Its corpse is also acidic, but does not convey any resistances.

==Generation==
{{main|Dragon#Generation}}
Players will not see baby yellow dragons through normal random [[monster creation]] outside of the [[Oracle]] and [[Sokoban]] levels, and they can also be hatched from dragon [[egg]]s; adult yellow dragons start appearing around the midway depths of the dungeon. Yellow dragons can be generated in [[throne room]]s as early as dungeon level 15, and may appear when a [[throne]] at this depth or lower is [[loot]]ed.{{reffunc|mkroom.c|courtmon}} Yellow dragons can be generated if a lawful spellcaster casts the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]].

In addition, the fourth variant of [[Medusa's Island]] has a yellow dragon generated asleep behind Medusa's dwelling; she nests on 1-3 baby yellow dragon eggs, and there may be up to two live babies sleeping next to her. 

Yellow dragons have a {{frac|3}} probability of dropping a set of +0 uncursed [[yellow dragon scales]] along with their [[corpse]] ({{frac|20}} if the dragon was [[revive]]d).

==Strategy==
The yellow dragon's acid blasts can ruin metal armor and weapons unless they are [[Erosion|corrodeproofed]], making it dangerous to be caught down line-of-sight from one (though not to the same extent as other dragons like the [[black dragon]]). Its breath weapon can be deflected with [[reflection]], thankfully - for players lacking reflection, however, it has the fewest means of direct resistance available. Even the black dragon's [[disintegration]] has [[disintegration resistance|a resistance]] that can be gained intrinsically, albeit only by eating its meat or that of the [[poisonous]] [[Chromatic Dragon]]. Conversely, acid resistance cannot be gained intrinsically except by [[Polyself|taking the form]] of an acidic monster, and is only granted extrinsically via yellow dragon scales, [[yellow dragon scale mail]], or an [[alchemy smock]].

While not desired to nearly the same extent as those of a [[gray dragon|gray]] or [[silver dragon]], yellow dragons are sometimes worth seeking out for their scales to give a humanoid [[pet]] resistance against dangerous acid passives - especially if that pet has multiple attacks, e.g., a tamed (master) [[mind flayer]]. Yellow dragons themselves are solid choices for stoning-resistant pets, being among the strongest acidic monsters in the game.

==History==
[[NetHack 2.3e]] introduces the yellow dragon along with all of the other modern dragon types and their breath weapons, except for silver.

[[NetHack 3.0.0]] introduces baby yellow dragons alongside the other baby dragons. This version also distinguishes all color dragons, their younger stages and their corpses, and introduces dragon scale mail.

[[NetHack 3.1.0]] introduces yellow dragon scales along with the other colors, as well as the current method of obtaining dragon scale mail.

The version of Medusa's island with the guaranteed yellow dragon and her offspring was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.0]]; this particular yellow dragon may be based off the [[wikipedia:Amphisbaena|Amphisbaena]], who is said to have been created along with various other serpents from the blood dripping out of Medusa's severed head.

==Variants==
Variants of ''NetHack'' often subject dragons to extensive changes, including the green dragon.

===Biodiversity patch===
In the [[biodiversity patch]], the yellow dragon is renamed to the '''guivre'''.

===SLASH'EM===
{{Main|Dragon (SLASH'EM)}}
As with all other dragons in SLASH'EM, baby yellow dragons have a base level of 4 instead of 12, and can be encountered via random generation in ordinary levels with a frequency of 2; they are also eligible for creation on many levels that generate random {{white|D}} on level creation. Adult yellow dragons have a base level of 18 instead of 15.

Baby yellow dragons hit as a +1 weapon, and adult yellow dragons hit as a +3 weapon. Adult yellow dragons will not turn [[traitor]] while tame.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], all dragons have their breaths, resistances, and colors randomized, allowing any non-[[chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)|chromatic dragon]] to appear as yellow.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail, the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
{{right-align|[ Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]}}

"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's not a trick of mastering the dragons, as most people think. Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with a dragon:  will he talk to you or will he eat you?  If you can count upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why then you're a dragonlord."

{{for|the class of monster that includes this creature|Lizard (monster class)}}

A '''lizard''', {{monsym|lizard}}, is a monster that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

While seemingly unremarkable as enemies, lizard [[corpse]]s and meat serve a vital purpose to aspiring adventurers - eating lizard meat cures gradual [[stoning]] and shortens the duration of any current [[confusion]] and [[stun]]ning to two turns.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1062|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=confusion and stun case}}{{refsrc|src/eat.c|3337|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=stoning case for lizard and acidic corpses}} Lizards themselves have [[stoning resistance]], and carrying a corpse on hand counteracts the immediate stoning that a [[cockatrice]] hiss can initiate during the [[time|new moon]].{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|1251|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} The lizard is the only member of its [[Lizard (monster class)|monster class]] to have these properties.

Monsters can use lizard corpses as [[defensive item]]s, and will eat lizard meat to cure stoning, stunning and/or confusion{{refsrc|src/muse.c|367|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} - monsters with a tin of lizard meat have a {{frac|2|3}} chance of opening it.{{refsrc|src/muse.c|376|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}  

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Lizard meat now grants temporary petrification resistance, like the meat of all [[stoning]]-resistant monsters. You will also get a message when you gain temporary stoning resistance such as: "'''You feel less concerned about becoming petrified.'''" and when that effect expires you get  "'''You no longer feel secure from petrification.'''" message.}}

==Generation==
Killing a lizard always leaves a [[corpse]] unless it is done via [[disintegration]] or [[engulfing]].

==Strategy==
Most players carry at least one lizard corpse in inventory, both to lower the odds of slowly turning to stone from footrice attacks and to immediately cure any such stoning should it occur. Lizard corpses do not rot and cannot become tainted from aging, though they can still be too old to sacrifice - as such, they are [[Autopickup exceptions#Never pick up corpses except lizards|a very common autopickup exception]].

Note that you do not have to finish the lizard corpse to prevent gradual stoning: simply taking a bite is enough. This can prove useful and allow you to get a couple of "unstonings" per corpse, especially since a hostile monster (usually the one attempting to stone you) will often interrupt you meal. Note that lizard meat '''does not''' prevent you from turning to stone if you make contact with or eat a stoning corpse (e.g. accidentally touching a cockatrice corpse by feeling around on the floor without [[glove]]s while [[blind]]); lizard meat also does not restore any [[intrinsic]] [[speed]] lost from turning to stone. In addition, be mindful of killing lizards around meat-eating pets, as they may quickly snatch up the corpse and consume it.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Monsters can now use the [[wand of undead turning]] against you if there are any corpses in your inventory; this is most likely to occur with lizard corpses you are carrying.}}

==History==
Both the lizard and lizard corpses date all the way back to Hack121, a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]], where they were first known as '''dead lizards'''; live lizards also appeared in Hack121. Prior to Hack 1.0, dead lizards were simply normal food items; from Hack 1.0 to [[Hack 1.0.2]], stoning by cockatrice hissing is an [[instadeath]], and lizard corpses reduce the duration of confusion instead. [[Hack 1.0.3]] introduces gradual stoning and gives lizard corpses their additional anti-stoning function. [[NetHack 3.0.6]] 're-introduces' the lizard as a monster, and their corpses are no longer a distinct item.

==Messages==
{{message|[[You feel]] limber.|You ate a lizard corpse and cured stoning; intrinsic speed is still lost.}}
{{message|What a pity - <you> just ruined a future piece of <fine> art!|As above while you are [[hallucinating]]; if your charisma is above 15, the message will say "fine art", and just "art" otherwise.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|749|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} This also applies to monsters that eat a lizard corpse or tin to cure stoning while you are hallucinating.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|2292|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}}}
{{message|<Monster> is slowing down. <Monster> eats a lizard corpse. <Monster> seems limber!|A monster ate a lizard corpse to cure stoning.}}
{{message|<Monster> is slowing down. <Monster> eats a lizard corpse. <Monster> seems steadier now.|The monster ate a lizard corpse to cure stunning or confusion.{{refsrc|src/muse.c|2253|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} The "slowing down" message appears incorrectly in this case because the "eat a lizard corpse to unstone" function is called. This also means that a monster with intrinsic speed loses it if it eats a lizard corpse.{{refsrc|src/muse.c|999|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/muse.c|2301|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}}}
{{message|You hear chewing.|As above, but unseen.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In SLASH'EM, lizard corpses are very hard for player [[Vampire (starting race in SLASH'EM)|vampires]] to utilize, as they cannot drain corpses more than a few turns old. It is still worth carrying one for the protection they provide on the new moon, but a vampire will instead need to rely on a [[potion of acid]], the {{spell of|stone to flesh}} spell or an [[amulet versus stone]].

===UnNetHack===
In UnNetHack, player [[Vampire (starting race in UnNetHack)|vampires]] face a similar dilemma to SLASH'EM, and should stock up on acid or use the stone to flesh spell.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], you can make [[Potion of blood|potions of monster blood]] via [[tinning kit]], which has the benefits of eating a lizard corpse when quaffed; player [[Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)|vampires]], [[Incantifier (dNetHack starting race)|incantifier]]s and [[android]] [[Anachrononaut]]s, can stockpile the blood of lizards or any acidic monster to cure stoning in the mid- and late game. Cave lizard corpses provide the same benefits as do their meat and blood, though their corpses eventually rot away unlike normal lizard corpses - the corpses are also much heavier to carry.

A lizard corpse is practically essential for any player to protect against not only stoning from cockatrices, but the [[flesh to stone]] [[monster spell]] and the clawing attack of a [[teraphim tannah]].

===The November NetHack Tournament===
In [[The November NetHack Tournament]], [[the DevTeam Office]] has a peaceful lizard known as the Lizard of Yendor.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Lizards, snakes and the burrowing amphisbaenids make up the
order Squamata, meaning the scaly ones.  The elongate, slim,
long-tailed bodies of lizards have become modified to enable
them to live in a wide range of habitats.  Lizards can be
expert burrowers, runners, swimmers and climbers, and a few
can manage crude, short-distance gliding on rib-supported
"wings".  Most are carnivores, feeding on invertebrate and
small vertebrate prey, but others feed on vegetation.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Dantes rapidly cleared away the earth around the chest.  Soon
the center lock appeared, then the handles at each end, all
delicately wrought in the manner of that period when art made
precious even the basest of metals.  He took the chest by the
two handles and tried to lift it, but it was impossible.  He
tried to open it; it was locked.  He inserted the sharp end
of his pickaxe between the chest and the lid and pushed down
on the handle.  The lid creaked, then flew open.
Dantes was seized with a sort of giddy fever.  He cocked his
gun and placed it beside him.  The he closed his eyes like a
child, opened them and stood dumbfounded.
The chest was divided into three compartments.  In the first
were shining gold coins.  In the second, unpolished gold
ingots packed in orderly stacks.  From the third compartment,
which was half full, Dantes picked up handfuls of diamonds,
pearls and rubies.  As they fell through his fingers in a
glittering cascade, they gave forth the sound of hail beating
against the windowpanes.

&&%s&& %s Warning {147042 2022-07-29T05:58:35Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* dNetHack */ {{otheruses|the property that alerts you to a hostile monster's presence|the 'warning' that allows you to sense specific monsters|warned of monster type}}
'''Warning''' is a [[property]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]'' and reveals the location of nearby hostile monsters that [[you]] cannot see.

==Sources==
Warning can be obtained extrinsically by wearing a [[ring of warning]] or carrying an [[artifact]] that grants warning, i.e. the [[Orb of Fate]] or the [[Master Key of Thievery]]. It can only be gained intrinsically by [[eating jewelry|eating a ring of warning]] or reaching a certain experience level as certain roles:

* XL 7 as a [[Monk]]
* XL 15 as a [[Caveman]], [[Healer]], [[Priest]], or [[Wizard]]

==Description==
[[Image:Telepathy vs warning.png|300px|right|thumb|The range of warning is indicated by question marks. In comparison, the range of unblind [[extrinsic telepathy]] is slightly smaller, and is indicated by flags.]]
While you possess warning, hostile monsters that are within a ten-tile radius and are at least level 4 will have their location marked with a number from 1 to 5 ({{red|1}}, {{red|2}}, {{red|3}}, {{magenta|4}}, {{brightmagenta|5}}) - in [[graphical user interface]]s using the default [[tileset]], such as the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] client nethackw, the numbers are replaced with colored question marks that correspond to the above numbers ([[Image:Warning_1.png]] [[Image:Warning_2.png]] [[Image:Warning_3.png]] [[Image:Warning_4.png]] [[Image:Warning_5.png]]).{{refsrc|display.h|38}}<ref>{{sourcecode|display.h|44}}, but see also {{sourcecode|hack.h|288}} and {{function|hacklib.c|dist2}}.</ref>

The number used to represent a monster is {{frac|4}} of [[Monster level|that monster's level]] - the result is rounded down to the nearest whole, and will go no higher than 5, while 0 is not displayed.  The glyphs displayed are described as an "unknown creature causing you &lt;feeling&gt;", where &lt;feeling&gt; is one of '''concern''', '''anxiety''', '''disquiet''', '''alarm''', or '''dread''' for warning levels one to five respectively. Warning levels will be chosen at random if you are [[hallucinating]].

Moving near a [[hiding]] monster such as a [[piercer]] or [[trapper]] while possessing warning will cause you to take a second look close by, revealing the monster. Additionally, warning produces messages to alert you when you are standing on [[ice]] that is going to melt in under 15 turns.

Note that moving with {{kbd|m}} while [[blind]] will still attack in some cases, possibly [[petrify]]ing you - [[bug#mattacks|this is very likely a bug]].

==Strategy==
Warning is a useful property to pair with other means of detecting hostile monsters, such as extrinsic [[telepathy]] - though it does not reveal their identity, it functions regardless of whether the monster is [[mindless]] or not, allowing it to cover "gaps" in telepathy. 

===Warning levels===
The following table lists which mindless monsters each warning may represent, assuming that the player already has extrinsic telepathy. As a result of this, the warning can vary - e.g., an [[ochre jelly]] can merit a warning number 1 or 2, depending on the dungeon level and your experience level at the time of its generation. Monsters may also shift warning levels after generation through growing up, e.g. via [[conflict]] or quaffing a [[potion of gain level]].

While not implemented, there is code to handle warning of monsters with a level below four - these would be represented by a {{white|0}} and described as causing you "worry".

<!-- monster levels range from base level - 1 to base level * 1.5; table ignores monsters leveling up after creation, mindless monsters can't quaff gain level so this may only happen through kills (e.g. conflict) -->

==History==
Warning has been present in ''NetHack'' since [[Hack 1.0|the first public release]] of ''[[Hack]]'' included the ring of warning; the current warning system was first implemented in [[NetHack 3.3.1]].

In prior versions, warning displayed messages when a hostile monster was nearby,{{refsrc|mon.c|267|version=NetHack_3.3.0}} and a ring of warning would flash a single color corresponding to the warning numbers in modern versions - pink corresponds to "1", red to "2", ruby to "3", purple to "4", and black to "5". Messages that were higher in the list took precedence over lower ones. When blinded, no warning messages were displayed; while hallucinating, they are referred to as "mood rings", and the colors were replaced with hallucinatory ones.

No warning messages were displayed if one had been displayed within your last ten actions, unless the new message reflected a higher level of warning than the previous one.

The [[Palantir of Westernesse]], the [[Elf (role)|Elf]] [[quest artifact]], conferred warning when carried from [[NetHack 3.1.0]] to [[NetHack 3.3.0]]; the role and its artifact were made defunct in 3.3.1.

===Older messages===
<!--{{message|Your Sting glows light blue!|You are wielding Sting, and the monster is an orc.}} This may be more relevant to Sting and/or being warned of monsters in general.-->
{{message|Your left/right ring glows <color>!"|You are wearing a ring of warning.}}
{{message|Your rings both glow <color>!|You are wearing two rings of warning.}}
{{message|You feel apprehensive as you sense a <color> flash.|You have intrinsic warning, or warning from an artifact.}}
{{message|Your spider-sense is tingling...|As above while hallucinating; this is a Spider-Man reference.}}

==Variants==
Many variants introduce additional sources of warning, usually from [[quest artifact]]s.

===Convict patch===
[[The Iron Ball of Liberation]] is the [[Convict]] quest artifact in most implementations of the patch, and grants warning when carried.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], [[The Candle of Eternal Flame]] and [[The Storm Whistle]] are additional artifacts that grant warning. The defunct artifacts [[The One Ring]] and [[The Pick of Flandal Steelskin]] also granted warning when carried.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], [[Itlachiayaque]] confers warning when carried.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], some roles can obtain warning through leveling up - the [[Zookeeper]] role starts with warning, the [[Officer]] role gains the property at XL 10, and the [[Ninja (role)|Ninja]] and [[Geek]] roles gain it at XL 15. Several other artifacts also confer warning as well:

* The [[Flute of Slime]] ([[Acid Mage]] quest artifact, when carried)
* The [[Cudgel of Cuthbert]] ([[Chevalier]] quest artifact, when carried)
* The [[Harp of Lightning]] ([[Electric Mage]] quest artifact, when carried)
* The [[Fire Chief Helmet]] ([[Firefighter]] quest artifact, when worn)
* The [[Lockpick of Arsene Lupin]] ([[Locksmith]] quest artifact, when carried)
* The [[Harp of Harmony]] ([[Musician]] quest artifact, when carried)
* [[Blackshroud]] ([[Undertaker]] first [[sacrifice gift]], when worn)
* The [[Golden Whistle of Nora]] ([[Zookeeper]] quest artifact, when carried)

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the [[Android]] and the [[Madman (dNetHack role)|Madman role]] gain warning at experience level 15. The [[Binder (dNetHack role)|Binder]] [[Spirits (dNetHack)|spirit]] Huginn and Muninn passively grants warning.

The Palantir of Westernesse is reintroduced in the [[Elvish Racial Quest]] as an artifact source of warning. Other artifacts also grant warning: [[Grayswandir]], [[The Black Crystal]] and [[The Rogue Gear-spirits]] while carried, [[The Hat of the Archmagi]] while worn, and [[Helping Hand]] while wielded.

[[Great Cthulhu]] is a monster that can be sensed within standard warning distance as "an unknown monster causing you dread", regardless of whether or not you possess the property.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], the [[Cartomancer]] gains warning at XL 7. [[Sharur]] also grants warning when wielded in weapon form.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], the Healer role no longer gains warning at XL 15, instead obtaining [[sickness resistance]]. The [[Infidel]] role gains warning at XL 15, and all [[Centaur (starting race)|centaurs]] gain the property at XL 10. Warning is also an [[object property]] that some armor and weapons may generate with.

The [[beholder]] is hard-coded to always show up as {{brightmagenta|5}} when detected via warning, regardless of its level.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], red [[dragon scale mail]] grants warning while worn.

===The November NetHack Tournament===
In [[The November NetHack Tournament]], the [[Really Cool Shirt]] grants warning when carried.

'''Mimics''' are a [[monster class|class of monsters]] whose main defense is to imitate an [[item]] or [[dungeon feature]]. Mimics can be small, large, or giant, and all three kinds are often located in [[shop]]s and [[Sokoban]]. They are slow but powerful hitters, making them a common cause of death early in the game; small mimics rank #6 on the list of [http://alt.org/nethack/topdeaths.html top deaths] on [[NAO]].

Large and giant mimics have a [[sticking attack]], which prevents the player from escaping the confrontation. Walking into a concealed large or giant mimic, or finding it by searching when adjacent, will automatically stick you. The sticking attack can be protected against with [[magic cancellation]].

Eating a mimic's [[corpse]] makes you imitate a pile of gold for a short time; if [[hallucinating]], you will mimic an orange instead.{{refsrc|eat.c|849}} This lasts for 20 turns in the case of a small mimic, 40 for a large one, and 50 for a giant mimic; in all three cases, the nutritional value is 10 times the time spent, so it's a net gain. Turning into gold is a weak form of polymorph: you won't polymorph if you have [[unchanging]], and you'll fall off your steed if you are [[riding]]. However, armor and such is not affected and your stats are unchanged.  This breaks polyselfless conduct{{reffunc|src/eat.c|cpostfx|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}.

A mimic is uncloaked when wearing a [[ring of protection from shape changers]].

==Generation==

There is a (Dungeon level)% chance that a square in a [[shop]] that would normally have an item will instead get a mimic imitating a shop item.

Two giant mimics, imitating boulders, always appear on the final level of [[Sokoban]].

Of course, mimics can be randomly generated like most monsters can. Mimics can be items (in rooms), boulders, unaligned altars (in temples), and even closed doors (in doorways) or staircases (in rooms) in the dungeon. For example, the Rogue quest home level has four staircase locations, but three of these (chosen at random) are actually mimics.

== Strategy ==

===Detection===

Mimics sometimes display as "mimic or strange object" ({{monsym|strange_object}},[[image:strange object.png]]). In shops, the chance of this happening is 10&nbsp;&times; (10 &minus; dungeon level)% on dungeon levels 1&ndash;9, and is {{frac|2|17}} otherwise. You should not attempt to walk onto such objects, as they are always mimics. It is dangerous but not unusual to confuse these with the [[armor]] symbol, which is {{white|[}} outside the [[Rogue level]], or with a [[chest]] ([[image:chest.png]]) in the tiles interface.

If you have [[warning]], anything that is an item when you can see it and a warning when you can't may be a mimic. If you are warned of a monster, and then see an item where the warning was, it is probably a mimic (or a snake or insect [[hide|hiding]] under the object). Do not walk onto the mimic to discover it, however, as doing so will cause you to stick to it. Throw a rock or piece of gold at it, instead.

[[Priest]]s and others with a healing spell can cast it at an object; this will produce a message such as "The wand seems a more vivid white than before," if directed at a mimic.

If you have [[telepathy]], a mimic will be readily visible as such, unless you are [[Hallucination|hallucinating]], in which case the mimic will appear as a random monster that does not move, assuming it is still asleep.

A method of checking shops for the presence of mimics is to throw 1 gold piece across the shop, as it is not lost but added to your store credit&mdash;but be careful that you don't anger the shopkeeper by hitting them with the coin.

Another method is the "One of these things is not like the others" method; if you walk into a shop that sells specific items and notice something that doesn't quite fit, chances are it's a mimic. This goes especially for chest- or armor-like "strange objects".

Applying a [[stethoscope]] on a cloaked mimic will also reveal it and wake it.

===Fighting===

If you find yourself fighting a mimic, one way to avoid being stuck is to take advantage of its slow speed by using [[projectile]]s. Even [[rock]]s can be sufficient given enough time, and if you run out, you can walk around the mimic and pick up your projectiles to throw them again. An [[aklys]] is probably the best option, being almost infinitely reusable; a [[polearm]] also works if you have one.

If you do become stuck, one way to extricate yourself is to engrave [[Elbereth]]. Due to the mimic's slow speed, you should have several chances to write successfully. Once you have a correct engraving (which you can confirm with [[near look]]), rest until the mimic flees to avoid smudging it. Note that you can't fall down a [[hole]] or go up or down stairs while stuck.

While mimics can be dangerous, they are exceedingly slow and are worth a fairly large amount of experience. It is recommended that you wake up the mimic from a range (throw a gold piece or rock at it) to ensure that you don't get hit by it. Remember that mimics can be worth enough experience points to make you advance a level; therefore, to take best profit of them it is usually best to wait till you are level 3 or more before dispatching them.

When fighting a mimic in a shop, beware of using ranged attacks; any missiles will automatically become the store's property, if the store buys that type of item. Spells of force bolt can destroy fragile items like potions, which you will have to pay for, and of course will hit the shopkeeper if he/she is standing behind the mimic.

=== Genocide ===

Mimics are a surprising candidate for early [[genocide]] or [[extinction]]. Since mimics are sometimes generated in place of shop items, preventing the game from generating more will make future shops better-stocked. This is a relatively small effect except in [[Orcus-town]], where it will greatly increase the number of real items in the abandoned shops.

=== Polymorph ===
Being polymorphed into a mimic (for instance, by a [[polymorph trap]]), is a rather bad situation. Mimics are not fast, do not have a lot of strength, and the large and giant versions even make you tear out of your armor and/or cloak. Furthermore, mimics do not have limbs, and are therefore unable to wield a weapon. The only thing which may help is attempt to hide via the [[Monster (command)|#monster]] command. This will make you mimic an object, and is not particularly useful, since monsters are able to easily find you. Returning to your original form is the best option.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], earlier versions and some variants based on those versions, the speed system functions differently, and an unhasted, unburdened player character always got four moves to the mimic's one. This allows for '[[hit and run]]' tactics that can consistently and reliably dispose of mimics with enough care - while characters with relatively high starting HP and AC can attack them more safely, skilled play means that even weaker roles can defeat mimics this way without taking a single hit. Eating a mimic corpse also didn't break polyselfless conduct.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

===Mimic===

{{encyclopedia|<poem>
The ancestors of the modern day chameleon, these creatures can assume the form of anything in their surroundings.  They may assume the shape of objects or dungeon features.  Unlike the chameleon though, which assumes the shape of another creature and goes in hunt of food, the mimic waits patiently for its meals to come in search of it.
</poem>}}

===Strange object===
{{encyclopedia|
He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive.
|[ Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky ]
}}

&&%s&& %s Ring strategy {130903 2020-01-15T14:40:25Z {4000471 Thrawcheld} only a cloak of protection gives MC3 in 3.6 There are 29 rings in NetHack, and only 2 ring fingers on each player. The rings have varying utility, hence a strategy of which ring to wear must be devised. Rings do cause [[ring hunger|extra hunger]] (some excessively) but after the [[mid game]] food should not be an issue, meaning there is no reason not to make use of the many ring intrinsics. The rings can be divided by how useful they are.  Note, however, that even "useless" rings can have some use (e.g., taming a pet with a meat ring, or wearing a ring of hunger to make it easier to eat multiple giants on a level).

Normally useless rings:

* [[meat ring|meat]]
* [[ring of aggravate monster|aggravate monster]]

Mostly useless rings:

* [[ring of adornment|adornment]]
* [[ring of hunger|hunger]]
* [[ring of sustain ability|sustain ability]]

Useful but supersedable rings:

* [[ring of protection from shape changers|protection from shape changers]]
* [[ring of stealth|stealth]]
* [[ring of cold resistance|cold resistance]]
* [[ring of gain constitution|gain constitution]]
* [[ring of gain strength|gain strength]]
* [[ring of increase accuracy|increase accuracy]]
* [[ring of increase damage|increase damage]]
* [[ring of invisibility|invisibility]]
* [[ring of poison resistance|poison resistance]]
* [[ring of see invisible|see invisible]]
* [[ring of shock resistance|shock resistance]]
* [[ring of fire resistance|fire resistance]]
* [[ring of searching|searching]]

Useful rings:

* [[ring of protection|protection]]
* [[ring of warning|warning]]
* [[ring of regeneration|regeneration]]
* [[ring of slow digestion|slow digestion]]
* [[ring of teleportation|teleportation]] and [[ring of teleport control|teleport control]]
* [[ring of polymorph|polymorph]] and [[ring of polymorph control|polymorph control]]

Essential rings:

* [[ring of free action|free action]]
* [[ring of levitation|levitation]]
* [[ring of conflict|conflict]]

This division is somewhat arbitrary, and many might disagree with the particulars; some prefer to wear slow digestion at all times, while others consider free action a nicety rather than a necessity.

The useless and mostly useless rings are usually discarded on sight, or stored for [[polyfodder]]. The third category of rings are very useful in the early game (a ring of poison resistance can be a life saver if you lack the intrinsic), but are superseded either by gaining the intrinsic or becoming as strong/tough/accurate as it is possible to be. Protection from shape changers is partially supersedable (for werecreatures, not protecting from chameleons etc), and only by wielding [[Werebane]], but a cloak with level 3 [[magic cancellation]] (only a cloak of protection as of 3.6.0) all but nullifies the lycanthropy attacks of were-creatures.

Remember that you can [[polymorph]] into a [[metallivore]] and attempt to gain intrinsics by [[eating jewelry|eating rings]] (a decent 1/3 chance per ring). You can accumulate many minor but useful intrinsics using spare rings this way (which can be in turn obtained via, for example, a bout of [[pudding farming]]), thus leaving your hands free for rarer or inedible rings.

More importantly, in the early to mid game, your choice of ring is limited to what you can find, so this page will discuss what to do when you actually have a choice.

The useful rings are good candidates to keep in your inventory at all times. A ring of protection looks less attractive later on when your AC is already below -30, as does a ring of warning, since several classes gain warning either as an intrinsic or as a property of their [[quest artifact]], or failing that an equally useful method of sensing monsters at a distance.

Regeneration is very handy in a prolonged fight, or when [[encumbrance|encumbered]]. Slow digestion is potentially a life saver for early spellcasters or those who are [[conduct]]-restricted in what they can eat (which mostly means vegan or vegetarian [[Monk|monks]]), but it is by no means compulsory later on (and indeed can be a hindrance if you come across a corpse that you really want to eat but are [[satiated]]; this is also the reason why rings of hunger are not in the completely useless category).

Teleport and teleport control are technically supersedable, but [[tengu]] are rare, so it is not always possible. A common strategy is to carry only the ring of teleport control, having purposely gained [[teleportitis]]. This is not a waste of a ring slot, since the extra effects of rings are most useful in large or difficult fights, and these occur disproportionately on [[non-teleport levels]] where you don't have to worry about teleportitis.

Polymorph and polymorph control are very advanced rings which, although useful, are best used in controlled circumstances such as a locked co-aligned temple with nearby stash. Hence they are not particularly useful to carry around all the time, and certainly not to wear all the time.  Polymorph control, worn by itself, can spare you the headaches associated with [[polymorph trap]]s (such as armor destruction) if you do not already have [[magic resistance]].

The essential rings are not ''absolutely'' necessary to ascend, but they make it a lot easier. Free action protects you from paralysis when fighting high level spellcasters (and so should be worn throughout the [[end game]]). Levitation allows you to easily cross several water levels, as well as the planes of Air and Fire. (Levitation on the Plane of Water is no longer effective as of version 3.6.) Finally, conflict causes you 50% extra hunger, but will save your life many times over in a heavy fight, as well as give you an easier, faster path through crowds of monsters.

Wearing a '''ring of cold resistance''' conveys the [[cold resistance]] extrinsic.

== Identification ==

Dropping a ring of cold resistance into a [[sink]] produces the message, "The cold water faucet flashes brightly for a moment."

A ring of cold resistance is usually used to help obtain intrinsic cold resistance, since most monsters that convey cold resistance have powerful cold attacks (like [[blue jelly|blue jellies]] and [[winter wolf|winter wolves]]).

&&%s&& %s Random number generator {140284 2021-05-25T18:53:07Z {4000978 Aximili} add category:development {{wikipedia|Pseudorandom number generator}}
NetHack uses a '''random number generator''' ('''RNG''') to determine the outcome of in-game events. Probabilities are expressed in [[d notation]], a homage to [[Dungeons and Dragons]].

==Deification==

The RNG is sometimes referred to as the Random Number God. The RNG plays a pivotal role in determining the fate of all characters, and is sometimes considered the deadliest enemy in the game, despite the fact that expert players such as [[marvin]] have demonstrated that nearly every game is [[ascension|ascendable]].

==Technical details==

Although NetHack relies on the C '''rand()''' function, random number generation is not as straightforward as picking a number between 0 and n. [[Rnd.c]] holds all of the game's RNG functions, which can return results that depend on your [[Luck]] or [[experience level]]. [[Source diver]]s might profit from examining these functions.

==Misuse==
===3.4.3===
It was found by Adeon that a sufficiently determined player can find the seed of RNG after starting the game and then use it to his or her advantage - [https://s3.amazonaws.com/altorg/dumplog/Adeon/1236028477.nh343.txt for example to gain unlimited number of wishes from a fountain]. For demonstration see his ttyrecs on NAO from 2009-02-28 (starting with http://alt.org/nethack/trd/?file=http://alt.org/nethack/userdata/A/Adeon/ttyrec/2009-02-28.10:31:15.ttyrec.bz2#).

Instead of taking the current time in seconds as seed, NAO has after this exploit been [https://github.com/altorg/NetHack/blob/3.4.3-nao/src/hacklib.c#L480 changed to read the seed from the operating system's own pseudorandom number generator '/dev/urandom']. This way the seed has become unpredictable.

To also complicate the deducing of the random number generator's internal state, [https://github.com/altorg/NetHack/blob/3.4.3-nao/src/rnd.c#L21 periodic reseeding has been implemented].

&&%s&& %s Gender {145059 2022-03-26T17:28:03Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  In ''[[NetHack]]'', when creating your character, you may choose a '''gender''': '''male''' or '''female'''. You may also specify a default gender via the [[options#gender|gender option]] in your configuration file. You can check your current and initial gender with {{kbd|ctrl|x}}, which shows your [[base attributes]].

==Description==
Your choice of gender affects a number of events in the game:

* Female characters can lay [[egg]]s when polymorphed into a monster that lays eggs.
* Any eggs found and carried by male characters have a 50/50 chance of hatching tame. Eggs found and carried by females never hatch tame. (Eggs laid by you always hatch tame, regardless of your current gender.)
* Male characters are seduced by the [[succubus]], and female characters are charmed by the [[incubus]]. During seduction, incubi will put a [[ring of adornment]] on your hand if you have one, while succubi will steal them.
* Various messages will be slightly different depending on your gender, but with no effect on gameplay mechanics.

The [[Valkyrie]] is the only class that can only start as female, although any character's gender can be changed with an [[amulet of change]].

Monsters can be gendered (including '''neuter'''), but this affects only the pronoun used to relate their actions.

==Variants==
===NetHack brass===
In [[NetHack brass]], female characters dressed as nurses can apply [[bandage]]s in fewer turns than male characters. Female characters wearing "maid armor" (i.e. the [[maid dress]], [[frilled apron]], and [[katyusha]]) gain various benefits, while male characters will instead gain the [[aggravate monster]] property.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], [[Yeomen]] always start as male.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], the player's interactions with succubi and incubi are not determined by their gender, but instead by their sexuality. Additionally, players may elect to play as nonbinary. A nonbinary player character is unique in the following ways:

* Nonbinary characters are more likely to receive armor removal prompts when being seduced by a monster.
* Nonbinary characters can't lay eggs.
* Eggs that hatch in the inventory of a nonbinary character always produce peaceful monsters.
* Nonbinary characters cannot be seduced by succubi or incubi, unless the player character is bisexual.

Wearing an '''amulet of strangulation''' quickly strangles you to death, unless you are headless or both [[breathless]] and [[mindless]],{{refsrc|mondata.c|354|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} in six turns.{{refsrc|do_wear.c|733|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} Removing it nullifies the effect; however, most of these amulets are generated cursed.

==Generation==
There is a 13.5% chance that a randomly-generated amulet will be an amulet of strangulation. This amulet is generated cursed 90.5% of the time, uncursed 9% of the time, and blessed 0.5% of the time. There is a guaranteed amulet of strangulation on the middle level of [[Vlad's Tower]]. 

==Identification==
This amulet auto-identifies when worn.

==Messages==
The messages in the ''Alt. message'' column occur when you are [[breathless]], and 2% of the time when you aren't.{{refsrc|timeout.c|245|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

==Strategy==
This amulet is dangerous, and one of (if not ''the'') main reasons you should not put on amulets without knowing their [[BUC]] status. If cursed, you can [[pray]] (assuming it is safe) to have it destroyed. If you find a noncursed amulet of strangulation, though, it can be easily identified and taken off. Being strangled renders you unable to cast spells, so don't rely on the {{spell of|remove curse}} spell to save you.

[[Eating jewelry|Eating this amulet]] has a {{frac|19|20}} chance of choking you to death immediately, unless you are [[breathless]].

If it is cursed and you have a [[wand of cancellation]], you can zap yourself to uncurse the amulet and then safely remove it. This also affects all other items in your inventory, so if you have time you may want to drop everything except the wand of cancellation and then zap yourself.

If you do manage to get the amulet off, your [[strength]] is still abused.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and derived variants, the amulet is always deadly when worn. Being [[breathless]] saves you from choking whiles eating the amulet, but not from wearing it.

The inability to cast spells while wearing one is introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].

The '''potion of paralysis''' causes [[paralysis]].

==Effects==

Quaffing it will paralyze you; 13-22 turns if blessed, 25-34 turns if uncursed, and 37-46 turns if cursed. Breathing the vapors from a potion of paralysis that shatters near you will paralyze you for 1-5 turns. Like most forms of paralysis, having [[free action]] makes this potion harmless.

Potions of paralysis may be thrown at monsters or wielded and smashed on their head. Both methods paralyze the monster for 1-25 turns (the potion's [[beatitude]] doesn't affect this). If the monster is already paralyzed, the potion doesn't increase the duration; it just has no effect.{{refsrc|potion.c|1070}} Other than that, monsters cannot resist this paralysis in any way.

Monsters may also throw these at you, but this only causes paralysis for the 1-5 turns from inhaling the vapors.{{refsrc|potion.c|1267}}

Though this is a harmful potion, dipping a [[unicorn horn]] in it does not convert it to water.

== Strategy ==
This potion can be a great way to take down a powerful monster such as a [[quest nemesis]], a [[demon lord]], or the [[Wizard of Yendor]].

Missing with a thrown potion wastes it, unlike a wielded one. However, smashing one in melee will make you inhale the vapors, so this is dangerous unless you have [[free action]] or are polymorphed into a monster that is both [[breathless]] and [[eyeless]].{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|1983|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

A '''bell''' is a [[musical instrument]]. It does not play notes; its function is to ring.

== Generation ==

Bells are often found on [[grave]]s reading "Saved by the bell!"{{refsrc|mklev.c|1394}} All bells are generated uncursed.

Unlike [[horn]]s, [[harp]]s, and [[flute]]s, there are no randomly-generated magical bells. The only magical bell in the game is the [[Bell of Opening]], which has the distinct appearance of "''silver bell''".

== Effects ==

Ringing a blessed or uncursed bell makes [[noise]] (waking nearby monsters) and calls [[pet]]s. A cursed bell, however, has a {{frac|4}} chance of summoning a [[nymph]] (she won't be carrying any items), assuming none of the nymphs are [[genocide]]d or [[extinct]]. If a nymph is summoned, the bell has a 7% chance of breaking (the [[Bell of Opening]] never breaks). If the bell doesn't break, then with equal probability:

* there may be no effect;
* the summoned nymph may be fast; or
* the player may be paralyzed for 2 turns.{{refsrc|apply.c|771}}

Bells have very little use in most games, and they are quite heavy, so they are rarely worth keeping.

Complete your ascension kit before taking on the [[Wizard of Yendor]]. 

This page contains some common suggestions for ascension kit components. You will not need everything on this page (many of the items listed are mutually exclusive), but unless attempting an unofficial [[conduct]], you should make sure that you collect items to cover all the major attributes listed above.

==Common items==
===Armor===

====Cloak====

*[[Cloak of magic resistance]]: Provides [[magic resistance]], [[magic cancellation]] 1, and 1 AC. Magic resistance is necessary in the endgame, and the quest artifact is unreliable as the Wizard may steal it.
*[[Cloak of displacement]]: Provides [[displacement]], [[magic cancellation|MC]]1 and 1 AC. Displacement helps keep you from being surrounded by making monsters waste moves attacking empty space.
*[[Robe]]: Provides enhanced spellcasting, [[magic cancellation|MC]]2, and 2 AC. Commonly combined with [[GDSM]] and an [[amulet of reflection]], or [[SDSM]] and a wished-for [[quest artifact]] that provides [[magic resistance]].
*[[Cloak of protection]]: Gives [[magic cancellation|MC3]] by itself, and 3 AC, but does not provide the special benefits of the above cloaks. Should be [[erodeproof]]ed to protect its natural AC bonus.
*[[Oilskin cloak]]: Renders you immune to drowning attacks on the [[Plane of Water]] (in other places, simply do not stand next to water until you have verified all the eels are dead); however, carrying escape items such as a [[wand of cold]] or [[wand of teleportation]] will largely mitigate this risk.

If you have magic resistance and reflection, any cloak is good enough. Greasing the cloak will protect from grabbing and drowning attacks until the grease wears off.

====Body armor====

[[Dragon scale mail]], usually silver or grey: This provides either reflection or magic resistance, 9 base points of [[AC]], and does not hinder spellcasting. [[Yellow dragon scale mail]] is another lesser possibility as it provides [[acid resistance]], which cannot be gained intrinsically.

High-level [[Monk]]s with high Luck can hit accurately enough to overcome the &minus;20 to-hit penalty for wearing body armor.

====Boots====

[[Speed boots]] and [[Spellbook of jumping|jumping spell]], or [[jumping boots]] and [[haste self]] / [[potion of speed]]: Dodge monsters instead of fighting them. You zap [[teleportation]] in your free move to create an alley, then jump through it, ending your turn. 

Jumping is an easier spell to cast than haste self, but casting it repeatedly with the Amulet will drain your power rapidly, and failed casts can waste precious movement opportunities. With jumping boots, you haste yourself with the Amulet at your feet when not in immediate danger, to build up hundreds of turns of the effect, then pick it up and go on your way. Jumping with the boots is not subject to random failure.

For characters who lack access to either spell, extrinsic speed is generally more useful than the ability to jump, which requires clear paths through monster hordes, and conveys no combat advantage.

[[Water walking boots]] are guaranteed in [[Vlad's Tower]], and can be swapped with other boots to easily dilute potions and scrolls.

====Gloves====
*[[Gauntlets of power]] for non-spellcasters: They provide strength 25 (+6 to damage) and 1 point of base AC. Valkyries in particular can use them to throw [[Mjollnir]] and catch it again. 

* [[Gauntlets of dexterity]] or [[leather gloves]] for spellcasters: Either is fine for scenarios where you might need to handle a [[footrice]] corpse. The [[dexterity]] bonus does not matter much if you are at your racial maximum, unless you are a monk with a &minus;20 [[To-hit#Dexterity bonus|to-hit]] penalty from body armor.

Neither gauntlets of power or gauntlets of dexterity are absolutely essential - if you have already found a pair of well-enchanted leather gloves, they will suffice.

====Helmet====
*[[Helm of opposite alignment]]: For switching alignments on the Astral Plane, or reducing the effect of the [[mysterious force]].
*[[Helm of telepathy]]: Gives a limited range of telepathy when not blind.
*[[Helm of brilliance]]: Does not hinder spellcasting and increases [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]] by its enchantment.
*[[Elven leather helm]]: Does not hinder spellcasting, provides base AC 1, and can be safely enchanted up to +7, giving a higher potential AC boost than any other helm. Its weight of 3 is also much less than the others' 50.

Any sufficiently enchanted piece of headgear will do; you should grease it if possible to help protect against [[mind flayer]] attacks.

====Shield====
*[[Shield of reflection]]: If you are not wearing [[SDSM]] or an [[amulet of reflection]], the shield is an ideal choice for protecting your inventory from ray attacks. The shield of reflection is a good choice for non-spellcasters, cannot rust or corrode, and provides 2 base AC.

*[[Elven shield]]: If you already have reliable reflection from one of the other above sources and are not a spellcaster, this may be a good choice. It has a base AC of 2, and can be safely enchanted to +7, giving it the highest generally feasible AC of any shield. It is also the lightest shield out of those with base AC 2.

*[[Small shield]]: Provides 1 base AC, but does not penalize spellcasting as much as other shields.

====Shirt====
*A [[T-shirt]] or [[Hawaiian shirt]] - they are identical in practical terms and lack AC of their own, but both provide an extra piece of armor to enchant for lower AC.

===Rings===
*[[Ring of conflict]]: Makes monsters fight each other instead of you. A minor disadvantage is that the pet guardian [[angel]] on the [[Astral Plane]] will be replaced with some hostile angels if you arrive wearing the ring or wear it in its presence - but they will probably fight each other, and the guardian angel isn't a good pet at this point anyway.
*[[Ring of levitation]]: Players must be levitating or flying to move reliably on the [[Plane of Air]], and the ring is the quickest and most convenient option; levitation is also helpful (but not necessary) on the [[Plane of Fire]]. A single ''blessed'' [[potion of levitation]] will carry you through the [[endgame]] if you lack this specific ring.
*[[Ring of free action]]: Prevents paralysis from a number of sources.
*[[Ring of teleport control]] or other source of [[teleport control]]: Very important if you have [[teleportitis]], and can be used to teleport between staircases on the the ascension run. It is also convenient for easy [[level teleportation]].

===Amulets===
*[[Amulet of life saving]]: If you die while wearing it, you come back with full [[HP]] instead, unless the cause of death would still kill you afterward. While not necessary, this item is quite useful - chiefly, it lets you take on more risk in the Endgame, reducing resource consumption. It also provides limited protection against [[YASD]]s from overconfidence, inattentiveness, typos, and other gameplay blunders.
*[[Amulet of reflection]]: Some playstyles prefer to gain reflection via the amulet&mdash;you may wish to free the left hand for #twoweapon instead of the shield of reflection, or keep a robe to enhance spellcasting while wearing [[GDSM]] for magic resistance.
*[[Amulet of magical breathing]]: Without some way to cross the [[Plane of Water]], you're at the mercy of the bubbles' random movement. Self-[[polymorph]] is a potential(ly risky) alternative. Not recommended without an [[oilskin sack]] to protect your scrolls and potions.

===Tools===
*Blessed [[unicorn horn]]: Can be applied to cure [[sickness]] caused by [[Pestilence]], not to mention all of the status [[ailment]]s you might pick up otherwise. An absolute must.
*[[Towel]] or [[blindfold]]: Put one of these on to [[blind]] yourself for using intrinsic telepathy if you have it, or avoiding blinding and [[stun]]ning from [[Archon]]s. It's a good idea to [[bless]] your towel or blindfold as an extra layer of protection against cursing.
*[[Tooled horn]], [[bugle]] or [[leather drum]]: Any of these instruments can cause monsters to flee from you, which is useful to scare off low MR monsters in the endgame, such as the [[sea monster]]s in the [[Plane of Water]] or the [[air elementals]] in the [[Plane of Air]].
*7 [[candle]]s: These must be attached to the [[Candelabrum]] as part of the [[Invocation Ritual]].
*[[Crystal ball]], mostly only if [[illiterate]]: Apply it (while engulfed) to find the location of the [[portal]]s on the Elemental Planes. Others normally use [[gold detection]].
*[[Sack]], [[oilskin sack]], [[bag of holding]]: To protect items from inventory damage. The bag of holding is the most desirable since it reduces weight.
*[[Magic marker]]s: If you have any left, keep them around to write extra/emergency scrolls.
*[[Light source]]: If you plan to [[jump]] on the Astral Plane, you will need one. The [[Candelabrum]] is ideal to maximize casting the spell at Skilled or Expert; otherwise, any oil-filled [[lamp]] will suffice.

===Wands===
*[[Wand of teleportation]]: Can be zapped (even on [[non-teleport levels]]!) at monsters or objects to make them go away. Very useful when trying to get to a high altar or get rid of air elementals. When surrounded on a [[non-teleport level]], breaking one can give you room to maneuver. Zapping a Rider or its corpse will usually move it adjacent to you, but possibly adjacent in the direction you came from.
*[[Wand of death]]: [[Pestilence]], [[Famine]], and the [[Wizard of Yendor]] are all vulnerable to wands of death, as are other [[Endgame]] baddies - [[air elemental]]s, [[player monster]]s, etc. '''''Do not''''' zap [[Riders|Death]] with a wand of death.)
*[[Wand of digging|Wands of digging]]: You will need several wands of digging for the [[Plane of Earth]], and one to raze the doors on the [[Astral Plane]]. [[Pick-axe]]s are much too slow, and the ground there very often forms [[earth elemental]]s when dug. You may need fewer wands if you have the spell of digging.
*[[Wand of secret door detection]]: Very useful for finding the [[secret door]] in [[Moloch's Sanctum]], as well as finding the portal on the [[Plane of Water]], or finding it again on the [[Plane of Air]] if you used a cursed [[scroll of gold detection]].
*[[Wand of cancellation]]: Best kept in a separate bag, it can be used to uncurse a [[bag of holding]] or create blank scrolls and potions of water in an emergency. Can also cancel annoying monsters like [[disenchanter]]s or [[energy vortex|energy vortices]].
*[[Wand of fire|Wands of fire]]: Burn [[Elbereth]] when surrounded by nasties, or cure sliming.
*[[Wand of wishing]]: As long as it has charges (and it will always have at least [[wresting|one]] unless it has been [[cancel]]led), keep it around in case you need any of the other listed items.

===Scrolls===
*[[Scroll of gold detection]]: You want four or more to discover the locations of the portals on the [[Elemental Planes]]. The best solution is to read a scroll of gold detection while [[confused]], which will detect and identify traps. However, it takes a turn to read the scroll, and another turn or more to cure confusion using a [[unicorn horn]]. Confusion usually comes from a forgotten [[spell]], which takes no game-time but can [[stun]] you, or a cursed [[scroll of confuse monster]], a [[potion of confusion]], or a cursed [[unicorn horn]].
: Cursed scrolls of gold detection show all traps as [[$]]. This is useless on the Plane of Fire, which is full of [[trap|fire traps]]. Also, traps detected as gold will vanish from the screen once they are in sight.
: You could also use a [[crystal ball]], but it freezes you for d10 turns and has possible negative effects; you could use a [[wand of secret door detection]] or the unreliable [[Amulet of Yendor]], but it only helps if you are within eight squares of the portal.
*Blessed [[scroll of remove curse]]: Can be useful to uncurse all items in main inventory. Uncursed scrolls only uncurse worn and wielded items.
*Blessed [[scroll of charging]]: In case your wands run out of charges.
*[[Scroll of scare monster]]: An excellent single-turn panic button that works against nearly all monsters. Tip it out of a container or your bag of holding. Since Elbereth does not work in [[Gehennom]], it is the best defense against a gated [[Demogorgon]].
*Cursed [[scroll of genocide]]: Can be used to create cockatrices, which can be killed for their corpses to use as good weapons on the Astral Plane or the Sanctum, or else killing the [[Wizard of Yendor]] in a pinch.
*[[Scroll of blank paper|Scrolls of blank paper]]: To write scrolls with your magic markers, ideally of assorted [[BUC]].

===Weapon===
*[[Weapon]]: You likely want some weapon, unless you are a [[conduct]] player. Most players choose an [[artifact]] weapon. [[Grayswandir]], enchanted to +6 or +7, is usually considered the best. #[[Twoweapon]] with a blessed [[silver saber]] makes it even better. For all characters, any of the [[crowning]] weapons will suffice. Check your role's page (under § Strategy → Late game) for further advice.

===Potions===
*[[Holy water]]: Used to bless items that are unblessed or cursed by the [[Wizard of Yendor]], [[lich]]es, and other foes. While there are a number of techniques for un-cursing your items, holy water is the only convenient route to re-''blessing'' items that you need to be blessed (such as a [[bag of holding]]). It is advisable to carry at least five holy water in your bag.
*Blessed [[Potion of full healing|potions of full healing]]: Quickly restores your hit points by a large amount in case of emergency. It also cures sickness, blindness, and hallucination. A reliable way to cure sickness is vital on the Astral Plane because of the [[Riders]] (read: a blessed [[unicorn horn]] might not be enough).
*[[Potion of paralysis|Potions of paralysis]]: You may [[wield]] the potion and attack in melee against Riders, none of whom resist paralysis. You will need free action to avoid paralyzing yourself.
**A thrown potion has a (Dex/25) chance to hit, which is an appealing option for characters with extremely high dexterity. You will not paralyze yourself unless the target is adjacent. Consider that a death ray has a 65% chance to hit [[Famine]] and [[Pestilence]].
*[[Potion of speed]]: Gives temporary extrinsic speed, excellent for characters without speed boots. Save them for critical end game areas such as the [[Sanctum]], [[Plane of Air]], and the [[Astral Plane]].
*Blessed [[potion of monster detection]]: More powerful than extrinsic telepathy, and useful for locating Riders without blinding yourself.

===Comestibles===
*[[K-ration]]s and [[C-ration]]s: Often dropped by the [[Yendorian Army]], these rations provide 400 and 300 points of nutrition respectively. Both weigh only 10 units and are consumed in only one turn, making them very useful when facing Famine.
*[[Lembas wafer]]s provide 600-1000 points of nutrition each (depending on [[race]]), are eaten in 2 turns, and only weigh 5 units; they can be very effective while still running to the Planes.
*[[Royal jelly]] found in giant [[beehive]]s provides 200 nutrition, but weighs only 2 units and can heal you up to 20 HP at a time when eaten. Non-cursed royal jelly also increases [[strength]] by 1 and heals wounded legs (cursed jelly decreases strength and does not heal wounded legs).
*'''[[Blessed]]''' [[tin]]s of [[nurse]] meat: Consuming one restores you to full hit points, with some advantages and some disadvantages relative to potions of full healing.
**<b>First and foremost, consumption of nurse meat is [[cannibalism]] for human characters!</b>
**Unlike [[potions]], tins never explode or dilute, so are always safe to carry in main inventory, even in such hostile environments as the Plane of Fire. On the other hand, even a blessed tin will take two turns to heal you (one to open and one to consume), which is slower than quaffing a potion in main inventory and no faster than retrieving a potion from a bag before quaffing.
**A non-cursed homemade tin will always provide 50 nutrition, and can cause you to choke to death if you are satiated; this is never the case with a potion.
**Finally, a full healing potion can only restore a maximum of 400 hit points; nurse meat always restores you to your maximum, however high that is (although it is rare to attain or need over 400 hp without alchemy or any farming in the first place).
*[[Lizard corpse]]s: For curing [[stoning]], and can also nullify the effect of the [[new moon]] when carried in open inventory.
*[[Cockatrice egg]]s: if you manage to obtain some, they can make short work of the Wizard and other tough monsters sans the Riders. If you rely on a [[quest artifact]] for [[magic resistance]], this could be your backup plan in case the Wizard manages to steal it - don't forget to pack a [[wand of striking]] to extract your artifact from the [[statue]]. The eggs should be generally used in melee ([[wield]]ed one at a time!), but similarly to potions of paralysis, with very high [[Dexterity]] you can try [[throw]]ing them as well.
*[[Footrice]] [[corpse]]: While perishable, if you get a fresh one just before beginning the ascension run and don't dally, it should last through the [[Sanctum]], greatly simplifying the combat. (Make sure to avoid the guaranteed [[spiked pit]]!) A blessed partly eaten chickatrice corpse is also a common [[Astral Plane]] [[wish]], and you can try to [[reverse genocide]] cockatrices before entering.

===Luck item===
*A blessed [[luck]] item: While usually a luckstone is enough, any blessed [[quest artifact]] that acts as a luckstone will also work (for example, [[The Tsurugi of Muramasa]] or [[The Orb of Fate]]), though these can be stolen.

==Armor combinations==
[[Reflection]] and [[magic resistance]] are considered essential properties for the end game. Other desirable properties are [[amulet of life saving|life saving]], [[displacement]], [[two weaponing]] (when available), and high [[magic cancellation]]. The following table summarizes the tradeoffs:

{|class="wikitable"

==Variants==

===SLASH'EM===

For the most part, the ascension kit in [[SLASH'EM]] stays the same, with some differences.

* If [[two-weaponing]] is possible, wielding two artifact weapons at the same time is allowed.
*[[Amulet of flying]] or [[water walking boots]], due to the new [[create pool]] spell.
*[[Amulet of drain resistance]] or [[deep dragon scale mail]]: Level draining been a more serious threat.
*The [[cloak of magic resistance]] is much more interesting for freeing a slot for the new required resistances. You could enchant an [[elven cloak]] to +7, and then [[upgrade]] it to a cloak of magic resistance. [[Gray dragon scale mail]] loses its appeal. [[Shield of reflection]]. More interesting, for freeing a slot for [[level drain resistance]].
*Less of a priority, [[yellow dragon scale mail]] which provides acid resistance, and [[shimmering dragon scale mail]] which provides [[displacement]], can be useful. YDSM can be useful due to more dangerous acid attacks from [[giant shoggoth]]s, among others.
*A [[robe of power]] or a [[robe of protection]]: Can be upgraded from regular robes. They take the suit slot, and [[dragon scale mail]] interfering with [[spellcasting]] now.
*The [[Hand of Vecna]] provide [[half physical damage]], hungerless [[regeneration]], and [[level drain resistance]] when wielded. You can decide to forfeit [[level drain resistance]] and rely on MC3 and wielding the hand for special cases.
*+7 [[unicorn horn]] or +7 [[Nighthorn]] if lawful. They need to be highly enchanted now to be reliable.
*A [[ring of free action]] has more positive effects.
*A [[magic candle]]: It burns indefinitely and only weights 2.
*An [[assault rifle]] and [[bullet]]s: A more powerful ranged weapon.
*A [[holy wafer]]: Better than [[sprig of wolfsbane]].
*Blessed [[healthstone]]s: They increase health regeneration.

===SporkHack===

One of [[SporkHack]]'s main design goals was to do away with the notion of a clear-cut ascension kit, instead forcing the player to make hard and interesting choices.

For example, the other colors of DSM might be useful as well, due to their secondary effects.

===UnNetHack===

[[UnNetHack]] offers [[chromatic dragon scale mail]], which provides multiple resistances including [[stoning]].

===dNetHack===

The [[Ascension kit (dNethack)|dNethack ascension kit]] is similar to, but more inclusive than, the vanilla ascension kit.

The '''sack''' is the most basic form of [[container]] in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
[[Archaeologist]]s and [[Rogue]]s start with an uncursed sack.

The [[statue]] of [[Perseus]] on [[Medusa's Island]] has a 50% chance of containing a sack.{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|59|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|158|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|276|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|376|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

==Effect==
A sack stores items beyond the 52-character limit, and protects its contents from fire, cold, and many other forms of damage; it is also among the lightest of the containers in the game. However, throwing a sack may break or damage some of its contents; if a sack gets wet (e.g. from falling into a pool), it contents may become wet as well.

== Strategy ==
Sacks are passable for simply carrying and storing more items than usual, and can be [[grease]]d to offer some protection against water damage, but are generally replaced with an [[oilskin sack]] or a [[bag of holding]]; the former keeps items dry without the need for grease, while the latter offers weight reduction (lowering or preventing [[encumbrance]]) and magically protects contents from breakage.

Even once you have one or both of those, sacks still have some uses; they can store emergency items, such as [[holy water]] or a [[scroll of scare monster]], separately from the rest of your items so that you can #[[tip]] them out when needed. The most important of these uses is storing a [[wand of cancellation]], which causes an item-destroying explosion if placed into a bag of holding; the wand may also be used to uncurse a bag of holding if necessary. While an oilskin sack can also work for this purpose, they are redundant since wands are not adversely affected by water, and sacks are generally more common.

In addition, a sack can also be used to contain a bag of holding and protect it against being cursed to begin with. Nested sacks with a bag of holding at the core also offer the possibility of reducing the weight of loot for extra points when you ascend; the risk of an explosion is still possible, albeit with a reduced chance. See [[Bag of holding#Nesting bags of holding|Bag of holding § Nesting bags of holding]] for more on this tactic.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"Now, this third handkerchief," Mein Herr proceeded, "has also four edges, which you can trace continuously round and round: all you need do is to join its four edges to the four edges of the opening.  The Purse is then complete, and its outer surface--"
"I see!" Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted.  "Its outer surface will be continuous with its inner surface!  But it will take time. I'll sew it up after tea."  She laid aside the bag, and resumed her cup of tea.  "But why do you call it Fortunatus's Purse, Mein Herr?"
The dear old man beamed upon her, with a jolly smile, looking more exactly like the Professor than ever.  "Don't you see, my child--I should say Miladi?  Whatever is inside that Purse, is outside it; and whatever is outside it, is inside it.  So you have all the wealth of the world in that leetle Purse!"

A '''scroll of blank paper''' is a type of non-[[magical item|magical]] [[scroll]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It appears as an '''unlabeled scroll''' when unidentified.

==Generation==
In addition to random generation, scrolls of blank paper can be created by [[wet]]ting other scrolls or zapping them with a [[wand of cancellation|wand]] or [[spell of cancellation]].

Two scrolls of blank paper can be found next to a [[throne]] hidden in the locate level of the [[Tourist quest]], and two scrolls of blank paper can be found outside the southernmost island dwelling on the third variant of [[Medusa's Island]].

[[Paper golem]]s leave behind one or more scrolls of blank paper as a special [[death drop]] instead of a [[corpse]].{{refsrc|src/mon.c|418|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Description==
"Reading" a scroll of blank paper simply [[auto-identifies]] it, which does not use up the scroll or violate the [[illiterate]] [[conduct]].

Scrolls of blank paper can be used to write other scrolls with a [[magic marker]] - the [[beatitude]] of the resulting scroll is affected by the beatitude of both the scroll of blank paper and the magic marker:

==Strategy==
{{main|Wet}}
The scroll of blank paper and the [[scroll of enchant weapon]] are the only scrolls with a base cost of 60 [[zm]], making [[price identification]] of the latter trivial.
