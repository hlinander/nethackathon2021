In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''pounding''' is the action of [[apply]]ing a [[polearm]] (including but not limited to [[lance]]s) on a target that is at a distance of exactly two [[square]]s from the wielder.

==Terminology==
This game function was given the name "pounding" by Shawn M. Moore, who gave a thorough description of it in [https://sartak.org/nh/knight-faq-343.html#poleweapons ''The Knight FAQ''].

==Description==
At Basic and Unskilled level, the target must be in a straight line from the wielder. At Skilled level, it can be a [[jumping|knight's jump]] from the wielder. At Expert level the target can also be at a diagonal, meaning that any of the sixteen squares at a distance of two can be hit. Only [[Knight]]s may reach Expert skill level in lance, and no roles can reach expert in polearms. Pounding can scuff [[engraving]]s beneath you, just like attacking in melee.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|2879|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

When [[twoweapon]]ing, the range for pounding is determined by the lesser of your polearm or lance skill and your two-weapon combat skill. This is only possible with a lance, because all other polearms are two-handed. A lance can be used for pounding without any penalty, even when the wielder is not mounted.

Most monsters can only use polearms with a skill level equivalent of unskilled, with the exception of the [[troll]] - all trolls can use them with a skill level equivalent of skilled, meaning they can hit you from a knight's jump away.

==Strategy==
Pounding is an excellent strategy for hitting both melee and ranged targets; if you have adequate [[speed]] and at least Skilled level, you can attempt to kill a group of opponents at a choke point (such as a door) a knight's move away. If you plan on pounding in corridors, though, you will need either a light source or [[infravision]], as you cannot pound a monster you cannot see (even if you can detect it via other means).

In addition, pounding does not trigger [[passive attacks]], meaning you can use it against dangerous creatures without depleting your projectiles or wand charges. Some players like to pound dangerous [[sea monster]]s on levels such as [[Medusa's Island]], the [[Castle]], and the [[Wizard's Tower]] in order to remain safe from their [[drowning attack]]s.

Pounding can also be used for the [[hit and run]] tactic, and is much safer than melee attacks in that respect, especially after 3.6 monster speed changes.

==History==
The feature of pounding scuffing engravings on the square beneath the pounder is introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

&&%s&& %s Adjust {127632 2019-08-31T01:21:12Z {4001313 Ardub23} Minor rewording '''#adjust''' is the [[extended command]] to change the letter that an item in your inventory is stored under. It also allows you to merge and split [[stackable|stacks]] of identical items.

== Splitting stacks ==
As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the #adjust command can take a count, specifying how many items to move from one slot to another. (For example, to split off one half of <span class="nowrap"><tt>a - 10 darts</tt></span>, you can #adjust <tt>5a</tt> to <tt>b</tt>.)

As of [[NetHack 3.6.1]], items/stacks that have been split with the #adjust command will not automatically merge with each other unless dropped and picked up, or stashed and removed from a container. This removes the need to #name individual items to prevent them from stacking.

== Merging stacks ==
If you #adjust an item to its own slot (e.g. adjusting <tt>a</tt> to <tt>a</tt>), any stacks of identical items will be merged into the stack on that slot. (This is useful when [[dip]]ping identical items in {{of|potion|holy water}}&mdash;first merge the stacks, then dip the stack to bless them all at once.)

== Strategy ==
Many players find it useful to #adjust certain useful items to the same slot across games. As an example, consistently having your key in the <tt>k</tt> slot might save you the annoyance of having to look at your inventory every time you wish to unlock a door. It's also a good idea to readjust your inventory slots so as to prevent typos from killing you: keeping a [[food ration]] on <tt>y</tt> might be lethal if you try to eat it while standing above a [[cockatrice corpse]].

Unlike normal quests, the alignment quests do not have quest leaders, nor do you actually have to belong to the alignment in question to attempt the Quest. They are also only one level each. You have to complete at least two of the three alignment quests to get the keys to the indestructible doors in [[Vlad's Tower]].

==Level==

On entering the Chaotic Quest, you will receive the message "You feel deathly cold." Unlike the [[Lawful Quest|Lawful]] and [[Neutral Quest|Neutral]] Quests, the Chaotic Quest does not have a fixed map. Instead, it looks like a standard rooms-and-corridors level with one bigger 14x10 room. The level contains 17 random [[Lich|L]], six random [[Wraith (monster class)|W]], eight random [[V]], and 14 random [[Z]]; eight chests, nine random gems, ten random potions, nine random scrolls, six random spellbooks, and 34 other random items; and seven random traps. 

An example map.

Vecna himself is located in the 14x10 room; on defeat, he will drop the [[Key of Chaos]] and the [[Hand of Vecna]], which is a very powerful item, definitely worth the trouble all the [[Lich|L]] will cause you; it gives you slotless hungerless [[regeneration]] and [[half physical damage]] in addition to its normal [[Hand of Vecna|invoke effect]].

Note that the portal back to the Dungeons of Doom can be generated anywhere on the level, including inside the 14x10 room.

==Tactics==

These tactics are very useful: 

* Have [[fire resistance]]: the random {{white|V}} may include [[fire vampire]]s, who will quickly wipe out any character without it. [[Reflection]] is also important, as it will protect you from the disintegration breath of a summoned black dragon.
* Make sure you have a +4 weapon or extremely powerful spell attacks.  You want to be able to kill Vecna for his hand and key.  Do not disintegrate him or digest him, as this loses you the hand, one of the best items in the game.
* Engrave Elbereth with a wand of lightning or of fire, or drop a scroll of scare monster for the same effect.  Be aware that high-level liches will often generate on the quest, and these may summon [[minotaur]]s and [[couatl]], which ignore Elbereth.  Even if no purple L are generated or they are genocided, Vecna himself can always summon nasties, and at a higher base level than an arch-lich.  Make sure you have a way to deal at least with minotaurs.  Teleportation, taming, sleep and polymorph are all good options, especially the last three since minotaurs have zero [[MR]].
*[[Magicbane]] can be very useful here if you have it. It is considered a +4 weapon to hit, even if its real enchantment is only +0. It can engrave Elbereth in one turn. It also absorbs almost all the curse inventory attacks that the Liches can throw at you. And it also provides magic resistance while wielded.
* Putting on a [[ring of conflict]] can help with the waves of monsters summoned by the Liches.
* Wear [[deep dragon scale mail]], or wield [[Excalibur]], either of which will prevent level drain,&nbsp;but you still have to be quite powerful to survive the waves of enemies.  At the very least, have [[MC]] 3, which will mostly prevent level drain. [[Regeneration]] will help you weather their attacks.
* Genocide&nbsp;: Genociding L/Z/V is very useful&nbsp;: Vampire mages, master/arch-liches, and ghoul queens can easily create fatal summoning storms. Genociding them before entering the quest for the first time will replace them with random monsters, but genociding them after entering the quest for the first time will not do so, and will leave their starting inventories on the ground, which is often more useful, but beware of other monsters using them before you get to them.
* Always have an active means to prevent/survive a fall in the water. Vecna and high-level liches can cast [[create pool|Create Pool]], plunging you into water if you're not flying, levitating, or wearing [[boots of water walking]]. If they've surrounded you with summoned nasties, you won't be able to climb out, resulting in [[instadeath]].

The portal back to the [[Dungeons of Doom]] is marked. The three marked traps are all [[spiked pit]]s; there are also four other random traps. The [[Beholder (monster)#SLASH'EM|Beholder]] occupies the spot marked 'e', along with a chest and four piles of gold. Killing the Beholder will reveal the [[Eye of the Beholder]] and the [[Key of Neutrality]]. There are also 37 [[gas spore]]s scattered throughout the level, as well as four other random e's and/or F's. There is a guaranteed [[fountain]] at the top of the map.

Because of the number of gas spores in this level, killing one can trigger a "domino effect", in which you hit a gas spore in one direction and cause an explosion on the other side of your hero.

==The Beholder==
This monster has multiple [[gaze attack]]s, including one which causes an [[instadeath]]. Fortunately, like all gaze attacks, the death gaze can be reflected with a [[mirror]]. [[Reflection]] will also reflect the gaze of death, killing the Beholder, but only if you are not invisible (or the Beholder is otherwise prevented from seeing you, while you can see it), and it will not protect against the other attacks.

&&%s&& %s Damage {101107 2016-01-14T22:04:25Z {0 } /* See Also */  Remove underscores in page links '''Damage''' in NetHack reduces the current [[hit points]] of the [[monster]] or player that receives it.  If the player or a creature is reduced to 0 or fewer HP, it [[die]]s.  Exception: if [[you]] are a monster (due to [[polymorph]] or [[lycanthropy]]) and you're reduced to 0 or fewer HP, you revert to your original form (unless you are wearing an [[amulet of unchanging]], in which case you die).

Damage can come from a variety of sources, including physical and magical attacks, as well as falling down stairs or onto a sink, stepping on a trap, being hit by a bounced or reflected spell, and many others.

The physical damage [[you]] do can be increased by wearing a [[ring of increase damage]], and decreased by [[erosion]] of the weapon you are using.

Damage from some spells and effects can be reduced or eliminated by having the appropriate [[resistance]], [[magic cancellation]], or [[magic resistance]], or by having the [[half physical damage]] or [[half spell damage]] intrinsics.

The damage that a weapon, attack, or other occurrence can do is often specified in [[D notation]] (e.g. striking with a weapon that does 3d6 damage will deal damage equal to the sum of 3 rolls of a 6-sided die on every successful attack).

&&%s&& %s Haste self {140681 2021-06-03T16:31:22Z {4001463 Actual-nh} Grammar/style There are three related [[object]]s that you can use to increase your [[speed]]. Speed is a [[property]] essential when encountering the more-difficult [[monster]]s in [[melee]]. The three objects are:
* [[spellbook of haste self]]
* [[potion of speed]]
* [[wand of speed monster]]

The spellbook grants a level 3 [[spell]] of the [[escape spell|escape]] school that increases your speed for 100 to 109 [[turn]]s.

If you had [[wounded legs]], then the potion of speed will heal them. (Normally, you can heal your legs just by waiting some turns, so do not waste a potion of speed to heal them except in an emergency!) Otherwise, an uncursed potion will haste you 100 to 109 turns like the spell. A cursed potion will haste you only 40 to 49 turns, but a blessed potion will last 160 to 169 turns.

Ultimately though, if you can find [[speed boots]], then the spell and the potion become redundant. A [[Wizard]] or other good magic user with [[intrinsic]] speed might be able to use the haste self spell while wearing different boots, such as [[jumping boots|jumping]]. Meanwhile, the potion of speed becomes a candidate for [[alchemy]] or dilution to make [[holy water]].

The wand is more useful and important. You can use the [[wand of speed monster]] to give ''permanent'' intrinsic speed to both [[you]]rself and your [[pet]]s. Hasting your pets allows them to hit more often in melee, unless they already have 12 speed; your pets will be stronger because melee is their primary activity (other than [[stealing from shops]] and curse-testing).

Haste self is also a [[monster spell]]; when a monster casts this, they become fast. It produces the message "'''[[Foo]] is suddenly moving faster.'''"

&&%s&& %s Sleep {129561 2019-12-11T10:41:11Z {4000978 Aximili} Add encylopedia entry from 3.6 branch '''Sleep''' is a condition that [[player]]s and [[monster]]s may be affected by in NetHack. While asleep, you are immobilized for a number of turns. [[Sleep resistance]] prevents external magical sources from causing this, though it does not prevent [[fainting]] from lack of food.

Sleep slows down your natural [[hunger]] rate by 90%, though additional hunger sources such as [[conflict]] or [[ring hunger]] are not affected.

While you are asleep, "[[you hear]]" messages become "You dream that you hear".

==Causes==
*Drink or be hit by a [[potion of sleeping]]
*Be zapped by a [[wand of sleep]]
*Be hit by a [[Spellbook of sleep|sleep spell]]
*Wear an [[amulet of restful sleep]]
*Step on a [[sleeping gas trap]]
*Be attacked by a [[homunculus]] or hit by the sleeping [[breath]] of an [[orange dragon]], a [[Nazgul]], or the [[Chromatic Dragon]]. [[Magic cancellation]] wards against the sleep-inducing [[homunculus]] bite.

[[Free action]] prevents sleep from potions of sleeping only.

==Sleeping monsters==
Some of the above events can also affect monsters, and some monsters (notably [[nymph]]s and [[leprechaun]]s) are generated sleeping. Monsters affected by sleep attacks will sleep for a number of turns and then wake up. Those generated asleep will only wake up when you approach (if you do not have [[stealth]]) or attack them.

&&%s&& %s Half spell damage {138146 2021-03-01T04:56:03Z {4001463 Actual-nh} Typo '''Half spell damage''' is an [[extrinsic]] property which halves any [[damage]] taken from spells, as well as halving certain other effects.

This property is conferred by carrying [[the Orb of Detection]], [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]], [[the Orb of Fate]] or [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]]. Carrying more than one of these objects does not further affect spell damage.

==Description==
Half spell damage reduces any damage inflicted from spells by 50%.
