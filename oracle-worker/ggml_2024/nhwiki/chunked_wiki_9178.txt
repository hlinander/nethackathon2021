The Watcher is the "mid boss" of the dwarf noble (Dnb) quest. The main body of the Watcher attempts to remain at least 3 squares from the player at all times, and attempts to avoid being on the same line in order to frustrate ranged attacks. The main body will spawn tentacles with its gaze attack; up to a maximum of 6 swarms of snaking tentacles and 2 long sinuous tentacles will be generated. If the Watcher's main body is killed, all the tentacles die as well.

== Mythology ==
{{wikipedia|Watcher in the Water}}
The Watcher comes from the first part of ''The Lord of the Rings'': ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.  It appears as a mysterious aquatic creature lurking in a pool outside the western entrance to the dwarvish realm of Moria, from which it attacks the main characters (the Fellowship) as they are about to enter.  The encyclopedia entry describes the creature as it grabs Frodo, the protagonist, and tries to drag him underwater.  The name "The Watcher in the Water" comes from a historical account the party discover later, which reveals that the monster also prevented Moria's defenders from escaping through that exit.

Little is known about the exact nature of the creature, as the characters catch only a brief glimpse of it, but the detail of its having tentacles (at least twenty) suggests that it may be some kind of monstrous cephalopod.  The passage describes the Watcher's tentacle as "fingered", which is inconsistent with real-life cephalopods, but this may simply be a metaphor meaning that the tentacle was curled like a finger.

In vanilla NetHack, the passage describing the Watcher is used as the encyclopedia entry for the [[kraken]], implying that the Watcher is assumed to be representative of [[wikipedia:kraken|that legendary creature]], which is usually portrayed as a giant cephalopod. (UnNetHack changes the kraken's encyclopedia entry to an unrelated poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.)

In both UnNetHack and dNetHack, the Watcher appears as a "boss" at the surface end of a series of levels inspired by Moria.

In UnNetHack, weeping angels have attacks that [[drain energy|drain spellcasting energy]], [[life drain|drain experience levels]], and [[level teleport|teleport the victim to another dungeon level]]. All these attacks are affected by [[magic cancellation]].

If two Weeping Angels attack each other under conflict, they will turn to stone ("The weeping angel and the weeping angel are permanently quantum-locked!")

Weeping angels' gaze attack continues even locked in place. It causes d4 damage and ''exercises'' [[intelligence]] (the weeping angel's "reflection in your mind weakens you"), but is completely nullified by reflection (the weeping angel "is covering its face").<ref>https://sourceforge.net/p/unnethack/git/ci/master/tree/src/mhitu.c#l2202</ref>

UnNetHack also includes weeping archangels, which are more powerful than ordinary weeping angels. They are only generated in [[Gehennom]] and [[Sheol]].{{refsrc|src/monst.c|1201|unnethack=1202}}

Weeping archangels become [[extinct]] after seven have been generated.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1273|unnethack=1986}} This is a likely reference to the [[Wikipedia:Seven Archangels|seven archangels]] in some Christian traditions.

In dNetHack, weeping angels won't move while the player character can see them, but move exceedingly fast when unobserved. Despite their fast speed, they make at most one attack per game turn. While they are immobilized from observation, their AC is greatly amplified. They will stay in rooms and not venture into corridors, to avoid forcing the player into a permanent standoff in a dead-end corridor.

Their angel's touch attack teleports the character to a higher dungeon level, and drains experience levels based on how many dungeon levels up the character is moved. The angel's touch attack can be blocked by both teleportation control and drain resistance.

Weeping angels are dangerous to look at, however. Viewing a weeping angel without reflection may inflict weeping angel contamination, in which the remembered image of a weeping angel begins taking over the characters mind, eventually converting them into a new weeping angel. Characters contaminated by a weeping angel gradually lose wisdom to abuse. Once wisdom goes below 3, the character dies and rises from the grave as a new weeping angel.

Weeping angel contamination can be removed by:
*any means of [[curse removal]], such as a scroll, the spell, or an effigy. Using an effigy to remove weeping angel contamination will create another weeping angel next to you.
*a source of [[amnesia]] (though this of course has significant drawbacks and should only be used as a last resort)
*[[Prayer|praying]] on a coaligned altar while in good standing with your deity. Weeping angel contamination is considered a major trouble, but ''only'' while praying on an altar.

During the endgame, weeping angels will enter corridors. Their touch attack also no longer teleports you and is no longer resisted by teleport control.
{{clear}}

==Mythology==
Weeping angels are inspired by a race of creatures from the BBC television series ''[[wikipedia:Doctor Who|Doctor Who]]'', which disguise themselves as inanimate statues in order to prey on the energy of other living creatures. A common method of feeding involves sending their prey into the past. To keep up their disguise, weeping angels in ''Doctor Who'' do not move while observed, but can move rapidly when not being observed.

The weeping angel's method of feeding, and avoidance of moving when observed, have been incorporated into its [[NetHack]] counterparts in various ways.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	Lonely assassins they used to be called. No one quite knows
	where they came from, but they're as old as the universe. Or
	very nearly, and they have survived this long because they
	have the most perfect defense system ever evolved. They're
	quantum locked. They don't exist when they're being observed,
	in the moment they are seen by any other living creature
	they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact that their
	biology, in the sight of any other living thing they literally
	turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course a stone
	can't kill you either, but then you turn your head away.
	Then you blink. And oh yes it can.
|Doctor Who, "Blink"
}}
{{encyclopedia|
	"This whole book, it's a warning about the weeping angels, so
	why no pictures? Why not show us what to look out for?"
	"There was a bit about images. What was that?"
	"Yes. Hang on.... 'That which holds the image of an angel
	becomes itself an angel.'"
|Doctor Who, "The Time of Angels"

&&%s&& %s Town {148052 2022-09-02T19:33:02Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* DynaHack */* The '''Town''' is a dungeon [[branch]] that appears in [[UnNetHack]], [[DynaHack]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. It pays homage to the Town found at the top levels of [[Angband]].

==Generation==
The Town branch can be accessed via an up staircase that always appears on the floor after the level containing the entrance to [[Sokoban]].

[[Shopkeeper]]s generated in the town area start with {{frac|4}} of the money of regular shopkeepers, due to this particular town being on the poor side.<ref>[https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/blob/6.0.3-20210525-e2dafd6/src/shknam.c#L599 UnNetHack shknam.c, line 599]; [https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/e55b2b522cea66b463dd8a81d74f9b8ad7fa7bb3/src/shknam.c#L569 SlashTHEM shknam.c, line 569]</ref>

==Description==
The precise layout of the branch depends on the variant.

===UnNetHack===
In UnNetHack, the branch consists of only two floors:

* The first floor is a large, open filler level with three wide rivers, requiring a method of crossing water to reach the town.
* The second floor is the actual town.

===SlashTHEM===
In SlashTHEM, the branch has three floors:

* The first floor is a room-and-corridors filler level.
* The second floor contains the actual town.
* The third floor is a [[#Village map|village]] with a river running through it.

===DynaHack===
DynaHack has a three-floor structure similar to SlashTHEM, though the first two floors use the same town and open filler maps as UnNetHack; in addition, [[Aphrodite]] and the [[nymph level]] can be encountered on the room-and-corridors filler level.

==Town map==
The layout of the town and the generation of the shops within are relatively similar across variants - some primary differences are that SlashTHEM and DynaHack randomize the placement of the stairs and shop doors, and SlashTHEM has an additional up stair to the third floor. The town also has its own [[watch]] patrolling the area - both versions will generate four watchmen and three watch captains.

A randomly placed [[sink]] appears in both possible layouts in order to prevent the game becoming [[unwinnable]] as a result of [[cursed]] sources of [[levitation]] (i.e., a [[ring of levitation|ring]] or [[levitation boots|boots]]); this was imported to UnNetHack from DynaHack.<ref>[https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commit/4ea2dd0da93e75ce67a356dc77b015c45d53445b UnNetHack commit 4ea2dd0: Added a random sink to the Town surface (from DynaHack)]</ref>

The village encountered in SlashTHEM is derived from the Pleasant Valley level in [[Gehennom (Lethe patch)#The Pleasant Valley|the Lethe Patch's revised Gehennom]].<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/dat/village.des#L10 SlashTHEM village.des, line 10]</ref> The caverns, huts and the southwestern tower are all unlit. Randomly scattered around the village are four [[raven]]s, four [[monkey]]s, a [[fox]] and a [[coyote]], along with five random [[comestible]]s and five other random objects.

The player enters the level from the marked stairway in the northwestern cavern. Outside of the cave is a wood area with several trees, three [[pit]]s and a [[squeaky board]]. Two [[bard (player monster)|bards]] and two [[musician (player monster)|musicians]] may appear within this area - each monster has an independent 50% chance of generating.

On the eastern end of the map is a field with two [[wood nymphs]] and a [[brownie]], and a shallow area in the river with two water nymphs - all of them will be generated asleep at their marked locations. The field also contains various peaceful animals - five [[sheep]], three [[lamb]]s, three [[chicken]]s, two [[goat]]s, and a [[cow]]. The four huts to the north each contain a [[peasant]], while four of the five eastern huts contain a peasant, a [[Healer (player monster)|healer]], a [[warrior (player monster)|warrior]], and a [[Priest (player monster)|priest]] - there is also an 80% chance of a [[gypsy]] named Shirley occupying the remaining hut.

The tower in the southwest is home to a group of thieves and their guards, all generated asleep on level creation. Outside the tower are seven [[magic trap]]s and three [[spiked pit]]s. There are three [[wolves]] and a [[werewolf]] acting as 'guard dogs' inside the entrance hall, along with an [[anti-magic field]] placed in front of the tower entrance.

The second room contains the group of thieves, with a [[street thug leader]] named Goda<ref>Derived from Takeshi Gouda of ''[[wikipedia:Doraemon|Doraemon]]''</ref><ref name="thugnames">[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/dat/village.des#L131 SlashTHEM village.des, line 131]</ref> occupying a [[throne]] flanked by two [[street thug]]s named Tonzura and Boyakky,<ref>Based on the two henchmen from the Doronbo Gang of ''[[wikipedia:Yatterman|Yatterman]]''</ref><ref name="thugnames"/> and three [[mugger]]s and a [[bandit]] lined up on each side of them. There is a secret door in the lowest-right section that opens into a hallway with a [[gold golem]], which leads to a small room with a [[wood golem]] - the golem is generated on the same square as a chest and a pile of loot (representing the villagers' stolen belongings they were guarding).

The loot piled around the chest includes three gems - an [[obsidian]], [[jade]] and [[agate stone]] - as well as a random amount of gold, a random [[tool]], [[weapon]], [[armor]], and a [[potion]]. Thirteen other objects are spread around the room, and the chest itself may contain any of several items derived from various popular franchises, some of which are known for their dubious quality:

* a blessed +3 [[silver long sword]] named [[wikipedia:The Legend of Zelda|The Master Sword]] (5%)
* a blessed +5 [[plate mail]] named [[wikipedia:Dragon Quest|Erdrick's Armor]] (5%)
* a blessed +4 [[mallet]] named [[wikipedia:Ranma ½|Tendo Mallet]] (5%)
* a blessed +2 [[broadsword]] named [[wikipedia:Chrono Trigger|Grandleon]] (5%)

In addition to being randomly generated, if you hit a [[tree]] with some form of death attack, it will wither and become a dead tree.

When kicking the tree, there is a 1/5 chance of disturbing an angry [[raven]], a 1/5 chance of knocking down the tree, a 1/5 chance of hurting your foot, and a 2/5 chance of simply displaying a message. 


If an angry raven has already appeared from this tree, you instead have a 1/4 chance of hurting your foot, a 1/4 chance of knocking down the tree, and a 1/2 chance of simply displaying a message.

For most purposes (trying to engrave, gremlin multiplication, damage to iron golems...) the muddy swamp works just like water.

You can't drown in a bog, but you can get "stuck in the mud".

Bogs are most commonly encountered within the swamp special room.

Frequently encountered in the [[Dragon Caves]].

One particularly nasty aspect of getting stuck in a muddy swamp is that you have a 20% chance of your inventory getting wet (trap.c, line 4350)!

'''The Dragon Caves''' are a new branch in [[UnNetHack]], brought over from [[NetHack brass]] R/S. They can be accessed by a stairway from the main dungeon in [[Gehennom]] and, in UnNetHack, from a [[portal]] in the [[Valley of the Dead]]. 

==Level Generation==
The terrain in The Dragon Caves is not randomly generated; each floor has the same layout every playthrough. Monsters, loot, and stair placement, however, is randomized.

Each level in The Dragon Caves features a large number of [[dragon]]s and some [[worm]]s, as well as [[tree]]s and the new [[muddy swamp]] {{green|≈}} : muddy swamps [[wet]]s objects like [[moat]]s do, but don't carry the risk of [[drowning]] and can be crossed without [[levitating]], [[flying]], or [[water walking]] if you’re willing to take water damage. The new [[Chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)|Chromatic Dragons]] (not to be confused for the [[Chromatic Dragon|caveman quest nemesis]]) can be found on the final level of this branch, and their [[Chromatic dragon scale mail|scales]] grant the bonuses of almost all other [[dragon scale mail]]s, plus [[petrification]] resistance, ''but not [[magic resistance]]'' . All levels are [[Light|dark]], can be flipped horizontally and/or vertically, and, except for the final one, allow [[teleport|teleporting]] .

All of the levels before the bottom level have the stairs (and for the top level, the portal to the valley), seventeen [[D]], four [[w]], four [[trap]]s, three [[gem]]s, a [[tool]], and three other random objects scattered around the level.

===Level 4===
Three [[Chromatic dragon (UnNetHack)|Chromatic Dragons]] wait at the bottom of The Dragon Caves, guarding a stash on the opposite side of the level where the player enters from. The large river separating the player from the Chromatic Dragons necessitates finding a way to cross water if the player wants to reach the dragons and their stash. The stash is blocked by a [[boulder]] and each space in it contains 600 + 10d100 [[gold]], a gem, a [[ring]] (80%), an [[amulet]] (40%), and a [[potion]] [[Potion of gain level|of gain level]], [[Potion of gain ability|gain ability]], [[Potion of full healing|full healing]], or  [[Potion of enlightenment|enlightenment]] (60%) with the exception of the top space, which only has a gem and 600 + 12d100 gold. There are also piles of coins under the boulder and around the entrance of the stash, which will likely be picked up by the Chromatic Dragons by the time you meet them.

In addition to the stash and Chromatic Dragons, there are also 22 D, 6 w, and 4 traps scattered throughout the level, in addition to 2d10 piles of 1d100 gold, 12 gems, 3 tools, weapons, potions, and scrolls, and 5 random objects.

==Notes==
As dragons qualify for [[defensive item]]s and [[miscellaneous item]]s, are a high level, and many are generated in The Dragon Caves, this branch can be an excellent source of scrolls and potions (especially potions of full healing) simply because of all the loot the dragons themselves carry. The vast quantities of gold and jewelry, and the Chromatic Dragons themselves, are a bonus for going further into the branch. The immense number of dragons, of course, makes [[reflection]] a necessity if one even wants to consider coming into these caves, unless they want to get [[disintegration|disintegrated]].

There's about a 30% <!-- 29.63% to be exact --> chance that none of the three chromatic dragons drop their scales.  The player is advised to stock up on [[wand of undead turning|wands of undead turning]] to slightly increase her odds.

You can install mediawiki locally, but it's quite a bother. You can also use the dump directly with a reader.

*[http://xowa.org/home/wiki/Help/Download_XOWA.html xowa] (multiplatform)

Currently, what you need to do, in order to setup xowa to use NetHackWiki.

You download the dumps. You import it, the name of the folder the dump is in, will be used as the name for the wiki. Don't test it after you import it, because by default, it will try to use the commons of wikipedia.

To setup the images go in "home/wiki/Help:Options/Config_script"
And add a script like this (with your paths and your wikiname)
<nowiki>
app.wikis.get('WikiName').files.wkrs.get('fs.dir') {
        orig_dir        = '~{<>xowa_root_dir<>}/wiki/WikiName/images/';
        thumb_dir       = '~{<>xowa_root_dir<>}/wiki/WikiName/images/thumb/';
}
</nowiki>

Restart, and it should work as expected. If you have problems ask for help in the forum.

The tty maps will not work however, because NetHackWiki uses a custom plug in for these.

The '''evil eye''' is a new monster introduced in [[UnNetHack]]. It is a physically harmless monster in the same class as a [[floating eye]], but it possesses a [[luck]]-stealing gaze. The luck-stealing gaze is not protected against by [[magic resistance]] but if you have a blessed luckstone, you will resist the effect 75% of the time.

Hitting an evil eye with a cursed [[luckstone]] will heal it, and hitting it with a blessed luckstone will kill it in one hit. Holding up a mirror to an evil eye will [[cancel]] it and cause it to flee, as long as it is not [[blind]], [[invisible]], [[asleep]], or already cancelled.

The evil eye has been added to the list of monsters that can be summoned by the monster spell [[summon nasties]]. It can also be created if a player has attempted but purposefully violated [[Zen]] conduct.

==Corpse==

Eating an evil eye corpse also has an impact on luck:
*A blessed corpse (or tin) will increase your luck by 1-3 points: "You feel more fortunate"
*An uncursed corpse (or tin) will change your luck by -1, 0, +1, +2: "You feel your fortunes in flux"
*A cursed corpse (or tin) will decrease your luck by 1-3 points: "You feel less fortunate"

As of commit r1953, evil eye corpses cannot be tinned (just like [[wraith]]s).

The '''dungeon fern''' is an unassuming monster appearing originally in [[UnNetHack]], though versions of it have also been incorporated into [[dNetHack]] and [[SlashTHEM]].  It is [[sessile]] and has no physical attacks.  However, when approached, it creates '''dungeon fern spores''', the more dangerous cousins of [[gas spore]]s.

Dungeon fern spores attack their targets directly by bursting into [[stinking cloud]]s.  The explosion itself does no harm to the target, and the dangerous effects of the cloud are entirely mitigated by [[poison resistance]] or [[unbreathing]].  If you do not have either of these, standing at a diagonal to the spore when it bursts will give you a significant chance of being outside of the cloud when it forms.  Attacking directly ''will'' cause the spore to explode properly, just like a gas spore.

Exploding dungeon fern spores have a 1 in 3 chance of creating a new fern.  There is a 1 in 6 chance that it will be a full-grown dungeon fern;{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1769|unnethack=1986}} otherwise, it will be a '''dungeon fern sprout''', a lower-level dungeon fern which produces spores at a lower rate.  It is important to destroy both kinds of ferns quickly unless you possess the means to contain out-of-control growth.

Dungeon fern spores will target other monsters as well as the player, and in turn other monsters [[Grudge|will attack fern spores on sight]].{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1340|unnethack=1986}} A careful player can take advantage of this and lure spores toward otherwise difficult monsters without poison resistance.

==UnNetHack==
In UnNetHack, ferns are part of the {{white|F}} monster class, which is defined (according to the [[what is]] and [[farlook]] commands) as "fungus, mold, or fern". UnNetHack features four different species of fern: the regular dungeon fern, the arctic fern, the blazing fern, and the swamp fern. The main differences among the four species are the types of damage caused by their exploding spores, and the terrain in which they can reproduce.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1780|unnethack=1986}}

===Dungeon fern===
The regular dungeon fern produces spores that deal physical damage when they explode.  These spore explosions can produce new ferns and sprouts on [[floor]] and [[muddy swamp]] tiles.

===Arctic fern===
The '''arctic fern''' ({{brightblue|F}}) resists [[cold]] damage, and its spores ({{blue|e}}) deal cold damage when they explode.  New arctic ferns and sprouts can only grow on [[water]], [[ice]], or [[muddy swamp|swamp]] tiles.

===Blazing fern===
The '''blazing fern''' ({{orange|F}}) resists [[fire]] damage, and its spores ({{red|e}}) deal fire damage when they explode.  New blazing ferns and sprouts can only grow on [[lava]] tiles.

===Swamp fern===
The '''swamp fern''' ({{cyan|F}}) produces spores ({{yellow|e}}) that deal physical damage when they explode, like the dungeon fern.  However, they will only produce new swamp ferns and sprouts on [[muddy swamp|swamp]] tiles.

In the [[Ruins of Moria]], there is a 25% chance that a fraction of the tiles on the Forest level will be swamp.  If so, four swamp ferns will be generated throughout the level.{{refsrc|dat/moria.des|392|unnethack=1986}}

===Fern spore===
In UnNetHack, reading a blessed [[scroll of stinking cloud]] while confused will generate up to three nonspecific '''fern spores''' ({{brown|e}}), which can produce any of the four species of ferns, on appropriate terrain. (Reading a non-blessed scroll produces [[gas spore]]s instead.{{refsrc|src/read.c|1615|unnethack=1986}}) These spores are not otherwise randomly generated.

==Other variants==

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], dungeon ferns are part of the [[Plant (dNetHack)|plant]] class, which uses the {{white|<nowiki>{</nowiki>}} glyph.

Two types of ferns appear as monsters in dNetHack, along with their respective spores and sprouts: the dungeon fern and the swamp fern (here {{brightmagenta|<nowiki>{</nowiki>}}). The former is identical to its UnNetHack counterpart, but the explosion of the dNetHack swamp fern spore ({{magenta|e}}) deals [[D notation|4d8]] damage instead of 2d4, and causes fungal [[disease]]s.

===SlashTHEM===

In [[SlashTHEM]] they use the {{white|%}} glyph, like the [[evil food]] monsters from SLASH'EM.

{{todo|Any other differences in SlashTHEM?}}

==Origin==
Ferns are a group of real plants with characteristic leaves. They are primitive, having neither seeds nor flowers; they reproduce with spores, hence the spore attack in the game.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
These dreadful weeds have been driven to extinction on the
surface, yet deep within the dark and damp of the dungeon
they still flourish. When it detects the motion of nearby
creatures, the dungeon fern releases a deadly, poisonous
spore, which quickly detonates to propagate the species.

Residents of the dungeon have learned how not to disturb
the dungeon fern, and will attack its spores on sight to
keep them from overtaking their home.

It is twice as fast at digging through walls, and is the only thing that can dig through [[crystal ice wall]]s other than fire. In addition, the crystal pick is lighter than a regular pick-axe, and does impressive damage for a one-handed weapon. 

A crystal pick is made of [[metal]], not [[glass]]. Like silver polish, steak sauce, or baby powder, its name indicates its intended use rather than its composition. Crystal picks do not rust or corrode.

'''Uranium imps''' are a new [[minor demon]] added in [[UnNetHack]]. When a uranium imp is hit in melee, both the imp and the attacker are teleported together to a random location on the same level, so a fight with one can lead to hopping all over the level. A player with [[teleport control]] can sometimes choose the destination, but will still be accompanied there by the uranium imp. This power is nullified on [[non-teleport level]]s.

==Strategy==

Uranium imps don't deal dangerous amounts of damage, but their teleportation can land an unsuspecting player in a dangerous situation. Additionally, they can very easily separate adventurers from their [[pet]]s.

[[Teleport control]] isn't a perfect defense against the teleportation ability; {{frac|4|13}} of the time, the teleportation will be "too chaotic to control" and the location will be random despite teleport control. The {{frac|4|13}} chance is a reference to the source material for uranium imps&mdash;the number 413 keeps showing up throughout the story.

However, you don't have to fight them&mdash;if you #chat with them, they will run away for 10&ndash;30 turns. This is a reference to the uranium imp's source material, [[wikipedia:Homestuck|''Homestuck'']], in which a bunch of imps are "defeated" by the main character yelling at them to leave. The source code acknowledges this reference with a comment "/* That is IT. EVERYBODY OUT. You are DEAD SERIOUS. */" before defining the fleeing behavior.

==Encyclopedia==

{{Encyclopedia|
Despite being imbued with reality-warping powers by the Green Sun, these trouble-making servants of darkness seem unaware of their true power, and probably would run away if yelled at.

GG: those stupid things are impossible to kill :(
TG: no you can kill them
TG: youll get better dont worry

&&%s&& %s Nymph level (UnNetHack) {92446 2015-02-21T18:47:29Z {4000416 Ozymandias}  The Nymph Level is a special level that exists in [[UnNetHack]].

It has a 45% chance of appearing somewhere between levels 5 and 15.

It contains 6 rooms connected by random corridors.

The rooms are as follows:
* 2 rooms with a squeaky board trap, one random trap, one random item, and a random hostile nymph
* 1 room with a squeaky board trap, two random items, and a random hostile nymph
* 1 room with a squeaky board trap, one random trap, one random item, one random hostile nymph, and the [[Staircase|downstairs]]
* 1 room with a squeaky board trap, one random item, one random hostile nymph, and the [[Staircase|upstairs]]
* Aphrodite's room, which is an unlit room, containing:
** 2 squeaky board traps
** 4 chests
** 4 random rings
** 5 random gems
** 4 random items
** 5 random hostile nymphs
** [[Aphrodite]]

In addition, some of the rooms might contain [[tree]]s. Due to the [[Dungeon Growths]] [[patch]], by the time the player has entered the ascension run, this level can potentially be somewhat overgrown, impeding movement.

One thing to watch out for on this level is that your items will get stolen very easily, and you can end up spending many many turns chasing down nymphs to try to recover your inventory. Nymphs are often generated sleeping, but combat is noisy in [[UnNetHack]] and can wake sleeping monsters. To make matters worse, the various squeaky board traps scattered throughout the level make it very easy to accidentally wake up the nymphs.

If you have [[telepathy]] and a source of [[blindness]] (preferably a [[towel]] or [[blindfold]]), you can easily track down the nymphs and take your possessions back, be careful however that they may steal your towel, render you unable to use telepathy at all. To avoid the frustrations, a strategy is to detect their location using telepathy then use [[ ranged attack]] to dispatch them with haste before they have a chance to come close.

It can be dug through in half the time of a regular wall (although a [[Wand of digging]] will be completely ineffective), and can easily be melted.

These should not be confused with [[Crystal ice wall]]s, also found in Sheol, that cannot be dug through without a [[crystal pick]].

When removed, it leaves behind a square of ice.
Despite being made of ice, it blocks vision just like a normal wall.

&&%s&& %s Random vault (UnNetHack) {145343 2022-04-03T23:14:03Z {4000978 Aximili} fix title '''Random vaults''' are a part of the level generation formula used in [[UnNetHack]]. Despite the name, these are entirely unrelated to the hidden [[vault]]s filled with gold, and are used to create unique rooms that connect normally to the rest of the dungeon.

In the UnNetHack source code, the random vaults are defined in <code>dat/vaults.des</code>. The upcoming release of [[NetHack 3.7.0]] will have a similar feature, called [[themed room]]s.

==Description==
Every room that is not a vault or part of a special level and not a vault is selected from the list of random vaults. The "normal random room" has a {{frac|40|41}} chance of being selected; all the others have a {{frac|2050}} chance of being selected. Some of these rooms can be further transformed into [[special room]]s.
