Now I'll be grateful for any option that resolves the eye-sight strain (I do prefer the regular ASCII for NetHack.exe :/)or quickens the start-up (defaulting the workable 12x16, fit to screen option) of a NetHackW.exe game. {{unsigned|75.121.236.187|22:29, 10 July 2009}}

:Hello there! You could run NetHack in full screen mode. Just run NetHack.exe and hit {{kbd|alt|enter}}. :) The same command also returns the game into a window.
:If you'd prefer to run the game in a window you should create a shortcut for NetHack.exe, right-click it and select Properties. Then from the Font tab you can choose any font, such as that 12x16. From the Options tab you can also make the game ''start'' in the full screen mode. Hope this helps. :) &mdash;[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] (<small>[[User talk:ZeroOne|talk]]</small>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<small>[[Special:Emailuser/ZeroOne|@]]</small>) 21:45, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

== The NAO diff file ==

So I was following the pages here on compiling and patching Nethack, and what I really wanted was a NAO-away-from-NAO, for when I didn't have internet or was behind a firewall or whatever.  When I tried patching the source with the nao.diff file, however, it gave me about 100 errors about lines not updating properly, and then I recompiled and ran the binary and it didn't have the menucolors or statuscolors or anything.  Am I missing a step or something?

Thanks!

==Protection racket troubles==

Discoverying(reading about) the protection racket and attempting the stratergy has taught me how to survive earlier stages of the game and made the game far more interesting then old approach of hacking monsters to death. The issue I am having with the protection racket approach is in the mines, I have yet to get to minetown without having my pet teleporting away. Seeing that protection racket depends a great deal on your pet killing the monsters, I was wondering if there is a means of either finding the traps or preventing your pet from moving onto the trap so that I can reach minetown at level one. Any suggestions would be most helpful.
Thank you to all in advance.
nusRa.

: I can partially second that (details buried in the pacifist talk page). It helps a little to
: * leash your pet, it will whine if a trap is nearby
: * acquire several ones (unless this slows you down to starvation)
: * zap a wand of detect unseen to search a large area for traps
: * develop a feeling for where traps could be. Choke points are especially worthy of extra searching.

== Multiple pages - casting spells etc. ==

Hi - just rediscovered Nethack after a gap of 18 years. I have a problem with any list greater than a page. Bringing up the inventory  gives me (1 of 3) pages that I can cycle through with the <enter> key, but I can only access the first page of other lists. Examples include casting spells <Z> and advancing skills <alt><e>, both of which are 2 pages long in my current game. They both say (1 of 2) but pressing <enter> (or indeed, anything else I can think of) just returns me to the game! Not an insurmountable problem, but infuriating.

I'm using Windows Vista and Nethack 3.4.3. Anyone had similar problems?

Edit: Thanks both of you, is working in my latest game. I'm sure that I tried both before, but, well, I'm getting old now and maybe read one too many scrolls of amnesia.

: Use < and > to cycle up and down.

::Hi, try the space-bar. I had the same problem to figure this out (just rediscovering Nethack too after this period of time)

== Terminal Position? ==

Hi,
I realise this is a really stupid position to be in, but I have somehow managed in a short space of time, from a good position, to a) pick up a loadstone and b) turn into a wererat. So, I have no equipment, except for the loadstone...but I can't move because it's too heavy. I could try praying, but I don't think that went well last time. There is no useful equipment or food on the square I am on...and I'm getting hungry.
I would welcome any suggestions which don't involve death....

: Praying would cure lycanthropy for good, but your god seems to be angry. Wait until your polymorph times out or until monsters turn up that cause you to "die", i. e. rehumanize. Then engrave [[Elbereth]] first thing, re-equip yourself, and deal with both problems as fast as you can. Luckily, at least you won't shred your armor when you turn back into a rat. On your way back, use Elbereth to lock off rooms in case you turn back into were form to keep the more dangerous monsters at bay. Good things to have are [[holy water[[ (+[[helmOA]] if chaotic), a [[sprig of wolfsbane]], an [[amulet of unchanging]], a [[ring of polymorph control]], or "pleased" [[prayer]]: they will all cure or keep [[lycanthropy]] at bay. In your situation, trying on un-id rings and amulets probably is a good idea. As for the [[loadstone]], there are lots of creative ways to get rid of it, even if you cannot uncurse it.
: Hunger should then be the least of your problems, just kill monsters once you are cured. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 11:16, September 12, 2009 (UTC)

== Giant shoggoth in the Gnomish Mines ==

So here's a good one. I'm a level 11 vampire necromancer (playing Slash'em, obviously), and I've just found one of my own bones files at Mine's End. Thing is, I remember this bones file--I was doing really good, had just cleared out the level, when out of nowhere a Giant Shoggoth devours me.

In all sense, I should flee from the nameless horrors of these depths without turning back. But I don't have a luckstone yet. Any ideas? I'm not close to being able to handle a shoggoth. But what are the odds of one actually being generated at this level--is it even possible (Dungeon level 10; and I wasn't more than a level 10 character when I met it last time, and it wasn't previously a bones file.) Is this certain to be just a chameleon or a polymorph trap that will wear off after a while?

Also, does see invisible reveal shoggoths when they're still hidden? I don't have telepathy (hard to get even from floating eyes for a vampire.) So that I can check without throwing away a pretty good game.

EDIT: Further investigation reveals that the corpse probably has Serpent's Tongue. I did a bit of sacrificing, and didn't get that as my first gift. (I got a lousy minion, instead.)

: Most likely, it is a polymorph trap. Anyway, either a wand of digging or a ring of protection from shape changers will neutralize it. IIRC, a Giant Shoggoth will respect Elbereth, if you decide to chance it. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 10:00, December 16, 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks. But as it happened I got a genocide wish from the throne in Grund's Stronghold, and used it on giant shoggoths. So whatever it was, it was gone when I got back.

==How to send messages==

How do i send a message to another player?
: I assume you're asking how to send a message to another player currently playing on NAO: press {{kbd|m}}. To reply, the player either engraves his answer or prefixes it with {{kbd|#}} to form an invalid command. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 20:49, December 28, 2009 (UTC)

== vlads tower ==

is the entrance to vlads tower under the big square i can't enter or one of the doors around it?

:The entrance to Vlad's Tower is simply an extra up-stairs on a random level between 34 and 42. If you're talking about the Wizard's tower, however, you need to keep going down past all the large squares you can't enter until you see a little island and moat in the middle of the level. There will be two of them (on two different levels) - one is a fake entrance, the other is real. The real one has a teleport trap in the middle. Which takes you inside the large squares that you couldn't previously enter.

== elemental planes ==

I'm never able to make it past the elemental planes.  What always happens is archons and titans keep summoning more of each other until the entire level is filled with them.  Wearing a ring of conflict doesn't seem to be enough to thin their numbers, unfortunately.  What am I supposed to do?  How do you deal with the hordes of archons?  I'm wondering - perhaps I'm genociding too many classes of monsters and thus, their summon spells summon more of each other?  Maybe I should pursue a more minimalist genociding strategy?

:The planes are different than any other part of the game - you should be racing through them as fast as possible, be in and out long before anything has a chance to summon and fill the level with anything. If there are some Titans/Archons in your way, shoot them with a wand of teleport to clear a path then keep running. Standing around trying to fight the Titans/Archons or trying to thin the herd with conflict is basically a guaranteed way to lose unless your character is mega-pimped.

== Ascending without doing the wizard quest ==

I accidently attacked the Wizard Quest NPC and got expelled. The game was going great until then and I have pretty much all the items needed to ascend.. Is it still worth trying to pursure the great ascension without the eye?

:You can definitely ascend without the Eye, but you might have a hard time without the [[Bell of Opening]].  --[[User:Andronikus|Andronikus]] 13:28, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

&&%s&& %s Nethack.alt.org {150205 2023-03-10T04:12:26Z {4000867 K2} NAO hosts 3.6.7 {{DISPLAYTITLE:nethack.alt.org}}
'''nethack.alt.org''', commonly abbreviated to '''NAO''', is one of the oldest NetHack [[public server]]s, and by far the most popular. A wealth of information about the server, as well as detailed statistics, [[chardump|end-of-game dumps]], [[ttyrec|tty recordings]] and the high score table is available on [http://alt.org/nethack/ NAO's web site.]

The [[NetHackWiki:About|NetHack Wiki]] is itself hosted on NAO.

NAO hosts exclusively [[NetHack 3.6.7]] for online play.

NAO is well integrated with #nethack on [[Libera]] through the [[Rodney (bot)|Rodney bot]], which announces all deaths on the server, to the morbid delight of all.

The program [[dgamelaunch]] is used to manage the games and user accounts.

== Getting started ==

To play, all you need is a [[ssh]] or [[telnet]] client. On Windows, the built-in telnet.exe is adequate, though most prefer to use [[PuTTY]]. It may be worth mentioning that ssh, being more secure, may be the better choice, otherwise someone might find out your password by sniffing the net.

Providing the clients are installed, in Mac OS X, other [[UNIX]]-like systems, and Windows, typing the following commands in a command prompt will get you connected:

 ssh nethack@alt.org

or

 telnet nethack.alt.org

In case the standard telnet port is blocked, you can also try port 14321 by typing the following command:

 telnet nethack.alt.org 14321

== User interface tips ==

=== For those used to the tiles (GUI) port ===

Anyone accustomed to the Qt tiles port will sorely miss a separate message window. Instead, game messages are displayed one line at a time in the terminal's top line. Most meaningful actions generate several lines that each have to be scrolled by with space or escape. This is, of course, standard behaviour in the [[tty]] form of Nethack.

The best solution is to use the [[curses interface]]. Alternatively, you can configure the [[MSGTYPE]] option to suppress junk messages. You can't use both at the same time.

You might want to turn off rest-on-space and either use {{kbd|space}} to scroll through the messages, or skip all messages at once with {{kbd|ctrl|space}}, then use {{kbd|ctrl|p}} to read a screenful at a time. (In that case, you'll have to set a preference to have {{kbd|ctrl|p}} list messages on a full screen instead of line by line; it's also good to have a healthy large number, say 50, of past messages saved.)

=== For those using Terminal.app in Mac OS X ===

To enable extended characters, do the following:

# In Terminal.app, choose "Preferences..." from the Terminal menu.
# Click the "Encodings" tab at the top. Check the checkbox next to "Latin-US (DOS)"
# Click the "Settings" at the top and create a new setting, probably titled "Nethack".
# In the text tab, check "Use bright colors for bold fonts". You may wish to adjust the bright or dim colors to make them more distinct (e.g. make dim yellow look brown). Note that you can only adjust these options in OS X Lion or later.
# In the new setting, click the "Advanced" tab and set "Character encoding" to "Latin-US (DOS)"
# In the same tab, change "Declare terminal as" to "xterm-16color". (also OS X Lion or later)
# Close the Settings window and open a new Nethack window from the Shell menu.
# In NetHack, enable the [[IBMgraphics]] option.
# (Optional) Install a smoother-looking font, [http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/ ProFont].

==== Alternative: Using white-on-black ====
Since certain monsters can be hard to see in the default black-on-white OS X terminal, it is best to go white-on-black before accessing NAO. It can be done with the following command:

 xterm -fa Monaco -fs 14 -fg white -bg black &

== NetHack 3.4.3 NAO ==

This section only concerns the NAO version of NetHack 3.4.3.

The following interface patches were added:

*[[menucolors]], compiled with posix regex
*[[sortloot]]
*[[dumplog]]
*[[showborn|showborn & extinct]]
*<s>[[hpmon]], with an added option to turn it off</s> (removed in favor of statuscolors)
*[[statuscolors]]
*[[dgamelaunch mail]]
*[http://www.iki.fi/jslahti/nethack.html#paranoid paranoid quit]
*slightly modified version of [http://bilious.alt.org/?205 use_darkgray]
*[http://bilious.alt.org/?198 showbuc]

*[[options#bones|Loading bones files can be switched off]]

Also, NetHack has been compiled with [[autopickup exceptions]], and several bugs have been fixed, including the [[Astral call bug]], a bug that allowed predicting the random numbers, and a crash when dropping gold in certain situations. There are also several new hallucinatory monster names, random engravings, random [[gravestone]] epitaphs and T-shirt messages.

A more detailed list of the changes and the [[patch|diff]] file are at http://alt.org/nethack/naonh.php

Several of NAO's interface improvements and bugfixes were borrowed from other [[variant]]s - this is also documented in the above diff file.

As of August, NetHack 3.4.3 and NetHack 3.6.0 are no longer hosted on NAO. However, this version of NetHack 3.4.3 is also used in other public servers, such as [[Hardfought]].

&&%s&& %s Patch {148537 2022-10-05T02:09:15Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} de-SLEX {{man|patch}}

In the context of ''[[NetHack]]'', a '''patch''' is a modification to the [[vanilla]] game or one of its variants not created by that game's [[DevTeam]]. Hundreds of patches can be found at the [[Bilious Patch Database]]. 

Some things that patches do:
* Add new features (items, monsters, traps, levels, artifacts) or change existing features.
* Add new playable [[role]]s, with their respective inventories, abilities, and quests. Examples: [[Convict]], [[Pirate]], [[Bard]].
* Enhance the interface in some way, such as coloring elements of the text display to [[Menucolors|highlight certain items]] or [[Statuscolors|alert you to low health or spell power]].

The practice of releasing individual patches, common in the 1990s and 2000s, has declined in popularity, particularly since NetHack's development source became publicly available. Instead, developers tend to fork NetHack on GitHub and make pull requests there. A pull request versus vanilla is functionally equivalent to a patch, though.

==Examples==
* [[Biodiversity patch]] &ndash; adds new monsters (as well as features from some other patches)
* [[Convict patch]] &ndash; adds a new role, the Convict
* [[Grudge|Grudge patch]] &ndash; causes certain classes of monsters (such as elves and orcs) to attack each other on sight
* [[Heck² patch]] &ndash; adds special predesigned rooms that can be generated in the maze levels of Gehennom
* [[Itlachiayaque]] &ndash; replaces the [[Orb of Detection]] with an artifact [[shield of reflection]]
* [[Lethe patch]] &ndash; adds a new branch, the Lethe Gorge, which appears before Gehennom
* [[Photography patch]] &ndash; adds photographs of monsters and dungeon features that are created whenever you apply an [[expensive camera]]
* [[Statuscolors]] &ndash; allows the user to configure the colors of the status line, to highlight [[properties|ailments]] or indicate low [[health]] or [[power]]
* [[Underground rivers]] &ndash; occasionally generates rivers of [[water]] or [[lava]] across levels

Many [[artifact YANIs]] have been made into patches.

==Influential patches==
Patch design is not only a popular activity for the NetHack community, but has also influenced the development of the game itself. The NetHack source includes some code that originated in patches for older versions. For example, many features of modern [[spellcasting]] first appeared in the [[Wizard Patch]], which was written for NetHack 3.2.0 to 3.2.3 but proved so popular that it became a part of version 3.3.0. 

The release of [[NetHack 3.6.0]] in December 2015 saw the addition of a number of patches, including the [https://bilious.alt.org/?195 Dull Book] and [https://bilious.alt.org/?151 Moving Clouds] patches, to the code.

Many [[variant]]s of NetHack also use content from existing patches, in addition to creating new content. For example, [[SLASH'EM]] included [[potion of amnesia|Lethe water]] and [[torch]]es, and [[UnNetHack]] includes [[grudge]]s and the Convict role.

==Adding patches to NetHack==
If you want to know how to patch your NetHack sources, see the article on [[patching]].

'''patch''' is also a program that can apply specially formed patch (also known as "[[diff]]" after the program that creates them) files. The usual invocation of patch is along the lines of
 patch -p1 &lt; patch_file

patch for the Windows platform may be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ (though it seems to have problems under Vista and Win 7, fix: http://jameswynn.com/2010/03/gnu-patch-in-windows-7-or-vista/). After downloading, the patch.exe file needs to be placed in the system PATH, so that it can be found when it is invoked from the command line. One possible place would be in the same directory as the compiler used to compile NetHack (e.g. \mingw\bin) for the MinGW compiler).

The '''potion of sleeping''' can make you fall asleep.

== Effects ==

[[Quaff]]ing a blessed potion puts you to sleep for for 13-23 turns, an uncursed one for 25-35 turns, and a cursed one for 37-47 turns.

If you have [[sleep resistance]] or [[free action]], "you yawn" and the potion will have no effect.{{refsrc|potion.c|611}}

Monsters will throw these at you. If the potion hits you, then the [[vapor]]s will make you fall asleep ("You feel rather tired.") for 1 to 5 turns, and [[abuse]] your dexterity.{{refsrc|potion.c|1263}} If the potion hits a monster, then the monster temporarily sleeps ("''(The monster)'' falls asleep.") for 1 to 12 turns, unless the vapors miss the monster or the monster has sleep resistance.{{refsrc|potion.c|1062}}

== Encyclopedia entry ==

This entry is also used for the [[potion of booze]].

{{encyclopedia|
On waking, he found himself on the green knoll whence he had
first seen the old man of the glen.  He rubbed his eyes -- it
was a bright sunny morning.  The birds were hopping and
twittering among the bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft,
and breasting the pure mountain breeze.  "Surely," thought Rip,
"I have not slept here all night."  He recalled the occurrences
before he fell asleep.  The strange man with a keg of liquor --
the mountain ravine -- the wild retreat among the rocks -- the
woe-begone party at ninepins -- the flagon -- "Oh! that flagon!
that wicked flagon!" thought Rip -- "what excuse shall I make
to Dame Van Winkle!"

'''Orcus-town''', also known as the '''ghost town''' (and The Orcus Level in the source), is a [[special level]] that occurs in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
Orcus-town is placed somewhere between the 10th and 15th levels of [[Gehennom]] (and therefore between DL 35 and DL 44). It may contain the stairs to [[Vlad's Tower]].

Orcus-town is eligible to leave [[bones]] files. The entire level is no-teleport, and all walls and the floor are diggable.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The demon lairs are no longer no-teleport levels, but the presence of the demon lord or prince will block others from teleporting.}}

The empty left hand side is filled with ordinary Gehennom-like maze, and contains the upstair.

[[Orcus]] is on the downstair, accompanied by two [[vampire]]s, two [[vampire lord]]s, two [[shade]]s, and a [[human zombie]]; in addition to the usual undead in the marked [[graveyard]], there are three vampires, two vampire lords, three human zombies, three [[ettin zombie]]s, three [[giant zombie]]s, four shades, five [[skeleton]]s and five random other monsters randomly placed in the town. The abandoned shops contain standard general store items, and usually a large contingent of [[mimic]]s; ten random other objects are created in the town. Two [[magic trap]]s, three [[fire trap]]s, a [[spiked pit]], an [[anti-magic trap]] and a [[sleeping gas trap]] are placed randomly.

==Strategy==
The main attraction on this level is Orcus' [[wand of death]]. If you approach him by battling through his entourage, he is likely to have used up all its charges by the time you reach him. One alternative is digging or level teleporting to the level below and climbing the stairs armed with a means of [[stoning]] him in one turn.

Orcus-town is also a darker, scarier version of [[Minetown]], in that there are two shops with many items and lots of [[mimic]]s. If you have spare [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]], it might be a good idea to [[genocide]] [[mimic]]s before you arrive on this level so that the shops are filled with more items (although by this stage of the game, your inventory and stashes should be well stocked).

}}
The '''wand of wishing''' is one of the most sought-after [[wands]] in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
There is a .5% chance that a randomly-generated wand will be a wand of wishing, making it one of the least-generated wands. However, one wand of wishing is always located in a [[chest]] inside the [[Castle]]. Normally, wands make up 4% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 6% in containers, 5% on the Rogue level, and 8% in Gehennom.

==Effects==
{{main|Wish}}
When [[zap]]ped or [[engrave]]d with, if the player's [[Luck]] is non-negative, the wand will [[auto-identify]] and allow the player to make a guaranteed [[wish]], making it the closest to a source of such in ''NetHack''. Note that wishing will increase your [[prayer]] timeout.

You cannot wish for a wand of wishing; this will give you a pre-charged wand of wishing with -1 charges (i.e. [[cancelled]]) with a 90% chance. The remaining 10% will result in a precharged wand with zero charges. 

The wand is unusual because it can only be recharged once; it always explodes if you try to recharge it a second time.{{refsrc|read.c|242}}

==Strategy==
{{main|Wish}}
If you come across a wand with a base cost of 500 in a shop, it is either a wand of wishing or a [[wand of death]]. Either is well worth purchasing, even if you must take the time for [[credit cloning]] or gathering [[junk]]. If you have no pet or are otherwise unable to do this, you may choose instead to wish for gold. See the wish article's [[Wish#Early wands of wishing|section on early wands of wishing]] for detailed instructions.

=== Charging ===
Your first wish from this wand should be a source of [[charging]], if you do not already have one. This typically involves wishing for 2 or 3 [[blessed]] [[scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]]. If you have already identified charging scrolls, you should wish for a [[magic marker]] and write your own. [[Wizard]]s with high [[Luck]] have a good chance of writing unknown scrolls, and should generally wish for a magic marker.

The other source of charging is [[the Platinum Yendorian Express Card]], but wishing for this to recharge your wand is a bad idea unless you are [[illiterate]], because [[Tourist]]s will not receive it at all, and other roles cannot perform blessed charging with it, so 1&ndash;2 of your wand's potential charges might be lost. Since Tourists can acquire the Platinum Yendorian Express Card on their quest, they may choose not to wish for a source of charging, and delay using their final wishes until they can complete their quest.

=== Wish extraction ===
''Never'' use a wand of wishing while your [[Luck]] is negative, because there is a chance that your wish will be lost. (''"Unfortunately, nothing happens."''){{refsrc|zap.c|1790}}

How to extract the maximum number of wishes follows:
# [[Zap]] or [[engrave]] with the wand until it reaches (0:0).
# Blessed-recharge the wand (this will bring the wand up to (1:3), while an uncursed scroll would bring it to (1:d3)).
# [[Zap]] or [[engrave]] with the wand until it reaches (1:0).
# [[Zap]] or [[engrave]] with the wand repeatedly to [[wrest]] the last charge.

If you fear the RNG, you may want to identify the wand first to find out how many charges it has left, rather than [[engraving]] until you get no message; although rare, there is no worse feeling than accidentally wresting the last charge out of a wand you meant to recharge.

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], wands of wishing are generated in a (1:''x'') state, as if they had already been recharged once. This effectively means that wands of wishing cannot be recharged, so scrolls of charging should not be wished for unless they're needed for some other purpose.

In addition, in UnNetHack, if a wand doesn't successfully wrest immediately, the wand turns to dust, but wresting chance was increased from {{frac|121}} to {{frac|5}} for blessed, {{frac|6}} for uncursed and {{frac|7}} for cursed wands.

The reduced charges of wands of wishing effectively mean UnNetHack games have 1&ndash;4 guaranteed wishes (1&ndash;3 charges plus a potential [[Wresting|wrest]]), whereas vanilla ''NetHack'' games have 5&ndash;7 guaranteed wishes (1&ndash;3 charges, plus 3 recharged, plus a guaranteed wrest). In the latter case, one of those wishes is usually spent on scrolls of charging, so the effective number of guaranteed wishes in vanilla is 4&ndash;6.

===NetHack Fourk===
In [[NetHack Fourk]], similar to UnNetHack, wands of wishing come precharged, but still spawn with the usual 1&ndash;3 charges, and not wresting immediately will not make the wand turn to dust. Wresting was made easier in Fourk. To compensate for this, Fourk adds a guranteed [[scroll of wishing]] to Orcus, Vlad's Tower's top floor, and Wizard's Tower's top floor.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], wands of wishing cannot be recharged, though their state is displayed as (0:''x'') rather than (1:''x''). When they reach 0 charges, they immediately turn to dust, so wresting them is impossible.

They are no longer generated randomly; instead, statically-placed wands of wishing are found in the [[Castle]], the top floor of [[Vlad's Tower]], the [[Fake Wizard's Tower]] that lacks the magic portal, the top floor of the real [[Wizard's Tower]], and the northeastern room of [[Moloch's Sanctum]]. All of these are generated with 1 charge, except the Castle's, which has 2.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], wands of wishing are handled the same as in xNetHack, with several individual wands scattered across [[Gehennom]], although the wand found in [[Vlad's Tower]] is cursed.

NetHackWiki has no ''formal'' style guide as of yet, but there are a few conventions in use. The following is a list of them. Changes should be discussed on the [[NetHackWiki talk:style guide|talk page]].

== NetHackWiki versus Wikihack ==
Please refer to this wiki as NetHackWiki. "Wikihack" is the name it was founded under.

== Tone ==
Although NetHackWiki is a guide in addition to being an encyclopedia, articles in the main namespace should nonetheless be written in a largely encyclopedic tone. That means clearly separating facts from comments, by putting strategy tips in their own section, and comments on the talk page. Spelling and grammar should follow Americanized language rules.

Make sentences short.

== Article names ==
Try to be consistent with existing articles:

* Name most pages with lowercase letters, like [[scroll of identify]], but use uppercase for proper nouns, like [[Amulet of Yendor]]. By default, MediaWiki forces the first letter of a page name to be uppercase.
* Prefer singular to plural (e.g. [[Unicorn]] instead of [[Unicorns]])
* Redirect acronyms like [[YAFM]] to pages like [[Yet Another Funny Message]]. However, [[identification]], [[scroll of identify]], and [[spellbook of identify]] can be three separate pages.

The first time the article name appears in the main text, it should be '''bolded'''. This includes the titles of any redirects redirecting to the article. Example: "'''Gauntlets of power''', sometimes abbreviated to '''GoP''', ..." 

===Redirects===
When creating a new article, redirect variations on that name to it, to avoid someone duplicating the article under a slightly different title.

For in-game messages, redirect the message (e.g. [[The golden haze around you disappears]]) to the article about the thing that caused it. If the message can have multiple causes, create a disambiguation page (e.g. [[Your skin feels warm for a moment]]).

The syntax for a redirect is as follows:

#REDIRECT <nowiki>[[spellbook of protection]]</nowiki>

See [[metawikimedia:Help:Redirect]] for help creating redirects.

==New articles==
Do not create empty new articles or new articles that contain nothing but the {{tl|stub}} message just in hopes of seeing someone add more content to them. Add the content yourself! A "{{tl|stub}}"-only page is somewhat like applying a [[magic marker]] to write a [[blank scroll]]. If you don't know about the subject, learn about it or ask politely at the [[NetHackWiki:Community Portal|Community Portal]] for someone to create the article.

==Capitalization==
In general, if the game or the source code capitalizes something, it should be capitalized on this wiki. "Archon", "Book of the Dead", and "Moloch's Sanctum" are examples of this. Note that Archon is not a proper noun, but it should still be capitalized because NetHack always capitalizes it. Always use "Luck" when referring to [[Luck|the in-game attribute]]; use "luck" to refer to good RNG or other "out-of-game" luck.

Conversely, do not capitalize things that the game does not capitalize and treats like common nouns (most monsters and objects fall into this category). Examples include "potion of hallucination", "tiger", and "rust trap".

==Headers==
The highest header level that should be used is <nowiki>==This==</nowiki>. Do ''not'' use <nowiki>=These=</nowiki>, they are reserved for the article main title only.

Each article should begin with a brief introduction before going into specifics. This introduction (also known as the "lede" in Wikipedia jargon) should ''not'' have a header, because its function is obvious and because when you omit the header, the introduction appears before the table of contents as it is supposed to.

===Section names===
Some sections are common to many articles. Try to use one of these for the section header rather than a variant like "Messages given", "Behavior in previous versions", or "External Links". Known standard sections are:

* Generation
* Map(s)
* Messages
* Strategy
* Variants
* Mythology 
* History
* Encyclopedia entry
* See also
* References
* External links

Generation should explain where and how the thing can be found or created.

The History section can contain information on how the subject was different in earlier versions of ''NetHack''. Other kinds of history should go in Mythology. If the thing is based on a real-life model, Origin may be a better heading.

The Encyclopedia entry should give the text of the subject's entry in the [[NetHack encyclopedia]], enclosed in an [[Template:encyclopedia|<nowiki>{{encyclopedia}}</nowiki> template]]. The template displays whitespace characters literally (like the HTML &lt;pre&gt; tag), so remove unwanted hard line breaks and whitespace at the beginning of lines. Browser window widths vary widely! Don't otherwise edit the contents: the encyclopedia entries are hard-coded in the game.

== Categories ==
Each new article should have at least one category assigned to it; read the [[NetHackWiki:Categories|category tree]] to find an appropriate one. Remember to update that tree if you create a new category.

== Tables ==
Many of our tables are pretty tables; the prettytable class from [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] can be used like this:

<pre>
{|class="prettytable"
!Header 1
!Header 2
|-
|Cell 1
|Cell 2
|-
|Cell 3
|Cell 4
|}
</pre>

to make this:

{|class="prettytable"
!Header 1
!Header 2
|-
|Cell 1
|Cell 2
|-
|Cell 3
|Cell 4
|}

It's also possible to use "striped" and/or "sortable" in addition to "prettytable".

== Colored NetHack glyphs ==
For example: {{yellow|A}}, {{green|n}}, {{orange|D}}

Use the 16-color [[:Category:Function_templates|function templates]] for displaying individual symbols. For monsters you should usually use {{tl|monsym}}, or {{tl|monsymlink}}.

To make colored ASCII screenshots, wrap the function templates in <tt><nowiki><div class="ttymap"></div></nowiki></tt>, or use [[User:Paxed/ReplaceCharsBlock]] with ruleset {{tl|ttymap}} to allow easier editing.

While editing an article, it's possible to have a "popup" window where you can select the colored symbols with mouse; Just click the "Color symbols" link at the bottom of the page.

== Item pages ==
Put the appropriate template out of [[Template:scroll]], [[Template:potion]], [[Template:ring]], [[Template:wand]], [[Template:spellbook]], [[Template:weapon]], [[Template:armor]], [[Template:comestible]], [[Template:amulet]], [[Template:artifact]], [[Template:artifact weapon]] and [[Template:tool]] at the top of the item page, or [[Template:item]] for any other type of item.

Each item page should also list the effects of the item, and any messages that item can generate. Tips and strategy relating to that item should go next, and if there is an entry from the NetHack encyclopedia, that can go at the bottom. Use [[potion of object detection]], [[scroll of amnesia]] and [[scroll of genocide]] as guides.

== <span id="SLASH'EM"></span> Variants ==
There are a plethora of NetHack variants, and they often change something in vanilla which should get documented on the vanilla page. This is fine, but in order to keep things organized, follow these guidelines:
# Only put variant information on a page if it is a substantial change to the topic of the page which has an impact on strategy. If it's a change to something else but which still has an impact on strategy, it's probably too tangential to be put on the page.
# All variant information should go in a level-two ==Variants== section near the bottom of the page but above the encyclopedia entry. Each variant then gets a level-three subsection within the Variants section. 
# The sole exception to the above rule is if there's only one variant worth writing about. In this case, it is okay to have that variant occupy a level-two ==VariantName== section, and no ==Variants== section. But if another variant is added later, then the first variant and the new variant should become level-three sections under a level-two Variants section.
# Avoid putting paragraphs, sentences, parentheticals, or asides referencing a variant outside of its section.
# Avoid further subdividing a single variant's section into more subsections; if you're adding level-four section breaks then it's probably a better idea to move that text into its own page.
# Variant articles that do have their own pages can be (they don't have to be) linked with a single line in the top of the Variants section. Don't create a subsection just to provide a link to the main article.
# Never add variant categories to a vanilla article. Use them only for pages which are entirely about variant(s).

Regarding [[SLASH'EM]]'s name, prefer "SLASH'EM" to "Slash'EM". There is no consensus on which one is "official", but we need a convention, and SLASH'EM is clearly an acronym. For capitalization of other variant names, consult the variant's main page.

==Source code==
When writing a piece of factual information, you may wish to document it by linking to the source code like this:

 <nowiki>The vibrating square level is not eligible to leave bones files.{{refsrc|src/bones.c|36|nethack=3.6.0|comment=vibrating square does not leave bones}}</nowiki>

which looks like this:

The vibrating square level is not eligible to leave bones files.{{refsrc|src/bones.c|36|nethack=3.6.0|comment=vibrating square does not leave bones}}

If the reference is placed after a word with a punctuation mark, don't insert it between the word and the punctuation mark; put it after both.

You must include the <nowiki><references/></nowiki> tag at the bottom of the page like this:

<pre>
==References==
<references/>
</pre>

That will create a list of footnotes:

<references/>

The templates {{tl|refsrc}}, {{tl|reffunc}}, {{tl|sourcecode}}, and {{tl|function}} are designed for use in source code references.

== Other useful templates ==
{{main|NetHackWiki:Templates}}

{{tl|DOD}} should go at the bottom of every page which is based on a spoiler by Dylan O'Donnell.

{{tl|disambig}} should go at the bottom of every disambiguation page, e.g. [[Fire]]. A disambiguation page is a list of links to articles all associated with the same title.

{{tl|stub}} can be used on a page to plea for someone to expand it. From time to time, some editors will look over [[:Category:Stubs]] for articles to expand. It can take no parameters, or it can take an optional parameter explaining what needs to be expanded:

 <nowiki>{{stub|What's the best strategy for killing the Wizard of Yendor?}}</nowiki>

{{tl|merge}} is a plea for someone to merge a page with another, or several others. You should give details of which other page you mean in the parameter:

 <nowiki>{{merge|Some of this information belongs in [[this article]].}}</nowiki>

{{tl|otheruses}} is for a page whose title has multiple meanings, like [[Izchak]]. In many cases, a disambiguation page may be more appropriate, but where one meaning dominates the others, it deserves the page title. Also see the {{tl|for}}, {{tl|for2}} and {{tl|distinguish}} templates.

{{tl|main}} can be used to link to the main article for a topic, per this section:

 <nowiki>{{main|NetHackWiki:Templates}}</nowiki>

{{tl|upcoming}} is for changes that have been made in an unreleased future version of NetHack. Since the development version is subject to change, it would be premature to try and document new features in the regular page text, so use this instead.

== Namespaces ==
Anything to do with ''NetHack'' belongs in the main article space. Anything to do with NetHackWiki belongs in the NetHackWiki namespace.

=== User pages ===
You can create a vanity page in the main namespace if you want to, but unless you are famous or otherwise notable it would be a better idea to create a NetHackWiki account and put personal information on your own User page.

== Sign your posts ==
When writing on articles'/users' talk-pages or on certain community pages, sign your posts with four tildes, '''<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>'''. That will automatically expand to your signature with timestamp, as in "[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 17:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)".

===Dealing with unsigned comments===
The templates {{tl|unsigned}} and {{tl|unsigned2}} can be used at the end of an unsigned comment to attach the username or IP to the comment. None of these templates automatically populate (fill in) the name or IP of the poster and the time of the post. That information is best copied from the history page and pasted into the following templates. '''Note''': All of the unsigned templates must be [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:SUBST|substituted]].

The template {{tl|unsigned2}} does almost the same thing as {{tl|unsigned}} when used with two parameters, but the ordering of the parameters is reversed. The resulting display is the same. This template may be useful when copying and pasting from the edit history, where the timestamp appears before the username.

== General principles ==
* Consider consulting [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Wikipedia's Manual of Style]]; some editors think that it is pretty good.
[[Category:NetHackWiki]]

== English syntax ==
Many NetHackers are not native English speakers -- that's great; everybody comes into the game with their own characteristics and intrinsics. This wiki is therefore written in eclectic, somewhat international English. But if you are writing on a public wiki, you're an advanced user of English, so you should know these things about English syntax:

* "chance of doing" versus "chance to do": One refers to probability; the other to opportunity. "You have a chance to do X" means "you have an opportunity to do X"; e.g., you get a turn to move or you get asked to confirm a choice. "You have a chance of doing X" means "there is a certain probability that you will do X", e.g. you have a 70% probability of turning into a newt when the witch curses you.

* There's more than one way to say it — and some ways get to the point a lot faster. For example, you can always replace "due to the fact that" with "because". Have a read through to catch such wordy bits before you click on Save Changes.

{{monclasssym|'}} '''Golems''' are a [[monster class|class]] of [[monsters]] in [[NetHack]]. As they are inanimate objects given life, their corpses are sometimes useful or valuable objects, especially in the case of paper and gold golems. Because they are artificial constructs, golems cannot be [[genocide]]d.

== Generation ==
Golems are randomly generated, and an appropriate golem can also arise when trying to polymorph large piles of objects at once, depending on the object material -- see the table above.  (Clay and stone golems can be produced by the same objects; one is chosen at random.  [[Polypiling]] many [[bone]] objects, such as [[unicorn horn]]s, can produce a [[skeleton]], which is not a golem.)

Stone golems can be created by [[stoning]] any of the other golems (e.g. with a [[cockatrice|cockatrice corpse]]). Stone golems themselves are stoning resistant, since it would be rather odd if stoning could kill them. 

Casting {{spell of|stone to flesh}} at a stone golem or a statue of any golem will turn it into a flesh golem. Flesh golems are weaker in combat than stone golems, and their corpses can give almost any resistance in the game.

== Mythology ==

[[wikipedia:Golem|Golems]] are creatures from ancient Jewish folklore. They are ''not'' derived from Gollum in ''The Lord of the Rings''. The legendary golem was made of clay, but the word has also been used to describe similar creatures made from other materials.

Although the encyclopedia entry for ''gold golem'' describes their mythological counterparts as female, the NetHack monster is neuter.

===UnNetHack===
[[UnNetHack]] includes wax golems, as described above.

In addition, the [[Sheol]] branch contains two new golem types, the [[ice golem]] and the [[crystal ice golem]].

== Encyclopedia entry ==
Several types of golem have their own specific entries in the encyclopedia. This entry is not shown for those.

{{encyclopedia|
"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth
century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is
said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to
help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other
menial work.
"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort
of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story
runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and
destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was
left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in
the Old Synagogue." ...
|[ The Golem, by Gustav Meyrink ]
