the start of the game.  Weapons whose identity has not yet been established
will have the APPEARANCE listed.

Each character class has a limit to the amount of skill that can be
obtained in each weapon class.  The maximum skill level is noted under
the ABCH KMPRaRo STVW columns: - for restricted (cannot advance beyond
unskilled), b for basic skill, s for skilled, E for expert, M for master,
and G for grand master.  Weapon skills are explained further below.

Finally, information about each weapon's ability to hit and cause damage
is listed.  A few weapons have an additional bonus to hit, listed in the
+HIT column.  The base amount of damage to small ("tiny", "small", and
"medium") and large ("large", "huge", and "gigantic") monsters is given
in the SDAM and LDAM fields, and is expressed in terms of die rolls.
For example, 2d6 means 2 dice which can each range from 1 to 6, for a
total from 2 to 12.  The average amount of damage (useful for comparing
weapons) against small and large monsters is given under SAVG and LAVG.


Weapon skills

    "First lesson," Jon said. "Stick them with the pointy end."
        -- George R.R. Martin, "A Game of Thrones"

The table of weapons above is organized by "skill classes".  Continued
use of a weapon gives you practice in its skill class.  With enough
practice in a skill class and experience levels, you may have the
opportunity to advance your skill level in that skill class.  This will
in turn lead to an improvement in your chance to hit and the damage
produced by weapons in that class.

There are specifically two requirements needed to advance a skill class:
a number of successful hits by any weapon in the skill class and a
number of experience levels.  A hit is considered successful if it
causes more than one point of damage to a monster, regardless if the
weapon is wielded or thrown.  The particular damage value used for this
determination is described in "Calculating damage" below.

The number of HITS needed to advance to a particular SKILL LEVEL is shown
in the tables above; this is cumulative from the beginning of the game
(although if you start at basic level in a skill you will be pre-credited
with the 20 hits needed to achieve it). For advancing riding skill, 100
turns spent moving is equivalent to one hit.

The other criterion used to advance skill levels is experience levels.
Each time you gain an experience level, you earn a "skill slot" that is
used up when you an advance a skill.  Thus you can earn a maximum of 29
skill slots, by advancing from level 1 to level 30.  If you lose an
experience level, you lose the associated skill slot; if that skill slot
was used to enhance a skill, you will lose the most recently earned skill
and are refunded the remaining skill slots from that skill level. 

The tables above also lists the number of additional EXPerience levels
(skill slots) needed to advance to that skill level (note the difference
between the two tables).  Unlike the number of hits, this number is not
cumulative.  Thus, it takes 2 skill slots to advance a weapon from basic
to skilled, no matter if you started with it as basic or unskilled.  Note
that these slots are shared with spell skills.

When you start the game, you will have basic skill for the weapons and
weapon-tools in your initial inventory, have basic skill in bare-handed
combat if you can advance it beyond expert, basic skill in riding if a 
Knight, and will be unskilled in all other weapon categories.  When you
reach the point when you can advance a skill category, you will see the
message, "You feel more confident in your (weapon/fighting) skills."
You can then advance the skill using the #enhance command (alt-e on some
systems).  You may choose to not advance a skill level if you want to
reserve the skill slots for a different skill. After advancing a skill,
if you are ready to advance another skill (possibly the same one), you
will get the message "You feel you could be more dangerous!"  The
#enhance command can also be used at any time to check your current skill
levels.

Of course, there are limits to how much you can advance a particular
skill category.  Each character class has different maximum levels for
each skill category, as can be seen in weapons table 2 above.  These
differences help to distinguish the various character classes late in
the game.  For example, note that many of the fighter classes have skill
with swords, whereas Priests are restricted from edged weapons but are
good with bludgeons and missiles.  Note that you can usually advance your
starting weapons and your Quest Artifact (if it is a weapon) to expert
skill.

The term "restricted" is used to describe skill categories that are
permanently unskilled.  They do not appear in the #enhance menu, although
you will see skills that are unskilled and can be advanced.  If you
receive an artifact weapon from crowning or sacrificing, and the
artifact's skill category is restricted, then the restriction will be
removed and you will be able to advance that skill to basic level; only
hits made after the unrestriction count towards this advancement.

Note that only character classes who are unrestricted in two-weapon
skill are able to use the #twoweapon command in their unpolymorphed
form.

Weapon skills affect your game by adding a bonus to your chance to hit
and your damage.  The WEAPON +HIT and +DAM columns in the table above
shows the amount of this bonus for each skill level. 

If you attack a monster while not wielding any weapon, you will cause
either bare-handed damage (d2) or martial arts (d4) damage.  You only
cause one or the other, depending on your character class.  These skills
can be enhanced just like weapon skills -- even to levels beyond those
of weapons (master and grand master) -- and have their own +DAMage bonuses.
The martial arts bonus also applies when attacking a monster by kicking it.


Calculating the chance to hit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "weapons", by Robert DeLoura and
Boudewijn Waijers.)

There are four ways to attack a monster with a weapon.  You can hit the
monster directly by wielding the weapon and stepping into that monster's
square.  If no weapon is wielded, you use your bare-handed or martial
arts skill.  Second, you can use the throw command to throw a weapon or
any other object (just type the object's inventory letter), or the fire
command to throw the object currently in your quiver.  Missiles (such as
arrows) are fired from launchers (such as bows) by wielding the launcher
and throwing the missile.  Third, you can kick an object at a monster, or
just kick a monster in an adjacent square. Finally, you can apply a
wielded polearm (lances are, for combat purposes, considered polearms) at
a monster at a distance: if your skill in that weapon is basic or worse,
the monster must be exactly two squares away orthogonally; if skilled, it
may also be a knight's-move away; if expert (can only apply to lances),
anywhere at two moves' distance.

It is possible that you may hit with more than one weapon in a turn:
* If you are using two-weapon combat, then if your primary weapon hits and
  is not destroyed in the process, and the monster is not dislodged from its
  position, your secondary weapon also automatically hits. 
* When firing any arrows from any bow, bolts from a crossbow, stones from a
  sling, or throwing daggers, darts or shuriken, there may be a chance that
  several get shot in one turn. The maximum number starts at 1, and receives
  the following additions:
  +   1 if you are skilled in the weapon.
  +   2 if you are expert in the weapon.
  +   1 if you are a Ranger, a Rogue throwing daggers, or a Samurai firing
      ya from a yumi.
  +   1 if you are an elf firing elven arrows from an elven bow.
  +   1 if you are an orc firing orcish arrows from an orcish bow.
  +   If this results in a maximum higher than the number of missiles you
      have, the maximum is reduced to that number.
  The number actually fired on any given turn is d(maximum). This can be
  capped by giving a numerical prefix to the fire or throw command; doing
  so will only decrease, never increase the number you fire.

Your chance to hit is based on the sum of the following items.  The larger
the number, the better your chance to hit.

The following are added to all attacks:
+   The target monster's armor class.
+   Your experience level, or your hit dice if you are polymorphed.
+   Your total numerical luck, which can range from -13 to +13.
+   A bonus based on your dexterity (see DEXT +HIT in the table below).
+   Your increase accuracy bonus (such as from rings).
+   1 if you are in elven form and are attacking an orc (any o or orcish
    undead).
+   2 if the target monster was asleep.  It will awaken, whether you hit
    or miss it.
+   4 if the target monster was paralyzed.  There is a 10% chance that
    the monster will be unfrozen.

The following are added only when attacking a monster directly with
a wielded weapon or bare-handed (melee attacks):
+   1 bonus for attacking directly.
+   A bonus based on your strength (see STRENGTH +HIT in the table
    below).
+   1 if you are XL 1 or 2 (game-balancing beginner's luck).
+   -1 if you are burdened, -3 if stressed, -5 if strained.  You cannot
    attack in any way if you are overtaxed or overloaded.
+   -3 if you are trapped.
+   2 if the target monster was stunned.
+   2 if the target monster was fleeing.
+   -20 if you are a Monk wearing body armour.
+   If you are a barehanded Monk not wearing body armour or a shield, 2
    plus your experience level divided by three.

The following are added only when attacking by throwing, firing or
kicking a weapon, or applying a polearm (long- and medium-range attacks):
+   -1 penalty for attacking from a distance.
+   +2 to -4, depending on your distance to the target monster.
+   -2 to +5, depending on the size of the target monster.
+   2 with a heavy iron ball.
+   4 with a boomerang.
+   2 with throwing weapons (daggers (except athames), knives (except
    scalpels and worm teeth), spears, javelins, war hammers, aklys, darts,
    shuriken).
+   -2 with non-throwing weapons.
+   6 with a boulder.
+   1 if you are an elf or Samurai wielding any bow and shooting any arrow.
    This bonus is 2 when an elf uses an elven bow or a Samurai uses a yumi.
+   Some gloves are a hindrance if you wield any bow class.  Gauntlets of
    power are -2, and gauntlets of fumbling are -3.
+   -4 if you throw or kick a missile without wielding a matching
    launcher:
        LAUNCHER(S)                  MISSILE(S)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        orcish bow, bow, elven bow,  orcish arrow, arrow, silver arrow,
          yumi                         elven arrow, ya
        sling                        gems and stones
        crossbow                     crossbow bolt
+   Enchantment of the launcher you are wielding, if you threw or kicked
    a matching missile.
+   -1 if your launcher is damaged, -2 if it is very damaged, or -3 if
    it is thoroughly damaged.  This only applies when you kick or throw
    a matching missile.
+   An artifact launcher +HIT bonus, if any applies.

If the target monster is being attacked with a weapon or weapon-tool --
your (primary) wielded one when attacking directly or with a polearm, or
the missile if thrown or kicked -- there are additional bonuses based on
that object:
+   The object's enchantment.
+   The object type's to-hit bonus.  See +HIT in weapons table 2.
+   A weapon skill +HIT bonus if not using two weapons; see WEAPON +HIT
    in the weapon skills table above, for the current skill level of
    that weapon.
+   A penalty if using two weapons and/or riding while poorly skilled;
    see 2-WEAP +HIT and RIDING +HIT in the weapon skills table above.
    (For the former purpose, your skill is considered to be the lower of
    your actual two-weapon skill and your skill in your primary weapon.)
+   An additional -2 if using two weapons while riding, regardless of skill.
+   2 for blessed weapon(-tool) against a demon or undead monster.
+   2 for weapons in spear class against X, D, J, N, or H.
+   2 for a trident against snakes or sea monsters out of water.
+   4 for a trident against any swimmer in water.
+   2 for weapons in pick-axe class against xorns and earth elementals.
+   An artifact +HIT bonus, if any applies.

A die from 1 to 20 is rolled and compared to the to-hit total.  If the
die roll is less than the to-hit total (or equal when throwing or
kicking), you hit the monster and inflict damage as described below;
otherwise, you miss the monster.  The die roll is also used in determining
if certain "chance" artifact effects occur (e.g., beheading or Magicbane's
special attacks).

There are also some special cases.  If you are swallowed or engulfed by
a monster, then direct or thrown attacks always succeed, although you
will be unable to kick or apply polearms.  Unicorns will always catch
gems and glass that is thrown or kicked at them, causing no damage. Your
Quest Leader will always catch your Quest Artifact, and return it to you
if peaceful.

Calculating damage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "weapons", by Robert DeLoura and
Boudewijn Waijers.)

If you hit directly without wielding anything, you inflict either bare-
handed base damage (d2) or martial arts base damage (d4). No base damage
occurs against shades. If the base damage is more than one point, you
exercise that weapon skill.  Added to this is a d4 bonus if wearing
blessed gloves while fighting undead or demons, or d20 if wearing a silver
ring(s) and no gloves while fighting a silver-hating monster.  There is
also a small chance of stunning your opponent and causing it to stagger
back a space (if it can); this will only happen if you are wearing neither
body armour nor shield and are in your natural form.

Damage from weapons, weapon-tools, gems, stones, ball, or chain is the
total of the following:
+   Impacting object's base damage (SDAM or LDAM above, accordingly)
+   Impacting object's enchantment (weapon and weapon-tool only)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=   Subtotal A
#   Subtotal A is set to zero if attacking thick-skinned creature with
    item made of venom, wax, food, paper, cloth, or leather (namely, a
    bullwhip).  Thick-skinned creatures include: gargoyle, winged gargoyle,
    all mimics, mumak, titanothere, baluchitherium, mastodon, all baby and
    adult dragons (D), earth elemental, all baby and adult nagas (N), xorn,
    skeleton, gold golem, wood golem, clay golem, stone golem, glass golem,
    iron golem, horned devil, barbed devil, shark, crocodile, salamander,
    Chromatic Dragon, and Ixoth.
#   Subtotal A is set to zero if attacking a shade without silver.
#   Heavy iron ball sets subtotal A to 1-25, depending on weight.
+   d4 if using a blessed item against undead or demon.  Undead include
    all liches (L), all mummies (M), all vampires (V), all wraiths/wights
    (W), all zombies (Z), ghosts, and shades.  Demons are all & except
    Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail daemon, djinn, and sandestins.
    This bonus can't be doubled.
+   d4 if using an axe or battle axe against a wooden creature (namely,
    wood golems).  This bonus can't be doubled.
+   d20 if silver weapon against silver-hating creature.  These include
    all were-creatures (in both human and creature form); all vampires
    (V); all demons (&) except Death, Pestilence, Famine, the mail
    daemon, djinn, and sandestins; shades; and all imps (i) except 
    tengu.  This bonus can't be doubled.
+   erosion penalty from whichever of rust/fire damage or rot/corrosion
    damage is greater (-1 = damaged, -2 = very damaged, -3 = thoroughly 
    damaged). This won't reduce subtotal B beyond 1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=   Subtotal B.  This is the value that must be greater than one for the
    hit to be counted toward a weapon skill.
+   If you are a Rogue in natural form hitting a fleeing monster, aren't
    stuck or using two weapons, and subtotal B is more than one point,
    you strike from behind with an additional random damage from 1 to
    your experience level.
+   2d10 for a successful joust (2d2 if with a secondary weapon). This
    bonus can't be doubled. To joust successfully, you need to hit with a
    lance in melee while riding (and not fumbling or stunned), and the
    chance is dependent on your skill in lance (or, if two-weaponing, the
    lower of your skill in two-weapon combat and in lance): 20% at
    unskilled, 40% at basic, 60% at skilled, 80% at expert. The monster
    will be stunned for a turn and thrown back a square (if possible).
    There is a small chance that the lance will break (dependent on your
    Luck). Successfully jousting will always exercise your weapon skill.
+   1 if you're a Samurai using ya with a yumi, or are an elf using elven
    arrows with an elven bow. Polymorph doesn't count.
+   Artifact damage bonus, doubling, and/or special attacks.  This may
    apply only against certain creatures.  See art1-343.txt.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
=   Total damage
Hitting directly with a launcher, hitting directly with a missile, using
the wrong missile with a launcher, or using a polearm at close range
(unless mounted) causes only d2 damage (zero against shades) and does not
exercise your weapon skill. If you attack directly with a boomerang,
there's a chance (decreasing with higher Luck) that the boomerang
breaks, causing another 1 point of damage (no damage to shades).

Damage from other objects are as follows.  No weapon skills are exercised.
  OBJECT            DAMAGE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  corpses           2 to 8, depending on size.  Cockatrice/chickatrice
                    corpses (nicknamed "rubber chickens") turn monsters
                    to stone, or do no damage if monster is stoning-
                    resistant.
  eggs              1, penalize luck if you laid it, and no increase
                    damage bonus.
                    Cockatrice/chickatrice eggs (nicknamed "stoning
                    grenades") turn monsters to stone, or do no damage
                    if monster is stoning-resistant.
  clove of garlic   1, makes undead (but NOT demons) flee for 2d4 (more)
                    turns.
  cream pie,        0, blinds target; no increase damage bonus.
    blinding venom  
  acid venom        2d6 to monsters not acid resistant; no increase
                    damage bonus.
  potions           See pot1-343.txt.
  expensive camera  0, breaks camera, no increase damage bonus.
  mirror            1, breaks mirror (even on shades) with a -2 penalty
                    to your luck.
  boulder           d20.
  heavy iron ball   1 to 25, depending on weight and subject to rusting.
  iron chain        d4+1, subject to rusting.
  other objects     1 to 6, depending on weight. Silver objects receive
                    a +d20 bonus against a silver-hating creature (see
                    above for list).

Additional damage can occur to all of the above attacks (even against
shades; however, the first two bonuses are not applied if your current
damage total is less than one):
+   Your increase damage bonus (such as from rings), unless if noted
    above.
+   The STRENGTH +DAM bonus from the attributes adjustment table above.
    This won't occur if you aren't allowed the increase damage bonus, or
    if you're firing a missile from a launcher.
+   If you scored a hit that exercises a weapon skill, the +DAM bonus
    for that weapon skill or for two-weapon combat skill (and for
    riding skill if applicable, unless using two weapons). If fighting
    with two weapons, your skill for this purpose is considered to be the
    lower of your actual two-weapon skill and your skill in the single
    weapon scoring the hit.
+   If you hit a non-poison-resistant monster with a fired poisoned
    missile, there's a 10% chance of an instant kill, else you inflict d6
    more damage.
Your total damage is limited from being negative.  If you are allowed an
increase damage bonus, you will score at least 1 point of damage.

When you attack a monster and are polymorphed into a creature, you usually
use the attacks of your polymorphed form.  However, if you are in a form
that can use a weapon, are wielding something, and attempt a weapon,
claw, kick, bite, sting, touch, butt, or tentacle attack, then you will
attack with the wielded object instead.

You may sometimes shatter your opponent's weapon if you are wielding a
two-handed weapon, or are a Samurai wielding a katana with nothing in your
off-hand. Your skill with your weapon must be skilled or better.  The chance
depends upon your weapon's erosion and the ability of your opponent's weapon
to resist; it is about 2.5% under the best circumstances.  This attack also
causes the monster to flee for 2d3 (more) turns.

Some monsters fight back passively when attacked.  Also, when a black or
brown pudding is hit directly with an iron weapon, it will be cloned
after taking damage.


What's the relationship between launcher and missile modifiers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A very brief summary (for the full details, see the above two sections) of
which effects enchantments, erosions, and artifact combat bonuses will have
when using a launcher and missile in the correct combination:

Choosing an early weapon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most players know that the best weapons in NetHack are artifacts (see
art1-343.txt and art2-343.txt).  However, you usually won't find a good
artifact weapon until you are well into a game.  Which weapons should you
use until then?

The best general advice is to use the same weapon preferences that
monsters use.  Their choices of wielded weapons for hand-to-hand combat,
from most to least preferred, are as follows:

Classes that are good fighters usually start with good weapons (for
example, BKRaSV), but other classes may want to switch to a different
type of weapon as soon as possible.  During the first few levels of the
game, you can #untrap dart and arrow traps to get some ranged weapons to
throw.  Daggers (especially elven) are often left by monsters in the
first few levels and in the mines, and have a +2 to-hit bonus.  Pick-axes
(good to practice skill for dwarvish mattock), unicorn horns, and
quarterstaffs (from wood golems) appear somewhat later in the game and
are good choices for certain classes.

Note that you will start out unskilled in weapon categories other than
your starting weapons, which makes fighting with other weapons difficult
until you can advance them to basic.  Using petrifying corpses requires
gloves and has other risks.  Naturally, there are other ways to fight
and defend yourself as well.


Weapon enchantment and erosion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "enchant.lim" by Peter Snelling and
Boudewijn Waijers.)

Your weapon's enchantment (e.g., -1, +0, +2) affects both your chance to
hit monsters and the amount of damage produced.  However, damage is
reduced if your weapon has been eroded by rust/fire or corrosion/rotting.

Some weapons are made of materials that do not erode (see weapons table 1),
but others must be specially protected to prevent erosion.  This section
explains how to enchant your weapon and protect it from erosion.

All of the weapons and tools listed above can only be enchanted by reading
scrolls of enchant weapon.  You must wield the weapon first.  The effect
is dependent upon the blessed status of the scroll and the weapon's
enchantment before reading the scroll.  A blessed scroll adds 1 or more
enchantments, based on the current enchantment (see table below).  An
uncursed scroll adds only one enchantment.  Cursed scrolls remove one
enchantment; however, artifacts other than Sting or Orcrist are not
affected by cursed scrolls of enchant weapon.
  Current enchantment  -3 to -1  +0 to +2  +3 to +5  +6 to +8  +9 or more
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~
  Additional possible   1 to 4    1 to 3    1 to 2       1       0 to 1

A blessed or uncursed scroll will further make a cursed weapon uncursed,
and will convert a worm tooth into a crysknife.  Cursed scrolls will
convert a crysknife into a worm tooth.  There is also a 2/3 chance of
your weapon being destroyed if it was more than +5 (less than -5) before
reading a non-cursed (cursed) scroll.

Thus, the maximum safe enchantment for a weapon is +7.  This is obtained
by reading uncursed or blessed scrolls until +5 is reached, and then
reading a blessed scroll.  If by chance this results in +6, you should
bring the enchantment back down to +5 -- by engraving one letter with
the weapon or by reading a cursed scroll of enchant weapon -- before
trying again.  Note: Engraving works only for weapons with edges, and for
athames only when they are cursed.  Weapons may also lose enchantments
when zapped with a spell of drain life or used to hit a disenchanter, but
may resist; artifacts will resist more than ordinary weapons.

The artifact Magicbane has special attack effects that decrease in
frequency as the enchantment is increased.  See art2-343.txt for a
discussion on why enchantment to +2 is the optimal point to maximise
these.

A special case occurs if you are confused while reading a scroll of
enchant weapon.  Blessed or uncursed scrolls of enchant weapon while
confused will remove any rust, fire, corrosion or rot damage and
erodeproof your weapon.  The weapon's current enchantment does not matter.
In the special case of crysknives, they become "fixed"; unfixed crysknives
have a 100% chance of reverting to a worm tooth when they cease to be
carried (possibly within a container) by you or a monster, fixed only 10%.

Reading a cursed scroll of enchant weapon while confused removes any
erodeproofing but will not otherwise damage your weapon.  You can also
choose a weapon that doesn't damage (such as one made of silver),
temporarily protect your weapon by applying a layer of grease from a
can of grease, or #dip a damaged metallic weapon into a non-cursed
potion of oil to remove one level of each type of damage.

&&%s&& %s Acronym {25317 2008-02-04T22:49:56Z {458 Kernigh} #REDIRECT [[Acronyms]], the page is a list of acronyms, so I am using the plural. #REDIRECT [[Acronyms]]}
&&%s&& %s Do not pass go. Do not collect 200 zorkmids. {144662 2022-02-25T14:08:06Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Strategies */ [[Image:One Turn Fail.JPG|thumb|400px|Off to a poor start.]]

If the player somehow manages to die on or before the first turn (indicated by "T:1" if the [[time]] option is enabled), the following message appears:

:{{message|You die... ''Do not pass go. Do not collect 200 [[zorkmids]].''}}

The message is a reference to the ''Monopoly'' board game: Monopoly players periodically pass the Go space on the board and earn 200 dollars each time they do so, and players that end up going to the Jail space must not pass Go, even if Go is between their current position and Jail. The Chance and Community Chest cards that can deliver this penalty read: ''"Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200"''

==Causes of death==
Many players never receive this message, but outside of [[#Intentional 1-turn death|intentional attempts]], there are a few rare accidents that can cause it.
* Probably the most common way is to start as a [[Knight]], attempt to #[[ride]] your [[pony]] at turn 1, fall off, and take enough damage to die. The #ride command uses a turn if you mount successfully, but does not use a turn if you mount and fall off, making it possible to trigger this with repeated failed attempts.
* As your first move, you might trip a trap that kills you. While most of the sufficiently dangerous traps never appear at dungeon level 1, it is still possible to trigger a [[dart trap]] that fires a poisoned [[dart]] and hits the 10% [[instadeath]], or suffer the fate of many [[Pet|cats and dogs]] at the hands of a [[falling rock trap]].
* You zap an offensive wand that produces a ray (e.g. fire, cold, magic missile) as your first move, and the ray bounces from a wall and kills you. In a similar vein, a [[wand of polymorph]] can trigger a [[system shock]] if you use it on yourself, with a good chance of instantly killing the character in question. This last type of death is comparatively rare, since only [[wizard]]s can start with such wands.

The following accidents might also trigger this message:
* The game places an unidentified object that can kill you if you use it (such as a cursed wand) on the first up staircase, and autopickup is enabled. After grabbing the item (which does not use a turn with autopickup), if using it kills you (e.g. a cursed wand explodes or the ray rebounds and hits you, similar to the wizard example above) you will trigger the message.
** This includes [[artifact blast|blasts]] from cross-aligned [[artifact]]s, though the odds of such an event are infinitely lower. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9oMSPzChgk Here, ais523 demonstrates] a tool-assisted first-turn death to picking up [[Grayswandir]] as a [[Tourist]]; he has calculated the odds of this to be roughly 1 in 3 million.

==Methods and avoidance==
To avoid the most common possible source, [[Knight]]s should simply not try to #ride their starting [[pony]] until they can survive the possible 14 HP damage from falling off. If attempting to ride your steed fails on turn 1, do not try to #ride again until the pony has sufficient tameness and/or you have more [[hit points]].

It is also good advice in general to avoid aiming a wand or spell at a wall if the angle of the ray will cause it to bounce back at you, unless you can resist the ray's damage or have a means of [[reflection]].

=== Intentional 1-turn death ===
[[File:WizardryFlunker.png|left|thumb|320px|Commiting suicide on the first turn with a wizard's wand of lightning.]]
On the other hand, there are also a few intentional methods for a curious player to trigger the message; as above, a Knight attempting to ride their saddled pony can do so, although this may "fail" if the game allows them to mount their steed. As mentioned previously, wizards can start with one of many random wands, and may have a powerful wand to zap themselves with, such as a [[wand of fire]] or [[wand of lightning]]. Casting [[force bolt]] or {{spell of|magic missile}} at yourself will fail because of your cloak's [[magic resistance]].

In addition, wizards and monks start with random scrolls that can assist in intentional first-turn deaths:

* The [[scroll of genocide]] can be read to genocide your own race.
* A [[scroll of fire]] may deal sufficient damage to you, including exploding potions.
* An uncursed [[scroll of earth]] will bring down a boulder on your head. 

It is also possible, albeit time-consuming, to overflow the [[turn]] counter to turn 1 and then die, technically fulfilling the condition for the message.

Due to the various reasons above, killing a character on the first turn this way tends to occur when start-scumming wizards, since that player will want to get to the next starting inventory roll as quickly as possible - on sheer averages, this means a first-turn death is very likely to be reported at least once.

==Strategy==

None of the rodents are a real threat. They are split between the [[rats]], amongst the weakest monsters in the game and the hardy but slow [[rock mole]]. The [[woodchuck]] is not randomly generated, but shares rock mole characteristics (but although they [[dig]] they are not [[metallivore]]s).

The [[wererat]] is the weakest of the lycanthropes but is more dangerous than other rodents due to its [[Monster_(command)|summon help]] ability and the [[lycanthropy]] affliction.

&&%s&& %s Ray {143775 2021-12-02T03:46:26Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* Breath attacks */ red naga '''Rays''' are directional attacks produced by certain [[wand]]s, [[spellbook|spells]], [[horn]]s, and [[monster]] attacks.

The ray attack is animated on screen, and a horn or wand will auto-identify if you are not blind. A standard ray will bounce if it hits a wall or a creature with [[reflection]]. Rays are halted by [[door]]s, although many will destroy the door in the process. The ray characteristics allow you to attack enemies without reply in the right situation. In the wrong situation, you may be unable to use your powerful ray attacks for fear of shooting yourself.

Non-standard rays include digging and fireball. A [[wand of digging]] cuts through walls and doors to its maximum range, while fireballs explode on impact.

A ray will travel 7 to 13 squares.{{refsrc|zap.c|3308|comment=ray wand range}} For each monster hit, range decreases by 2.{{refsrc|zap.c|3434|comment=ray hit monster}} If fire passes over water or a fountain, or cold passes over water or lava, range may decrease by 1, 3, or the ray may stop entirely.

==Bouncing rays==
Rays that intersect with a wall will bounce, if they have sufficient range to continue to affect squares.

===Straight reflections===
A ray hitting a wall straight on will move one square into the wall and then bounce straight back, meaning it may hit a monster twice, even one standing against the wall hit. Just beware of it also hitting you!

If a ray hits a wall at an angle, it usually penetrates the wall one square and reflects accordingly. Note that the penetration does not affect something on the other side of the wall but will hit something ''in'' the wall (like a [[xorn]]).

If a ray hits a concave (or "internal") corner, it will always reflect the ray back towards its point of origin.

 ┌----          \----          ┌----

 Ray heading    Hits wall      Ray also will
 up-left        starts heading hit @ if able
                down-right

If the ray hits a convex (or "external") corner, the ray reflects randomly between 3 cases: it has 1/20 chance of reflecting straight back; a 19/40 chance of reflecting left, and a 19/40 chance of reflecting right.{{refsrc|zap.c|3490}}

&&%s&& %s Larn {132778 2020-03-11T05:26:28Z {4000978 Aximili} add link '''''Larn''''' was an old [[roguelike]] game. Larn took inspiration from ''[[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]'' and ''[[Hack]]''. In the past, ''Larn'' and ''[[NetHack]]'' had contemporary development, and some Larn references entered NetHack.

But NetHack continued development and became a popular game with a large community, while Larn stalled. Larn is now an obscure game with few players.

The '''Larn Revenue Service''' or '''LRS''' is the tax agency that seeks to collect from wealthy Larn players.

== Larn references in NetHack ==
Two [[message]]s in NetHack reference Larn.

; This seems to be junk mail addressed to the finder of the Eye of Larn.
: This message appears when you read a [[scroll of mail]]{{refsrc|read.c|657}} from a [[bones level]]{{refsrc|bones.c|87}} or a [[wish]].{{refsrc|objnam.c|2523}} A comment in NetHack's source code explains, "the game Larn actually sends you junk mail if you win!"
; The LRS would be very interested to know you have that much.
: This message appears when you attempt to drop or throw a negative amount of gold. You cannot directly input a negative number, but you can enter a large 2^32-n number that triggers [[integer overflow]]. Try the key sequence 'd4294967286$' to trigger this message. A comment in NetHack's source code explains that older versions of NetHack and Larn had the same bug to permit drops of [[negative gold]].{{refsrc|invent.c|996}}

(A related crash when you drop zero gold has been fixed on [[nethack.alt.org]].)

* The game version, start time, and end time.
* What was shown on the screen when the game ended.
* The last messages.
* The fully identified inventory. (Some dumplog implementations might additionally provide what the player knew about them at the time.)
* The player's attributes.
* The lists of vanquished creatures, [[genocide]]s, and [[extinction]]s.
* The [[conducts]] the player followed.
* The dungeon [[overview]] (in 3.6.1 and beyond).
* In some implementations, if the player died, their [[Options#tombstone|tombstone]].
* The computation of the player's [[score]].

Dumplogs support was introduced natively in [[NetHack 3.6.1]], but needs to be enabled in [[sysconf]].

[[NetHack 3.6.0]] and prior versions do not produce a dumplog, unless the game is [[patch]]ed (which many public servers do). A player using [[tty]] can cut and paste off the screen if they really want to.

&&%s&& %s Stun (monster spell) {136477 2020-12-14T02:04:09Z {4001463 Actual-nh} Link monster spell '''Stun''' is a [[monster spell]] that will [[stun]] you. The length of the stun is dependent on a few factors. If you have [[magic resistance]] or [[free action]], you will always be stunned for only one turn. If you have [[half spell damage]], the stun length will be halved. The spell will stun for 4d4 turns, or 6d4 if the player's [[dexterity]] is less than 12.

==Messages==
; "You feel momentarily disoriented."
: A monster cast this spell on you, but you had magic resistance or free action and so were only stunned for one turn.

; "You reel..."
: You are stunned for 4d4 turns. If your dexterity is less than 12, you are stunned for 6d4 turns instead.

; "You struggle to keep your balance."
: You were already stunned.
