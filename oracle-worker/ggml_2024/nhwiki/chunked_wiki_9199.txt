Compiled for 3.2.2 by Kevin Hugo.

Smoky and milky potions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Potions with the appearance "smoky" may release a djinni and lead to a
wish.  Each time you or another monster quaff a smoky potion, there is a
chance of creating a djinni, depending on the number of djinn that have
already been created in the game:
  DJINN:  0     1     2     3     4     5        n       >=120
  PROB:  1/13  1/15  1/17  1/19  1/21  1/23  1/(13+2*n)    0

When the djinni appears, the potion is used up and one of five outcomes
can occur.  The relative chance of these outcomes depends on whether the
smoky potion was blessed, uncursed, or cursed:
  BLESSED  UNCURSED  CURSED  OUTCOME
  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~
    80%       20%       5%   Grants one wish, then disappears.
                             "I am in your debt.  I will grant one wish!"
     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a pet.
                             "Thank you for freeing me!"
     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a peaceful monster.
                             "You freed me!"
     5%       20%       5%   Speaks, then vanishes.
                             "It is about time!"
     5%       20%      80%   Remains as a hostile monster.
                             "You disturbed me, fool!"
If the potion had been quaffed by a monster, you will only get a peaceful
or vanishing djinni.  NOTE: There is no way to get a wish from the djinni
other than the first outcome above.

In a similar manner, potions with the appearance "milky" may summon a ghost.
Each time you or another monster quaff a milky potion, there is a chance
of creating a ghost, depending on the number of ghosts that have already
been created in the game:
  GHOSTS:  0     1     2     3     4     5        n       >=120
  PROB:   1/13  1/15  1/17  1/19  1/21  1/23  1/(13+2*n)    0
When the ghost appears, the potion is used up.  If the potion was quaffed
by a monster, that monster is paralyzed for 3 turns.  Otherwise, if you
are unblind, you are paralyzed for 3 turns.

In either case, the effect of the potion does not take place (since there
was no actual potion in the bottle to drink).

There is a limit of 120 djinn (or ghosts) per game.  Beyond this limit,
they are extinct and no more can be created.


Cancelling and diluting potions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several ways to turn potions into water.  If potions of sickness,
see invisible, or fruit juice are hit by a wand or spell of cancellation,
they become uncursed potions of fruit juice, with the same amount of
dilution as before the cancellation.  Potions of oil and booze become
uncursed but otherwise remain the same.  Other potions will become uncursed
potions of water.

You can also change potions of blindness, confusion, or hallucination
into uncursed water -- or potions of sickness into fruit juice -- by
#dipping a unicorn horn into these potions.  Note that if you had
quaffed these potions, you would have suffered bad effects that could
have been cured by the unicorn horn in any case.  You can also #dip an
amethyst stone into booze to convert it into fruit juice ("a-methyst"
means not intoxicated.) In either of these cases, only one potion
will be converted, regardless of the number of potions in the inventory
slot.

Finally, you can turn any potion except acid into water by #dipping it
into an uncursed potion of water or fountain (the latter may cause bad
effects as well).  If you are over a pool or moat but not levitating,
you can also #dip into that water.  Furthermore, if you swim under water
or fall into water, your potions have a chance of getting wet. If you
#dip a potion of acid or it gets wet it does 1 to 10 points of damage.

Getting potions wet happens in two stages.  After one dipping, the
potions will become diluted, but will have their same blessed state.
Diluted potions have exactly their same effects as undiluted potions
(with minor exceptions for booze and fruit juice).  Getting diluted
potions wet again then converts them into uncursed water.  Note that
water cannot be diluted.


Holy water
~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "water" by Maurice Vliege.)

Once you have potions of water, you can convert them to holy water at an
altar with your same alignment.  Drop any unholy water or uncursed water
that you wish to convert onto the altar, and #pray.  If your god was
pleased with you, they will all be converted to holy water.

To make unholy water, you must find an altar of a different alignment
than your own that is not in Gehennom.  Drop any holy water or uncursed
water that you wish to convert onto the altar, and #pray.  All of the
potions will be converted to unholy water.  It does not matter if your
god was pleased before, but your god will be upset after the prayer.

Holy and unholy water may also be found randomly, may appear in bones
piles from other characters, and can be wished for.  Holy water may be
part of your initial inventory (Priests start with four).  A more obscure
way to acquire holy or unholy water is to wield some uncursed potions of
water, take off all other worn items, and read a non-cursed scroll of
remove curse while confused.  You have a 25% chance of creating holy
water and 25% chance of creating unholy water this way, and it doesn't
need any altars! Blessed scrolls of remove curse will have the same
effect on each item in your inventory individually (try splitting
up the water into different slots by #naming); be careful of other
items in inventory becoming cursed.

Once you have holy water, you can uncurse any cursed item or bless any
uncursed items by the dipping the item into a potion of holy water.
Similarly, dipping a blessed item into unholy water makes it uncursed, and
dipping an uncursed item into unholy water makes it cursed. (Dipping a
blessed item into holy water or a cursed item into unholy water doesn't
do anything in particular: "Interesting...".) In all cases where the
status is changed, one of the potions of (un)holy water is used in the
process.  By dipping several uncursed potions of water into a potion of
(un)holy water, you can continue to make more (un)holy water indefinitely
(as long as you have uncursed water).

Dipping an item in holy or unholy water does NOT rust, blank, dilute,
or otherwise damage it.


Dipping and mixing potions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from a posting by Paul Brinkley.)

The effects of #dipping various objects into potions is summarized in the
table below.  You are first prompted for the item to be DIPPED, and then
the potion to dip it INTO.  One of the potions dipped into will be used up,
unless there was no effect or the potions were cancelled by the dipping
(unicorn horn or amethyst).  Except where shown, it doesn't matter if
potions are diluted before dipping.

You can mix two non-water potions (or groups of potions) of different types
by dipping one into the other; this procedure is commonly referred to as
"alchemy".  There is a 10% chance of an explosion (always if the DIPPED is
cursed or acid) which makes you breathe vapors of the DIPPED potion, abuses
your strength, and makes you lose one of each potion.  Otherwise, the
DIPPED potion(s) may become a different type of potion, which will always
be uncursed and diluted, and you use up one of the INTO potions.  The
possible mixtures are also described in the table below.

  DIPPED             INTO               RESULT
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~

Rings are listed in increasing order of base COST, then alphabetically
by name.  WGT specifies the weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).

Rings comprise 3% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
5% in containers, 5% on the Rogue level, and 8% in hell.  PROB is
the relative probability of each subtype; the suffix specifies the chance
of blessed/cursed:
    c           90% cursed, 10% uncursed, 0% blessed
    charged     42.93% cursed, 41.33% uncursed, 15.73% blessed
                Courtesy of Bruce Cox:
                                  +ve      +0       -ve
                   blessed   181/1200   1/240    7/3000   =  59/375
                   uncursed       1/3    1/60    19/300   =   31/75
                   cursed     19/1200   1/240   307/750   = 161/375
    otherwise   10% cursed, 90% uncursed, 0% blessed
Rings of invisibility carried by Nazguls are always cursed.

The CHG field is Y if the ring can be charged.  The initial enchantment
has an exponentially-weighted probability, but tends to be in the range
of -3 to +3.  When a ring with a positive enchantment is charged, it
has an (enchantment before) in 7 chance of exploding.  Rings with
enchantments of <= -5 or >= +7 will always explode when charged.
Otherwise, blessed charging adds 1 to 3 points of enchantment, cursed
charging removes 1 to 2 points, and uncursed charging always adds +1.
Therefore, the highest possible enchantment is +9 by charging (and +10
by random generation).  You may repeatedly enchant and unenchant a ring.

The effects of rings are controllable by putting on and removing the
ring.  Most rings will confer an intrinsic or a combat or stat
modifier; see rint-343.txt and drgn-343.txt for descriptions of the
intrinsics involved. It is possible to obtain an effect permanently by
polymorphing into a metallivore or gelatinous cube (depending on the
appearance of the ring; see below) and eating the ring.  There is only
a 1/3 chance of obtaining the effect this way ("Magic spreads through
your body as you digest the ring.").  Note that the effect of eating
rings that affect stats (gain constitution, gain strength, adornment)
will not persist when you change from this form. Eating a ring of free
action will confer sleep resistance instead.  Rings of slow digestion
may not be eaten ("This ring is indigestible!").

Meat rings have no effect when worn, but can be eaten as normal food
(see food-343.txt). The appearances of other rings are randomized from
the following descriptions.
These can be eaten by any metallivore (rock mole, rust monster, or xorn):
    pearl       iron        twisted     steel       wire
    engagement  shiny
The following can additionally be eaten by metallivores not restricted to
rustprone metals (rock mole or xorn):
    bronze      brass       copper      silver      gold
The following can be eaten by gelatinous cubes:
    wooden
These appearances cannot be eaten by any monster:
    granite     opal        clay        coral       black onyx
    moonstone   tiger eye   jade        agate       topaz
    sapphire    ruby        diamond     ivory       emerald
You can determine the appearance of already identified rings using the
discoveries command (\).

Wearing a ring (other than a chargeable ring at +0) will increase the
rate at which you get hungry; see food-343.txt.


Identifying rings using sinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a ring is dropped on top of a sink, you will get a message that
can help you identify the ring.  Note that most messages require that
you are not blind, and the ring of hunger requires that there is a
(preferably worthless) object already on the sink; if these are not the
case, you will just get "You hear the ring bouncing down the drain pipe."
Except for the rings of searching and slow digestion, there is a 95% chance
that the ring will fall down the drain and you will lose it forever.

Ring intrinsics in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

This spoiler covers all intrinsics that may be granted by wearing rings,
other than the dragon resistances already dealt with in drgn-343.txt:
how to acquire them (in addition to their ring source), how to lose them,
and what effects they have. Note that, as a general rule, any intrinsics
acquired solely by experience level can be lost by being drained below
that level.

aggravate monster
  acquired by
    Wearing or eating a ring of aggravate monster.
    Eating a corpse of your own natural race (werecorpses and Kops count as
    human), or a little dog, dog, large dog, kitten, housecat or large cat;
    Cave(wo)men and orcs are exempt from this.
    Sacrificing a former pet.
    Intrinsic aggravate monster may be lost by night-time gremlin attack.
      "You feel less attractive."
  effects
    Mistreated pets become untame more quickly.
    Sleeping monsters (other than leprechauns, nymphs, and jabberwocks)
    will always wake up at your approach unless you are stealthy.

cold resistance
  [See drgn-343.txt]

conflict
  acquired by
    Wearing or eating a ring of conflict.
    #invoking the Sceptre of Might (Cave(wo)man Quest Artifact).

    Increases hunger rate by 50% of normal (except from Sceptre).
    Nearby monsters in line of sight may attack each other instead of you.
    Even peaceful monsters and pets may attack you.

    Monsters lose restraint in attacking *trices.
    Pets lose restraint in attacking peaceful monsters.
    Mistreated pets become untame more quickly.
    d4 hostile Angels created on Astral Plane in place of tame guardian
    Angel.

fire resistance
  [See drgn-343.txt]

free action
  acquired by

    resistance.)
  effects
    Protects against paralysis attacks of gelatinous cubes, guardian nagas,
    ghouls, shades, and Yeenoghu.
    Protects against passive paralysis attacks of gelatinous cubes and
    floating eyes.

    to one turn.
    Protects against quaffed or thrown potions of paralysis or sleeping.
    Protects against paralysis effect of chest traps.
    Protects against self-paralysis from looking into a mirror as a
    floating eye.

hunger
 acquired by
   Wearing or eating a ring of hunger.
 effects
   Increases hunger rate by 50% of normal.

invisibility
  acquired by
    Wearing or eating a ring of invisibility.
    Wearing a cloak of invisibility.
