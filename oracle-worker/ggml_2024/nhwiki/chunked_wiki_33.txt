Since the more powerful liches are covetous (warping back and forth from the up stairs), the general [[Covetous#Strategy|strategy]] for dealing with covetous monsters applies here. If you have [[teleport control]], you can teleport to the up stairs before it does.

Liches can be prevented from warping by wielding a [[potion of paralysis]], and hitting them with it while wearing a [[ring of free action]]. This should provide enough time to be able to dispose of them while they are paralyzed.

The best way to deal with a lich is to wield Magicbane to prevent the lich from cursing your inventory and make you resistant to the [[touch of death]]. Another way is to use [[Elbereth]] or a scroll of [[scare monster]] to prevent the lich from touching you. These strategies will still leave you potentially open to attacks from the nasties that the liches summon. However, summoning is not always bad. A strong character wielding Magicbane might allow liches to continuously summon nasties to kill for gear, exp, or a full-on extinction run.

Because the three lower lich types don't resist shock damage, [[Mjollnir]] is an excellent weapon to deal with them. If Mjollnir is not available, the [[Fire Brand]] will work on them as well. Arch-liches resist most elements, so there is no quick way to take them down, except by hitting them with a [[cockatrice]] or chickatrice corpse (don't forget to wear gloves), which will turn them to stone immediately. All liches can also be [[disintegration|disintegrated]] by [[black dragon]] [[breath]] or [[digestion|digested]] by a [[purple worm]].

All types of lich are [[undead]] and can be pacified by reading the blessed [[Book of the Dead]]. If you're [[chaotic]], the lower two ranks can also be tamed this way.

==As pets==

Liches can make acceptable pets, but have their disadvantages. They are essentially useless against cold resistant monsters and are dangerous to abandon. The stronger versions will also always stay next to the player, which is useful if you don't have a [[magic whistle]] but also can be a nuisance by them getting in the way, and makes it difficult to stop them from killing [[aligned priest]]s and [[shopkeepers]]. Master liches and arch-liches cannot be tamed directly due to their [[covetous]] nature, but it's possible to [[polymorph]] another pet into one, or to tame a lich or demilich and have it [[Growing_up|grow up]].

==Origin==

Liches are powerful spellcasters, often magicians or kings, who seek to defy death by magical means. They are depicted as being clearly cadaverous, bodies desiccated or completely skeletal, with glowing lights in place of their eyes.

Lich means "corpse" or "body" in several Germanic languages (compare e.g. Dutch ''lichaam'' and German ''Leiche''), and survives in Modern English in the word "lichgate" (or "lych-gate", etc.), a covered entranceway to a churchyard. Nothing to do with "leech".

{{encyclopedia|
But on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant, I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless, shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us, and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems, reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .

'''Excalibur''' is an [[intelligent]] [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[lawful]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[long sword]].

==Generation==
Excalibur cannot be randomly generated or granted as a sacrifice gift, though it can still be left behind in [[bones]]. Excalibur's entry in the [[artifact]] code indicates that it would be the first sacrifice gift for [[Knight]]s if it were able to be gifted.{{refsrc|include/artilist.h|47|nethack=3.6.7|comment=the flag following alignment governs which role receives an artifact as a first gift}}

Excalibur can be obtained if a lawful character is either [[crowned]] or creates the artifact by [[dipping]] a single un[[name]]d, non-artifact long sword into a [[fountain]] while they are at least [[experience level]] 5.{{refsrc|src/fountain.c|372|nethack=3.6.7|comment=the case accounts for polypiling (e.g. a stack of [[dagger]]s) that can produce a stack of long swords}}

===Dipping===
{{main|Fountain#Dipping|l1=Fountain dipping}}
Each time you dip a long sword as a lawful character, there is a {{frac|6}} chance that instead of normal fountain effects, the sword will be transformed into Excalibur: This will [[exercise]] [[wisdom]], [[bless]] and [[rustproof]] the sword while removing any [[Erosion|rust or corrosion]], and carry over its previous enchantment, but this does ''not'' unrestrict the long sword skill.{{refsrc|src/fountain.c|385|nethack=3.6.7}} Dipping for Excalibur when not lawful instead has a {{frac|6}} chance of removing erodeproofing and cursing the long sword, as well as abusing wisdom.{{refsrc|src/fountain.c|375|nethack=3.6.6}} The fountain will always disappear after either event.{{refsrc|src/fountain.c|401|nethack=3.6.7}}

===Crowning===
{{main|Crowning}}
If a lawful character is [[crowned]] while wielding a non-artifact long sword in their primary hand, and Excalibur has not yet been generated, the sword will be transformed into the blessed and rustproof Excalibur as the crowning gift. This auto-identifies the sword and unrestricts the long sword skill if applicable; if the sword has no positive enchantment at the time of crowning, its enchantment is set to +1.

==Description==
Excalibur adds +d5 [[to-hit]] and +d10 damage against all monsters, and confers [[drain resistance]], [[automatic searching]], and an [[enchantment]]-based bonus to manual [[searching]] for secret doors and secret corridors (up to a maximum of +5). However, while wielded, demon princes will be generated hostile, and every monster can track your location whether it has eyes or not. - though due to how monster pathfinding works in ''NetHack'', the impact of this is negligible.

===Demon princes===
If Excalibur is wielded when a [[demon prince]] is generated, the demon prince will be generated as hostile rather than peaceful. If you are wielding Excalibur when a demon prince warps to you and wants to demand a bribe, they will also turn hostile.

==Strategy==
Excalibur is an excellent weapon against all monsters and is generally only outperformed by a highly-enchanted [[Grayswandir]], making it more than sufficient for an [[ascension kit]] at [[Basic]] skill level; in the later stages of the game, even unskilled use of Excalibur can provide sufficient offense while training the skill, particularly with [[scroll]]s of {{? of|enchant weapon}}.

Generating Excalibur is easy for Knights and lawful [[Valkyrie]]s, who both start with an enchanted long sword. It is also a stellar weapon for [[Samurai]], who can create it once they find a long sword and will already have the skill available. Lawfuls restricted in long sword can unrestrict the skill and receive Excalibur via crowning, which can be done fairly early (usually before the [[Quest]]) if they are not reliant on prayer; they can also receive another artifact long sword as sacrifice gift to unrestrict the skill.

===Cross-aligned use===
Though Excalibur is an intelligent artifact, it is not a quest artifact and so will not evade the grasp of non-lawful characters, allowing them to make good use of it if they can manage the [[artifact blast]]s. While bones are the typical means for a non-lawful character to acquire Excalibur, they may also consider either [[wish]]ing for Excalibur or using a [[helm of opposite alignment]] to temporarily become lawful and dip for it. For dipping, chaotic characters are capable of reliably using the helm of opposite alignment, where neutral characters may need to try a few helms before finding one that turns them lawful.{{refsrc|src/do_wear.c|418|nethack=3.6.7}}

The rare drain resistance property and bonuses to damage and to-hit make Excalibur an enticing artifact for non-lawfuls with an extra wish to spare; chaotic characters in particular have a relative dearth of quality artifact wishes compared to other alignments. However, for a weaker character early wishes are typically best spent on covering the essentials, and crowning for [[Vorpal Blade]] or Stormbringer may be a preferable alternative to obtain a reliable weapon.

===Dipping===
Acquiring Excalibur as soon as possible is generally a good idea, but the chance of obtaining it is only {{frac|6}} for each dip. You should be prepared to deal with [[water demon]]s, [[water nymph]]s, [[water moccasin]]s and newly-made [[moat]]s in the meantime. Some people prefer to wait until at least XL 7 before making the attempt: Knights, Valkyries and Cavemen gain [[intrinsic speed]] at level 7, which allows them to outrun water demons.

Your sword will also [[rust]] on each dip that does not transform it into Excalibur. Though succeeding will repair and rustproof the sword, it is best to wait if the long sword being dipped is your primary weapon - once you have found a few fountains, you can backtrack to them and try each one in turn rather than continue searching new floors with a thoroughly rusted long sword as your only weapon.

Generating Excalibur successfully will '''always''' make the fountain that was used dry up and disappear. In [[Minetown]], there is no warning for this and the [[watch]] will immediately be angered, making dipping out in the open a [[Bad Idea]]. If you somehow do not have access to any other fountains, consider using a pet to kill the guards in advance, or lock them up in rooms where they cannot attack you.

The [[Oracle]] level is a popular place to dip for Excalibur; characters often arrive there at about the time that they are capable of escaping fountain hazards, and having four adjacent fountains means you will likely succeed without having to travel much further to find more.

The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a blessed weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

==History==
Excalibur first appears in [[NetHack 1.3d]]. In this version and [[NetHack 1.4f]], you can [[name]] a long sword Excalibur and ''then'' dip it in a fountain, which is guaranteed to create the artifact; this Excalibur lacks special properties, but creating it this way raises the enchantment of the sword to +5 (if possible), rustproofs it and removes any [[curse]]s. The modern dipping method for obtaining Excalibur is introduced in [[NetHack 2.2a]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}
Excalibur is the legendary sword of [[King Arthur]], who appears in NetHack as the Knight's [[quest leader]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], bonus damage rolls for artifact weapons are converted to a flat bonus, giving Excalibur +10 to damage.<ref>Compare [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/artifact.c#line799]] to [[artifact.c#line843]]</ref> This makes the already-good artifact weapon even better, and the abundance of [[life drain]]ing methods and attacks introduced in SLASH'EM make its drain resistance even more valuable.

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], only Knights can obtain Excalibur by dipping; other lawful characters must use one of the other remaining methods. This makes [[Snickersnee]], which can be randomly generated, somewhat more useful in comparison.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Excalibur adds +1d20 to-hit and deals an extra 3d7 damage to demons and undead if blessed. In addition, Excalibur inherits [[Object properties#dNetHack|the weapon]] and [[Object materials (dNetHack)|material properties]] of the sword it is made with; players may want to put off dipping for Excalibur until they obtain a desirable base sword. Outside of [[wish]]ing, sources of such swords include:

* A [[barrow wight]]'s guaranteed long sword has a {{frac|5}} chance to be [[silver]] (which adds 1d20 silver damage) and a {{frac|5}} chance to be gold (which adds 1d20 holy damage). In addition, 5% of barrow wight long swords will be lesser holy (+1d8 holy) as well.
* [[Oona]]'s long sword has +1d8 elemental damage, +1d8 damage vs. chaotic and neutral targets.
* The [[Sword of the Deeps]] is a +12 deep long sword found in the last level of the [[Lethe Waterway]].
* King Arthur has an axiomatic long sword (double damage vs. chaotic and neutral targets), though it cannot be obtained normally unless you are a Knight willing to attack and possibly kill him.
* [[Nazgul]] are always generated with an unholy long sword (double unholy damage).

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], obtaining Excalibur by dipping a long sword into a fountain will set its enchantment to +0 if it was negative, and will always convert the sword's [[Object materials (xNetHack)|object material]] to iron. Obtaining Excalibur by crowning sets its enchantment to +3 if it was lower than that.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], only lawful Knights can dip for Excalibur as in SporkHack - other lawful roles can only obtain it through crowning, bones or wishing, and the helm of opposite alignment cannot be used by chaotic Knights to dip. There is the added a risk of the long sword rusting away completely when dipping, as with any sufficiently-eroded object. [[Orcish long sword|Orcish]] and [[elven long sword]]s cannot be used to create Excalibur in either instance.

A long sword that is successfully transformed into Excalibur is stripped of its object properties, and its [[object materials (EvilHack)|object material]] is always converted to iron. You cannot obtain

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], Excalibur can be invoked to create an explosion if the wielder is carrying [[Avalon]].

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
At first only its tip was visible, but then it rose, straight,
proud, all that was noble and great and wondrous.  The tip of
the blade pointed toward the moon, as if it would cleave it
in two.  The blade itself gleamed like a beacon in the night.
There was no light source for the sword to be reflecting
from, for the moon had darted behind a cloud in fear.  The
sword was glowing from the intensity of its strength and
power and knowledge that it was justice incarnate, and that
after a slumber of uncounted years its time had again come.
After the blade broke the surface, the hilt was visible, and
holding the sword was a single strong, yet feminine hand,
wearing several rings that bore jewels sparkling with the
blue-green color of the ocean.

'''Snickersnee''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[lawful]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[katana]].

Snickersnee deals an extra +1d8 damage to monsters.

==Generation==
Snickersnee is the first guaranteed [[sacrifice gift]] for a [[Samurai]].

==Strategy==
Snickersnee is a serviceable, if generally unremarkable, artifact weapon - it has marginally lower damage on average compared to [[Excalibur]], with lower to-hit bonuses and no additional properties. While outclassed by Excalibur and many other artifact weapons, it is still decent as a first artifact weapon for Samurai and other lawful characters, and can at least tide them over until you are prepped to dip for Excalibur or transition to another artifact weapon.

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

|}

==History==
Snickersnee first appears in [[NetHack 2.2a]]; in 2.2a and [[NetHack 2.3e]], any katana could be [[name]]d Snickersnee, and it had a +d5 damage bonus against all monsters.{{refsrc|fight.c|399|version=NetHack 2.3e}} Artifacts were made unique in [[NetHack 3.0.0]], the version where Snickersnee was given its current traits.

==Origin==
Snickersnee is derived from ''[[wikipedia:The Mikado|The Mikado]]'', a popular 19th century comic opera set in Japan. Its name is actually an old English word for "large knife".

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], due to artifact weapon changes Snickersnee now has a flat +8 damage bonus, making it significantly more powerful than in vanilla. Additionally, since artifacts can be #[[twoweapon]]ed, a Samurai who finds a long sword can get easy access to both Excalibur and Snickersnee, which makes for a formidable combination well into the late game.

|}

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Snickersnee is an intelligent artifact [[knife]] with +1d3 to-hit, +1d10 to damage, and a chance of beheading similar to [[Vorpal Blade]]. It cannot be gifted, but is nameable by mid-game [[Tourist]]s; [[Kiku-ichimonji]] also replaces Snickersnee as the Samurai's first gift. Both Tourists and Samurai can wield it in the [[twoweapon|off-hand]].

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], in addition to keeping SLASH'EM changes, Snickersnee can be be made at [[The Forge]]. Kiku-ichimonji replaces Snickersnee as the first sacrifice gift for Samurai, as with dNetHack.

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], Snickersnee gains +1d5 to hit (in addition to the +1 for being a [[katana]]), but is otherwise unchanged. This is more significant than it might initially seem because of the to-hit calculation changes in SporkHack.

'''Cleaver''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Its [[base item]] is a [[battle-axe]], and it is [[neutral]]-aligned. It is the guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Barbarian]]s.

==Description==
Cleaver has a [[D notation|+d3]] [[to-hit]] bonus and does an extra +d6 damage per hit. Uniquely, it can hit multiple monsters in an arc with one swing: each attack will first strike the monster 45 degrees to one side of your target, then the targeted monster, and then the monster 45 degrees to the other side. The direction of attack alternates with each swing.{{reffunc|uhitm.c|hitum_cleave|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} The arc '''does not''' discriminate between hostile monsters and [[pet]]s or [[peaceful]] monsters. If attacking while held or engulfed, you can only hit the monster holding or engulfing you.

Like other [[axe]]s, [[apply]]ing Cleaver in a given direction can chop down [[trees]] and destroy [[door]]s.

==Strategy==
Cleaver's arc attack potentially makes it one of the most damaging weapons in the game by a pure damage-per-second calculation. Moreover, it is most effective in "one vs. many" scenarios, which are also the most dangerous situations for a player to find themselves in. Cleaver's arced strikes can help you in these situations by opening gaps to flee through or to reposition yourself in.

Because your pets are just as much endangered by Cleaver's attack as hostile monsters, it may be prohibitively difficult to keep them around. A [[magic whistle]] can help orient them "properly" before you attack, as can blocking them off using doors or cursed items if you are aware of the potential for combat beforehand. Slower pets such as [[dragon]]s and [[balrog]]s are easier to work with, as you can move a few steps away before attacking.

For the same reason, this weapon is also extremely dangerous to wield in peaceful-populated areas such as the [[Quest]], [[Minetown]], [[shop]]s, and [[temple]]s - it is particularly advisable to use a different weapon while [[altar]]-scumming with a co-[[aligned priest]] in the room. In general, combat with Cleaver proves far easier if you can lure your foes away from peaceful targets.

As a two-handed non-[[intelligent artifact]] weapon, Cleaver risks being welded to your hands if it becomes cursed. The usual strategies for two-handed weapons apply: make sure to keep some keep curse removal items on hand, including carrying [[holy water]] in a spare sack to #[[tip]] out if necessary.

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

|}

==History==
Cleaver's striking arc is introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.1]], and was adapted from [[FIQHack]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
Like all artifacts with damage bonuses (as opposed to double damage), Cleaver receives a boost in [[SLASH'EM]]; it always gives +3 to hit and +6 damage. However, the above strategies regarding two-handed weapons still apply, especially given the proliferation of item-cursing spellcasters in SLASH'EM&mdash;[[ghoul mage]]s, [[nabassu]]s, [[vampire mage]]s, [[deva]]s, and the like. Since SLASH'EM is based on NetHack 3.4.3, Cleaver does not attack monsters in an arc.

However, note that non-human Barbarians have a second guaranteed sacrifice gift in SLASH'EM: [[Deathsword]]. This weapon is only particularly effective against humans; for that reason, it mostly gets in the way of getting a better weapon, and some barbarians may find themselves using Cleaver for longer than they might want.

Given that {{frac|3}} of neutral sacrifice gifts are non-weapons ([[Deluder]], [[Gauntlets of Defense]], [[Mirrorbright]], and [[Whisperfeet]]) and another {{frac|4}} are of limited use ([[Disrupter]] vs. non-undead, [[Giantkiller]] vs. non-giants, and [[Sword of Balance]] vs. neutrals), a neutral player who receives Cleaver early should consider himself lucky; only [[Magicbane]] and [[Mjollnir]] are more powerful as general-use neutral weapons, particularly in the early and midgame where curses are not a significant threat.

===UnNetHack===
Cleaver in [[UnNetHack]] behaves as in 3.6.1, and is also easier to obtain. The [[Executioner]] is guaranteed to be generated with Cleaver if it has not yet appeared in-game

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], Cleaver has the ability to hit multiple foes, and the behavior was adapted for vanilla; however, it will not hit pets or peacefuls unless they are directly targeted.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]]'s latest version, whether you will attack a peaceful monster in Cleaver's arc depends on whether you pressed {{kbd|F}} prior to the attack; as it does with other attacks, it allows you to attack a peaceful monster without a query. If you do not press {{kbd|F}} before the attack, the arc will not include peaceful monsters.<ref>https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack/commit/10017fc13b9ea549dabde7e2251bea24957e94cc</ref>

==Description==
Wearing gauntlets of power grants 1 AC and sets your [[strength]] to 25 regardless of [[beatitude]], [[auto-identify]]ing them. They apply a -2 [[to-hit]] penalty when shooting from a [[bow]]. Strength cannot be [[exercise]]d while wearing gauntlets of power, although actual strength increases will still occur as normal.

[[Mjollnir]] can only be thrown by a character with 25 strength, which for all practical purposes requires gauntlets of power. As iron gloves, they interfere with [[spellcasting]].

Monsters wearing gauntlets of power add 3-6 damage to their [[weapon]] attacks, with no effect on monsters that cannot wield weapons.{{refsrc|src/mhitm.c|987|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
{{main|Strength}}
Strength increases [[carrying capacity]], the chance for attacks to hit, the damage of melee attacks and projectile attacks not involving a [[launcher]], and the range of projectiles other than fired [[crossbow bolt]]s. However, you can obtain most of these benefits from reaching 18/** strength through other means; the  only further benefits from gauntlets of power in that case are increased carrying capacity, projectile range, and the ability to throw Mjollnir.

While neither necessary to the point of using a [[wish]] nor commonplace in [[ascension kit]]s, gauntlets of power are still a viable choice of armor for the long term. [[Wizard]]s may still want to wear them to shore up their strength, despite them being metal: A wizard wearing neither a [[robe]] nor any other metal armor will have a 4% general spell [[Spellcasting#Calculating spell success rate|failure rate]] with 18 [[intelligence]], or 3% with 19 or higher intelligence, which may be acceptably low.

Less adept casters may experience a much greater increase in spell failure rates, and as such those planning to utilize spells often or in-combat may want different gloves. Conversely, those dedicated to non-magical combat such as [[Barbarian]]s may prefer gauntlets of power; a strength level of 18/01 or above makes the bonuses of gauntlets of power somewhat more marginal, and is also easy to obtain for non-elven characters.

For characters considering replacing their gauntlets of power at a later point, it may benefit them to remove these gloves while actively or passively training strength (e.g., solving [[Sokoban]]), unless doing so severely impacts combat performance.

===Identification===
Gauntlets of power will always auto-identify when worn; they are additionally the only gloves to weigh 30 [[aum]]. Being made of iron allows them to be distinguished from other gloves without wearing them - using a [[touchstone]] on unidentified gauntlets of power will produce its distinctive "scritch, scritch" noise.

==History==
Gauntlets of power were first added in [[NetHack 3.0.0]]. The extra damage for monster weapon attacks was added in [[NetHack 3.6.1]].{{refsrc|src/mhitm.c|920|nethack=3.6.1}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], gauntlets of power instead set your strength to 18/**, and further modify it based on the gauntlets' enchantment: a +1 pair will give you 19 strength, while a -1 pair will give you 18/99. Valkyries can safely enchant gauntlets of power up to +7, which allows them to gain the 25 strength required to throw Mjollnir.

'''Gauntlets of dexterity''', often abbreviated to '''GoD''', are a type of [[gloves]] that appear in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are made of [[leather]], and wearing them provides 1 point of [[AC]] and modifies the wearer's [[dexterity]] based on its [[enchantment]], up to a maximum of 25. Wearing gauntlets of dexterity of any non-zero enchantment [[auto-identify|auto-identifies]] them.

==Generation==
[[Player monster]]s on the [[Astral Plane]] that do not generate with a [[war hammer]] have a {{frac|7|8}} chance of generating wearing a random pair of gloves, with a {{frac|4}} chance for those gloves to be gauntlets of dexterity - effectively, there is a {{frac|7|32}} or ~21.9% chance for a player monster to carry these gauntlets.{{refsrc|src/mplayer.c|289|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} 

==Strategy==
Higher dexterity improves a player's chances of hitting with spells and attacks, but most players can maximize their chances to hit successfully through other means, particularly weapon [[skill]] and [[Luck]]. As such, gauntlets of dexterity are somewhat fairly uncommon, especially in [[ascension kit]]s where [[leather gloves]] often suffice. Gauntlets of dexterity can still be of use to spellcasters seeking to improve their hit rates on [[attack spell]]s such as {{Spell of|magic missile}} and {{Spell of|finger of death}} - [[Monk]]s may prefer them both for general use with martial arts and to help offset the -20 [[to-hit]] penalty should they choose to wear [[body armor]].

Other uses for these gauntlets include hitting with a [[thrown]] [[cockatrice egg]] or a [[potion of paralysis]], whose odds of hitting cannot be improved by anything but a high dexterity score - even with 23 Dexterity, however, there is a 12% chance of missing, and hitting with a [[wield]]ed egg or potion in melee is still more reliable, if you can afford it.

==History==
Gauntlets of dexterity first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], dexterity improves your AC at higher values, making gauntlets of dexterity much more attractive to the point that they may feature in ascension kits. It is debatable whether they are worth spending a [[wish]] on, since you can obtain them by [[upgrading]] leather gloves (which will become either these or [[gauntlets of swimming]]).

[[The Gauntlets of Defense]] are a [[neutral]] pair of [[artifact]] gauntlets of dexterity that provide [[half physical damage]] when worn and can be [[invoked]] to toggle [[invisibility]].

===NetHack brass===
In [[NetHack brass]], gauntlets of dexterity set the wearer's dexterity to their race or role's maximum similar to [[gauntlets of power]], and they will always auto-identify when worn.

===dNetHack===
[[dNetHack]] also has SLASH'EM-styled bonuses to AC, and female [[Drow (starting race)|droven]] [[Anachrononaut]]s start with a +1 pair of gauntlets of dexterity. dNetHack also contains two sets of artifact gauntlets of dexterity:

* [[Shield of the Resolute Heart]], an unaligned artifact that can be enchanted to +7 - they confer half physical damage when worn and can be invoked to bless and repair themselves, also raising the enchantment to +3 if it is below that threshold
* [[The Claws of the Revenancer]], a neutral [[crowning]] gift that is also made of silver, and has several effects related to [[life drain]]ing and [[undead]].

===SlashTHEM===
In addition to SLASH'EM changes, [[SlashTHEM]] adds [[The Pickpocket's Gloves]], a pair of [[chaotic]] artifact gauntlets of dexterity - they confer [[stealth]] and [[automatic searching]] while worn, and additionally provide a +20 bonus to stealing from monsters via the [[borrow]] [[extended command]].

===EvilHack===
In [[Evilhack]], thees gauntlets are somewhat more desirable compared to ''[[NetHack]]'' - dexterity functions similarly to SLASH'EM, though the bonuses only apply while unburdened.

Gauntlets of dexterity are generated as part of various kits for player monsters, including [[centaur]]s and [[Monk (player monster)|monks]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L247 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 322470]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L365 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 365]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L382 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 382]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L418 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 418]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L427 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 427]</ref>

&&%s&& %s Gnomish Mines {149770 2023-01-14T17:26:47Z {4000867 K2} /* Strategy */ light sources The '''Gnomish Mines''' is a [[branch]] of the main dungeon, usually used by adventurers to gain [[experience]] and useful [[tool]]s. The Mines consist of eight or nine levels in total, including the special levels of [[Minetown]] and [[Mines' End]].

==Generation==
The Gnomish Mines will always generate somewhere on [[dungeon level]]s 2-4, and are eligible to leave [[bones]] with the exception of scenarios where the top level is on DL 3 (which is too shallow to qualify); all levels can still load bones.

With the exception of Minetown and Mines' End, all the levels are simple caverns containing 7 {{monsymlink|gnome}}s, 2 {{monsym|dwarf}} [[Dwarf (monster)|dwarves]], a {{monsymlink|gnome lord}}, 2 random {{white|G}} [[gnome (monster class)|gnomes]] and one random {{white|h}} [[humanoid]].<ref>This {{white|h}} can occasionally be a [[minesflayer|mind flayer]], even if it's out of depth.</ref> They will have 6 random [[trap]]s, one tool, 3 random [[gem]]s or piles of gems, and 3 [[item|random objects]]. Typically, any random {{white|h}} will be [[lawful]] and any random {{white|G}} will be [[neutral]]. These filler levels have a 50% chance each of being dark.

==Strategy==
Player [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomes]] and [[dwarves]] entering the Mines will usually be left alone by the native gnomes and dwarves. Likewise, lawful [[Human (starting race)|humans]] will often be ignored by the dwarves, although the gnomes will still be hostile to neutral humans.

The Mines are rich in tools, loot, and other resources, but also very dangerous to the unprepared. It is easy to get in over your head in this environment of traps and large open spaces. (Try hitting a trap door, another trap door, and then a polymorph trap in quick succession. Now you're a [[newt]] surrounded by an angry mob, unable to move and armor on the floor). The mines can set you well on the way to success, but you have to learn how to move cautiously, and be willing to back off and try again later rather than press on to a glorious death.

The following tips are geared towards the newer player, who is apt to have the most trouble in the mines, and will apply more to human, orcish, and elven characters than to dwarves and gnomes.

Some general pointers will help make your biggest problem in [[Minetown]] where to put all your loot:

*Make judicious use of [[Elbereth]]. New players are most likely to run into trouble in the mines, and new players often haven't really ''absorbed'' the power of the E-Word. Mine denizens will generally respect Elbereth and avoid attacking you hand-to-hand. You still have to worry about missiles and spells, but Elbereth can be a lifesaver none the less. Read the article on this carefully--engraving with fingers is fast but not durable, engraving with blades, when done correctly, is semi-permanent but slow. Use the ":" command to inspect your handiwork without eroding the letters.
*Use stairs to control the crowds. You will tend to get swarmed as you enter each new level. Stay close to the upstairs--stay '''on''' the upstairs if you can--and run upstairs to heal if you are in trouble. And of course you can engrave Elbereth on the stairs.
*Keep your [[pet]] nearby. Your pet is a tremendous resource in the early game in general, and in the mines, even more so. Your pet is very possibly stronger in a fight than you are right now, is willing to attack peaceful monsters (which means you get their stuff), and is absolutely invaluable for curse-testing the weapons and armor you pick up. If you are separated from your pet, for example by a trap door, make getting back to it a priority. You may very well find a [[leash]] in the mines--use it.
*Avoid traps. The mines are loaded with them, and they can just ruin your game. Watch where other creatures walk (including your pet) and try to limit your travels to those squares only. If you are not starving, search before stepping on uncertain squares. You can even engrave with your fingers to mark out safe passages through the levels if you are weak and one good arrow trap could mean the end.
*Be careful of [[gray stone]]s. This applies everywhere, of course, but such stones are more common in the mines. Kick any gray stone before picking it up, or else you might get a [[load stone]], which can be a real pain.

Conceptually, it can be helpful to divide the Mines into four stages. When you mount an expedition into the mines, understand your objective and act accordingly.

*The first stage is an initial reconnaissance of the first level. You will be greeted by a pack of gnomes and probably a dwarf or two, most of whom will be carrying gear that you want. The point of this short sortie is not to clear out the first level, but to score a few quick kills and grab some loot (including yummy corpses if you need the food and are of an appropriate race to eat them). Depending on how hard the fight is, you can escape back into the main dungeon and use your pet to curse-test your new possessions. A typical recon of the mines can net you a [[helmet]], [[boots]], a supply of [[dagger]]s or other missiles, and, if you are lucky, such items as a [[mithril coat]] or [[pickaxe]]. The haul may make you sufficiently strong to attempt further explorations of the mines.
*The second stage is the upper mines as far as [[Minetown]]. These levels can vary a great deal in difficulty, so you have to watch your stats and not get overwhelmed. Levels may be dark, which makes them considerably tougher, so that should affect your calculations as well. Clear out levels methodically, avoiding traps and accumulating loot. You will have more armor and weapons than you can carry and you will want to consolidate them into piles as you go down, partly to keep new monsters from using them, and partly to sell to the [[shopkeepers]] in Minetown if you are short on cash. Keep using your pet to check loot, and trade up on weapons and armor as you go.
*The third stage is [[Minetown]] itself. Minetown has its own rules and regulations, and you should be prepared for it by studying up. The hostile monsters here are not particularly harder than in the upper mines, and traps are fewer, but the [[watchmen|town watch]] is a complicating factor, particularly with respect to your pet. For whatever reason, pets have a habit of overestimating their abilities and attacking the watch, then getting themselves killed--and this is probably a big loss for you at this stage. So you may want to leash your pet, shut it in a room, or even leave it on the level above (but be careful about letting it go feral). You probably do not want to tangle with the watch yourself. The watch captain is strong and the penalties for [[murder]] may be unappealing to you. Once you've cleared out the hostiles, Minetown is a godsend for the weary explorer, with a guaranteed [[temple]] for testing items and buying protection, [[shops]] for buying, selling and price-identifying items, lockable rooms for protecting [[stash]]es, and other resources such as [[fountain]]s. Minetown may be your "base camp" for further explorations for a long time to come. If you are going to be moving into Minetown for a while, read up on [[stash]]es and take the time to set up a good one, perhaps buying a container in the shops, or even lugging one down from the main dungeon.
*The fourth stage is the lower mines, all the way to [[Mines' End]], and it is ''much'' more dangerous to most players than the upper mines. This danger is due to traps, which start to get particularly nasty. [[Polymorph]] traps can turn you into a weak monster or a gnome into a [[minotaur]]. Trap doors can cut you off from your pet and your escape path. Even if you swept through Minetown without much trouble, you may want to leave the lower mines until you have [[magic resistance]], and [[poison resistance]] is really a must-have. You may want to wear "junk" armor if you are not magic-resistant, so that those polymorph traps can't destroy your only mithril and your best cloak.

As you explore the mines, remember that a mines level is often substantially harder than a level of the main dungeon. A typical gambit is to go to the first level of the mines and grab a [[dwarvish mithril-coat]] from somebody there, then go down to the [[Oracle]] and level up along the way, then go back to the mines and continue to the end. Weak characters might prefer to do [[Sokoban]] before going deeper in the mines. Because many mines levels are dark, having a [[light source]] on hand can make exploration a much safer and faster endeavor.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], gnome and dwarf characters entering the Mines will find that the normally peaceful gnomes and dwarves have been transformed into hostile undead, with only a few survivors. When a map is generated when the player's race is gnomish and dwarvish, the respective NPCs are replaced with different monsters. Gnome players will find that gnome NPCs will become gnome zombies, gnomish wizards will become orc shamans, gnome lords will become gnome mummies, and gnome kings become ogres. Dwarven players have a similar formula, but the zombies and mummies will be of the dwarven variety, and dwarf kings will be replaced with [[war orc]]s.

=== FIQHack ===

In [[FIQHack]] the lighting is always consistent in the mines.  Upper levels are always lit, and lower levels are always dark.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Made by Dwarfs.  The Rule here is that the Mine is either long
deserted or at most is inhabited by a few survivors who will
make confused claims to have been driven out/decimated by humans/
other Dwarfs/Minions of the Dark Lord.  Inhabited or not, this
Mine will be very complex, with many levels of galleries,
beautifully carved and engineered.  What was being mined here
is not always evident, but at least some of the time it will
appear to have been Jewels, since it is customary to find
unwanted emeralds, etc., still embedded in the rock of the
walls.  Metal will also be present, but only when made up into
armor and weapons (_wondrous_).

&&%s&& %s Helm {126417 2019-07-30T03:31:38Z {4001313 Ardub23}  '''Helms''' are one of the seven slots for [[armor]]. Their primary use is protecting your head and cranium, especially against [[mind flayer]]s. The most popular helms to carry are [[helm of telepathy]], [[helm of brilliance]], and [[elven leather helm]]. [[Cornuthaum]]s are occasionally used by [[wizard]]s, and a [[helm of opposite alignment]] is often used on the [[ascension run]].

The helm of telepathy grants extrinsic [[telepathy]], similar to an [[amulet of ESP]]. The helm of brilliance will increase your [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]] by its enchantment, so +5 HoB and 18 Int and 17 Wis will produce 23 Int and 22 Wis. Elven leather helms can take a higher enchantment than other items and [[weight|weigh]] less than most other helms: 3 wt versus 50.

Of these, the visored helmet is always special. It protects against the blinding attack of ravens and the venom-spitting attack of cobras.

== Hard helms ==
Helms made of metal provide protection against falling objects, greatly reducing the damage taken from [[falling rock trap]]s, [[iron ball]]s, non-blessed [[Scroll of earth|scrolls of earth]], and objects you [[throw]] upward. The [[helm of brilliance]] is the only item providing this benefit without increasing spell failure rates.

A popular cloak to carry is the [[cloak of magic resistance]]. This provides [[magic resistance]] and [[magic cancellation]] of 1. If you already possess both magic resistance and [[reflection]], a [[cloak of displacement]] or a stealthy [[elven cloak]] may be used. Typically, an adventurer will also have access to an [[oilskin cloak]], for working around [[water]], and a [[mummy wrapping]] if [[invisibility|invisible]].

Any cloak will block [[rust trap]]s and [[rust monster]]s from harming the armor underneath.  Furthermore, [[destroy armor]] effects, whether from the scroll or the spell, will destroy a cloak before it destroys the suit.  A cloak also gives players wishing to avoid consorting with [[foocubus|foocubi]] an extra chance to say no.  For all of these reasons, any [[BUC|non-cursed]] cloak of not less than +0 enchantment is better than none.

Four cloaks have an appearance that is randomized each game from the following options: tattered cape, ornamental cope, opera cloak, and piece of cloth.

In [[dNetHack]], player [[Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)|vampires]] get a +1 charisma boost for wearing an opera cloak.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Cloaks are the universal outer garb of everyone who is not a
Barbarian.  It is hard to see why.  They are open in front
and require you at most times to use one hand to hold them
shut.  On horseback they leave the shirt-sleeved arms and
most of the torso exposed to wind and Weather.  The OMTs
[ Official Management Terms ] for Cloaks well express their
difficulties.  They are constantly _swirling and dripping_
and becoming _heavy with water_ in rainy Weather, _entangling
with trees_ or _swords_, or needing to be _pulled close
around her/his shivering body_.  This seems to suggest they
are less than practical for anyone on an arduous Tour.

&&%s&& %s Potion of gain level {149762 2023-01-14T10:45:14Z {4001605 NetSysFire} /* Effects */ - blessed potion is same as uncursed potion at xl30 {{potion|name=gain level|cost=300|muse=misc}}

A '''potion of gain level''' is a [[potion]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
2% of all randomly generated potions will be a potion of gain level. The potion may appear in the starting inventory of a [[Wizard]].

Many [[monster]]s can receive this as a [[miscellaneous item]] in their starting inventory.

==Effects==
Quaffing a non-cursed potion of gain level will increase your [[experience level]] by one - an [[uncursed]] potion will set your experience points to the minimum for your new experience level, while a [[blessed]] potion will set your experience points to a random value from the minimum to the maximum for your new experience level - e.g., quaffing an uncursed potion at XL 2 will increase your level to 3 and set your experience points to 40 (the minimum for level 3), while quaffing a blessed potion will set your experience points to a random number from 40 to 79 (80 points is the minimum for level 4). This will also [[auto-identify]] the potion.

Your stats and attributes will increase as normal depending on your level, [[race]], [[role]], and [[constitution]]. If you quaff the non-cursed potion while already at the maximum level (30), it will still increase your HP and energy. A blessed potion behaves exactly as an uncursed potion when increasing those attributes and will not result in more HP and energy.

A [[cursed]] potion does not increase your experience level, but makes you gain one [[pun|''dungeon'' level]] by causing you to rise through the ceiling to the floor above. However, this does not work in any of the following locations: the [[End Game]], [[Sokoban]], the top floors of the [[Wizard's Tower]] and [[Vlad's Tower]], the top floor of the [[Quest]], and [[Fort Ludios]]. A cursed potion of gain level will only work on dungeon level 1 if you are carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]]. Quaffing a cursed potion of gain level does not auto-identify the potion, but will prompt you to name it - doing so while carrying the Amulet is subject to the effects of the [[mysterious force]] in addition to the above.

Intelligent monsters with hands will quaff a potion of gain level in their inventory as soon as the player is within a certain range. A monster quaffing a non-cursed potion will gain experience and possibly [[grow up]] into a more powerful form (e.g. a [[master lich]] into an [[arch-lich]]); if their grown-up form is [[genocide]]d, the monster dies instead. If the potion is cursed, the monster may rise through the ceiling, subject to the same conditions as the player. As usual, witnessing a monster gain experience will auto-identify the potion, and witnessing the cursed potion's effects will prompt you to name it.

==Strategy==
{{main|Experience level#Experience points required per level}}
Blessing potions of gain level before drinking them makes more sense earlier in the game than later. At higher levels - usually around the time you are quest-ready (e.g. XL 14-17) - the number of experience points needed to level up through normal adventuring runs into the hundreds of thousands, such that there is little point in doing so. Potions, [[foocubi]], and [[wraith]] corpses are the preferred methods of gaining levels in that phase.

Cursed potions of gain level are most useful for quickly leaving [[Moloch's Sanctum]] and other non-teleport levels while on the ascent to the [[Elemental Planes]], and can be used as an escape item in a pinch. A player with an otherwise 'complete' ascension kit may consider [[wish]]ing for 2 or 3 cursed potions of gain level as needed.

For [[alchemy]], the potion of gain level has the same uses as a [[potion of gain energy]], but gaining an extra level of experience is generally a better idea unless you have potions to spare. There are also an [[Alchemy#Difficult recipes|couple of]] [[Alchemy#Multiple-step recipes|alchemy recipes]] for producing them.

A constant supply of noncursed potions of gain level is essential for [[pacifist]] players to gain experience levels, though most of those potions will be reserved for their pet of choice (almost always an [[Archon]]).

==History==
The potion of gain level first appears in variants of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], you can [[upgrading objects|upgrade]] objects by dipping them into a potion of gain level - this does not violate polypileless [[conduct]], and doing so will prompt you to name the potion. The potion is also more worthwhile to bless and quaff in SLASH'EM, as the lower XP requirements for gaining levels make killing enough monsters to advance a level feasible for a longer period in comparison to vanilla.

Two potions of gain level can be found in the outside area of [[Grund's Stronghold]].

In [[UnNetHack]], there is a chance of a potion of gain level being found at the bottom of the [[Dragon Caves]] branch.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], [[The Rod of the Elvish Lords]], [[The Rod of Lordly Might]], and [[The Sceptre of Lolth]] all have an [[invoke]] effect that can emulate a cursed potion of gain level if used prior to picking up the Amulet of Yendor.

===NetHack: The Next Generation===
In [[NetHack: The Next Generation]], the [[chemistry set]] can be used to create a potion of gain level, using up four charges.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], the chemistry set is present and functions the same, and the potion of gain level has the same effects as in SLASH'EM.

&&%s&& %s Potion of gain energy {138182 2021-03-02T04:17:14Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Effects */ Link exercise {{potion|name=gain energy|cost=150}}

The '''potion of gain energy''' is a [[potion]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

== Effects ==

A blessed potion will increase maximum energy by 3d6, an uncursed potion will increase maximum energy by 2d6, and a cursed potion will '''decrease''' maximum energy by 1d6. For a non-cursed potion, your current energy is then increased by three times the change, capped at your (new) maximum energy; for a cursed potion, current energy is decreased by three times the change, to a minimum of 0.

All potions of gain energy [[exercise]] [[wisdom]] when quaffed.

==Strategy==
Most spell-casting characters will appreciate having spare potions of gain energy if needed in a pinch; most characters in general will appreciate them more for their [[alchemy]] potential.

===Alchemy===
Mixing a potion of gain energy and a [[potion of healing]], [[potion of extra healing|extra healing]], or [[potion of full healing|full healing]] will "upgrade" them to an uncursed and [[diluted]] potion of extra healing, full healing, or [[potion of gain ability|gain ability]], respectively. If you dip a [[potion of confusion]] into gain energy, you will get a [[potion of enlightenment]] (1/3 chance) or [[potion of booze|booze]] (2/3 chance).

==Messages==
{{message|Magical energies course through your body.|You drank a noncursed potion of gain energy.}}
{{message|You feel lackluster.|You drank a cursed potion of gain energy.}}

==History==
NetHack 3.4.3 used a different formula for this potion. Variants based on that may use the old formula if not explicitly altered.
* A [[blessed]] potion will increase current and maximum energy by from 7 to 11. ("''Magical energies course through your body.''")
* An [[uncursed]] will have the same results with a range of 2 to 6. ("''Magical energies course through your body.''")
* A [[cursed]] potion will decrease your current and maximum power 2 to 6 points. ("''You feel lackluster.''")

==SLASH'EM==
[[SLASH'EM]] changes the potion effects. Your current energy is increased (decreased if cursed) by 9 + 1d25, plus an additional 5 points if the potion is blessed. Your maximum energy is increased (decreased if cursed) by 1d2, plus an additional 2 points if the potion is blessed. If this would put your current energy above your maximum energy, your maximum energy is increased by half the difference between your current energy and your maximum energy, and your current energy is set to this new maximum.

The potion can therefore restore more power than the vanilla equivalent, but for the best permanent increase to maximum power it should be drunk while your power is already at max.

&&%s&& %s Potion of acid {129677 2019-12-14T06:33:12Z {4000978 Aximili} Reorganize {{potion|name=acid|cost=250|muse=off}}
A '''potion of acid''' can be useful as a thrown weapon or to prevent [[stoning|turning to stone]].

== Effects ==

A potion of acid may not be [[diluted]] to [[potion of water|water]]. However, a potion of acid can be [[cancellation|cancelled]] to turn it into a potion of water.

If #[[dip]]ped in water, acid will boil and cause you 1-10 points of damage (except in containers). Walking into water with potions of acid in your inventory can make them explode, even inside a [[sack]] or [[bag of holding]]<ref>or a 1 in 3 chance on a [[cursed]] [[oilskin sack]]</ref>, but they will never dilute or deal damage. The only ways to obtain diluted acid presumably are wishing, or random alchemy results.

Dipping items vulnerable to [[corrosion]] such as [[iron]] erodes the dipped item.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|1984|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

If you [[quaff]] a potion of acid when you are [[stoning|turning to stone]], you will be cured of your stoning. You will abuse your [[constitution]] and take 1d4 points of damage if [[blessed]], 1d8 points of damage if [[uncursed]], and 2d8 points of damage if [[cursed]].

== Messages ==
{{message|This burns a lot!|A monster threw at you, or you quaffed a cursed potion of acid.}}
{{message|This burns like acid!|You quaffed an uncursed potion of acid, and you are not [[acid resistance|acid resistant]].}}
{{message|This tastes sour.|You quaffed any potion of acid, while acid resistant.}}
{{message|This burns!|You quaffed or were hit by a uncursed potion of acid, and you are not acid resistant.}}
{{message|This burns a little!|You quaffed or were hit by a blessed potion of acid, and you are not acid resistant.}}

If the potion was thrown at you or you drank the potion you will be prompted to name it.

== Identification ==

If a monster throws a potion and hits another monster with it, or you throw an unidentified potion at a monster, and the monster "shrieks in pain" or "writhes in pain", the potion is a potion of acid. Holy water can give the same message, but monsters do not use it. You will be prompted to type-name the potion unless it already was named.

Since NetHack 3.6.0, dipping a [[lichen]] corpse into a potion of acid causes it to 'turn red around the edges', or orange if the potion is somehow diluted. This does not consume the potion.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|1949|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

== Strategy ==

Acid is best used either as a [[throw]]n weapon or as an emergency stoning cure. Drinking acid does not break the [[vegan]] or [[vegetarian]] conducts, unlike eating a [[lizard corpse]].

== History ==
[[NetHack 3.4.3]] would semi-reliably crash if you triggered the following bugs. They are fixed in later versions and most [[variant]]s.

* [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-179|C343-179]]: If a monster carrying acid is crushed with a [[drawbridge]], the game may [[panic]]. Same result if you or another monsters [[wand of striking|blows up]] the drawbridge underneath it.
* [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-394|C343-394]]: [[throw|Throwing]] a potion of acid into water ([[pool]]s, [[moat]], [[swamp]]) or at [[iron bars]] will reliably crash the game.

== Variants ==

=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]], potions of acid dissolve [[iron bars]] when they hit them.{{refsrc|src/mthrowu.c|856|unnethack=1499}} To do this, wield a potion of acid and use the [[fight]] (F) command. If done with more than one potion of acid wielded, only one of them is destroyed.

Dipping a [[lichen]] into a potion of acid will identify it.

=== SLASH'EM ===
Valuable gems can be dipped into potion of acid to make new potions. See [[Alchemy#Gem Alchemy (SLASH'EM and dNethack)|Gem Alchemy]].

As the name suggests, the '''potion of blindness''' can cause blindness.

== Effects ==

When [[quaff]]ed, a potion of blindness makes you [[blind]] for a duration dependent on its [[BUC status]], as shown below.

{|class="wikitable"
!Blessed!!Uncursed!!Cursed
|-
|125&ndash;324||250&ndash;449||375&ndash;574
|}

Dipping a [[unicorn horn]] into one of these will produce an uncursed [[potion of water]].

A potion of blindness can be thrown at monsters to blind them.

== Strategy ==

Blindness is generally undesirable, but protects against [[gaze attack]]s and lets you use intrinsic [[telepathy]]. A [[blindfold]] or [[towel]] is preferable, due to togglability and permanence. For advice on how to cope with blindness, see [[zen]].

Once you have a better way to blind yourself, it is best to [[dilution|dilute]] your potions of blindness to make [[potion of water|water]].

== History ==

In [[Bugs_in_NetHack_3.4.3#C343-335|NetHack 3.4.3]], (alternate) [[wield]]ing this potion nullifies the blindness attack of [[Archon]]s and [[yellow light]]s. This was fixed in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

'''Orcrist''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[chaotic]], and its [[base item]] is an [[elven broadsword]]. Orcrist grants a +d5 [[to-hit]] bonus and [[double damage]] against all [[Orc (monster attribute)|orcish]] monsters, and like Sting it [[Warned of monster type|warns of orcs]] when [[wield]]ed, accompanied by the weapon glowing blue.

Orcrist will only [[artifact blast|blast]] you if you are [[polyself|currently]] an orc, and will not do so otherwise regardless of [[alignment]] or [[alignment record]]. Unlike most [[artifact]] weapons, Orcrist does not resist the effects of a cursed [[scroll of enchant weapon]].

==Generation==
Orcrist is a potential [[sacrifice gift]] for chaotic, non-[[Orc (starting race)|orcish]] players.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|156|nethack=3.6.6}}

Orcrist is one of two [[artifact]]s in the game that can be [[name]]d, which is a property shared with Sting: naming any elven broadsword Orcrist will transform it into the artifact, breaking [[illiterate]] [[conduct]].

==Strategy==
Orcrist is generally not of much use for most roles, unless they lack a solid starting weapon ''and'' are able to advance their [[skill]] in [[broadsword]]. Orcs are usually plentiful and also not particularly hard to hit for combat-proficient roles, even before the +5 to-hit bonus is applied. Those who lack experience dealing with groups of orcs may find it a useful supplement, provided they can find an altar or an elven broadsword to name early enough. A role without a reliable weapon such as a [[Tourist]] may consider naming Orcrist to get an early medium-damage weapon that can be reliably trained.

[[Elf (starting race)|Elven]] [[Priest]]s or [[Ranger]]s that desire [[Stormbringer]] can force it by naming both Orcrist and Sting before sacrificing, provided it has not already generated - the first sacrifice gift you are given is always co-aligned. As orcish players cannot receive Orcrist this way, they will instead receive either Stormbringer or [[Grimtooth]] for their first gift.

==History==
Orcrist first appears in [[Hack 1.0]], where it was the sole artifact available until the addition of [[Excalibur]] in [[NetHack 1.3d]]. In Hack 1.0, any weapon could be named Orcrist - this did not transform the weapon, but gave it extra damage against orcs, and could be done with multiple weapons; [[Hack 1.0.2]] restricted the creation of Orcrist this way to [[two-handed sword]]s, though multiple copies were still possible until [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

Orcrist would remain a two-handed sword until [[NetHack 3.1.0]], where it was made an [[elven broadsword]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Orcrist}}
In [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Hobbit'', Orcrist (known in Sindarin as "Goblin-cleaver") was an elven sword originally forged several millennia ago by high-elven smiths in Gondolin alongside Glamdring, the sword of King Turgon - like most elven blades, both swords radiated a blue glow whenever orcs were near. Orcrist has a jeweled hilt and high-quality scabbard, with runes on the sword bearing its name - it is described as killing "hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair Elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls", and was most likely lost during the Fall of Gondolin; it nonetheless became known as the "Biter" among goblins and orcs alike.

Both swords were discovered in a troll-hoard by Thorin's group, with Elrond identifying Orcrist and Thorin promising to honor the sword by killing goblins with it. He would have his chance to do so when he and his company were captured by orcs in the Misty Mountains, who brought them to their kingdom underneath and dragged the group before their ruler, the [[Goblin King|Great Goblin]]. As he accused Thorin's group of spying, one of their captors held out Orcrist to the Great Goblin, and he and his soldiers were enraged at the sight of the "Biter" that had once felled many of their number. As he then approached Thorin, the great fire that lit the large cavern went out - the Great Goblin was quickly slain by the Glamdring-wielding Gandalf, allowing Bilbo and the dwarves to escape.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] changes Orcrist's alignment from chaotic to lawful, since all elves were changed from chaotic to lawful. Additionally, its to-hit bonus is flat like all [[SLASH'EM artifacts|artifact weapons in SLASH'EM]], granting +5 against orcs along with its double damage and a 15% chance to [[cancellation|cancel]] any orc it hits. Orcs as a monster class are more varied and can be much more powerful than in vanilla ''NetHack'', making Orcrist slightly more useful for a longer stretch of the game.

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], Orcrist deals an additional +d4 damage to all foes.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Orcrist also has +1d5 to-hit and double damage against demons, and it warns of them as well, though it is unlikely to be a player's first option for fighting them.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], your god will never give you a nameable artifact such as Orcrist as a sacrifice gift.<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/33e95f977761f66186a1f9aea1ca5e5d262912a2/libnethack/src/artifact.c#L160</ref> This makes forcing Stormbringer much easier for chaotic characters.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], Orcrist is made of [[copper]] like all other elven weapons, and naming an elven broadsword Orcrist will convert it to copper if it is not already made of that material.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Orcrist is made of [[mithril]], which deals an additional +1d8 damage to orcish monsters, including orcish players; naming an elven braodsword Orcrist will convert it to mithril if it is not already made of that material. Additionally, Orcrist has a small chance to instantly kill any orc it hits, making it very dangerous if a player orc encounters a hostile wielding it.

Using a [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forge]] to combine Orcrist and Sting will create the artifact weapon [[EvilHack#Forged Artifacts|Glamdring]], a mithril elven long sword that shares the orc-warning and orc-slaying abilities of its component artifacts.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped.  They knew the sword at once.  It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls.  They had called it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter. They hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.

'''Demonbane''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[lawful]] for wishing purposes, and its [[base item]] type is a [[long sword]].

==Generation==
If Demonbane has not yet been created, an [[Archon]] has a 50% chance of being given Demonbane.{{refsrc|makemon.c|268|comment=the game always tries to give overlord A one of the two artifacts; if the chosen artifact has already been generated, it will be converted to a normal [[rustproof]] long sword. Thus, when one of the two artifacts has already been generated, the next Archon generated has a 50% chance of receiving the other.}}

==Description==
Demonbane has +1d5 [[to-hit]] and deals [[double damage]] against [[major demon]]s - including [[demon lords and princes]], but excluding the [[Riders]],  [[djinn]], the [[mail daemon]], and [[sandestin]]s - and blocks [[demon gating]] while wielded.{{refsrc|artilist.h|105|comment=Demonbane gets a bonus against monster types with the [[M2_DEMON]] flag set}}{{reffunc|monst.c|Imps and other minor demons|comment=No minor demon has [[M2_DEMON]] set}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Wielding Demonbane now prevents you from [[Bribe#Bribing in Gehennom|bribing]] demons as [[Excalibur]] does.

As of {{commit|b1a5a9c3903a0282f82787d20fd70f13196e2465|commit b1a5a9c}}, Demonbane's base item is now a [[mace]], it is the guaranteed first [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Priest]]s, and it can be [[invoke]]d to banish major demons to [[Gehennom]]. The former two traits are adapted from [[SporkHack]]. This means that [[angelic being]]s will not ever receive Demonbane (since they receive long swords).}}

==Strategy==
Demonbane is slightly less useless than most of the other monster-specific weapons, since demons are actually reasonably common in the late game and could use an extra dose of damage. However, there are plenty of other weapons that do extra damage to demons, such as [[Grayswandir]], [[Frost Brand]], or even a regular [[silver saber]], on which your scrolls of enchant weapon are certainly better spent. Therefore, Demonbane is rarely used.

If you have no other particularly good artifacts, it may make a good weapon for an intelligent pet, especially since [[Archons]] are often generated with it.

==History==
Demonbane's ability to block demon gating was first added in [[SporkHack]], and much later added to [[3.6.1]].

== Variants ==

=== dNetHack ===
In dNetHack, Demonbane is a lawful silver saber that blocks demons' passive summoning abilities, even when wielded in the offhand. Its double damage and warning are preserved.

=== FIQHack ===
In FIQHack, Demonbane is a silver saber. Its damage bonus is changed from double damage to +1d20. It still prevents demon gating.

=== UnNetHack ===

In UnNetHack, Demonbane grants [[Warned of monster type|warning versus demons]].
