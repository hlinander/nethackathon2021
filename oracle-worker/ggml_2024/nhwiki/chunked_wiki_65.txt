==The mid game==
The mid game involves the remainder of the Dungeons of Doom, including the Quest and Castle. You will get a wand of wishing during this portion of the game, so you will be able to flesh out your equipment.

===Goals===
* Reach [[experience level]] 14. This is required to enter the [[quest]], but can take some time. Leveling to 13 and 14 by killing monsters is a painful and slow process. Hopefully, you will find some [[wraith]]s or [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]] â€” or make these potions via [[alchemy]]. If not, you may end up clearing the [[Castle]] and the [[Valley of the Dead]] before you are able to enter your quest.
* Kill [[Medusa]]. You can dig past her [[Medusa's Island|island]], but you will eventually have to come up back past her. [[Perseus]]'s statue can contain [[levitation boots]] or a [[shield of reflection]], and the boots in particular can help with the Castle. You will generally need to have [[reflection]] or be [[blind]] to face Medusa's stoning gaze.
* Do the [[Quest]]. Some quests (such as the [[Wizard quest]]) are generally considered to be easy, others (such as the [[Monk quest]]) are considered extremely difficult. Either way, you will have to do it at some point: the [[quest artifact]] is almost always very useful, and you will need to retrieve the [[Bell of Opening]] from your [[Quest nemesis#Quest leaders and nemeses|nemesis]] to complete the game.
* Conquer the [[Castle]]. You will need some way of getting in. Any source of [[levitation]], a [[tonal instrument|tonal musical instrument]], or [[wand of striking|some]] [[force bolt|way]] to smash the [[drawbridge]] plus [[jumping]] or diving into the water will do the trick. A musical instrument has the advantage of allowing you to [[Drawbridge#Strategy|grind just about every inhabitant of the Castle to mush]] without any risk to yourself, but you will want levitation or jumping to reach the weapon and armor storerooms. The Castle can be very risky if you have not [[genocide]]d [[lich]]es and do not have [[magic resistance]]. It is not uncommon for the Castle to contain one or more teleporting, [[monster spell|nasty summoning, armor destroying, equipment cursing, touch of death]] using arch-liches, so be careful! There is a [[wand of wishing]] in one of the corner towers, which should fill most remaining gaps in your equipment.
{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Master- and arch-liches will no longer generate at the Castle (or outside of Gehennom) when class L are specified by [[monster creation#Selection by monster class|class-based monster creation]].}}

==The late game==
You should have most (if not all) resistances, good stats, and excellent equipment by this point. [[Wand]]s are twice as likely to be generated in Gehennom as in the rest of the dungeon, so you may find many wands useful for the end game.

===Goals===
* Go through [[Gehennom]]. This portion of the game is composed almost entirely of mazes, which can be frustrating and boring to map. There are [[Gehennom mapping|some ways to ease the pain]]. Particularly on maze levels, [[Digging]] a path between the upstairs and downstairs (and perhaps also into other regions) when possible can help reducing [[mysterious force]] induced headaches and [[Rodney]] visitations during the ascension run. 
* Be careful of the [[Demon prince#Unique demons and summoning|Powerful demons]] who make their homes in Gehennom. Though most heroes have sufficient firepower, by the time they get there, to tear through the hellish overlords, if you get yourself into a pickle, your god will be unable to help you while you are in the fiery depths. Be prepared to face [[Juiblex]], [[Orcus]], [[Baalzebub]] and [[Asmodeus]], and possibly [[Demogorgon]] if you are unlucky.
* Kill [[Vlad the Impaler]]. The upstairs to [[Vlad's Tower|his tower]] is located between the 9th and 13th level of Gehennom. Once you do find it, the tower has a couple of nice goodies, notably an [[amulet of life saving]]. Vlad might be very easy or harder than major demons, depending on the weapon he is generated with. He carries the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]], which is required for the invocation ritual.
* Find the [[vibrating square]]. The vibrating square is located at the very bottom of Gehennom, on a level with no downstairs. It is not found by means such as [[magic mapping]] and requires wandering to find. Since this can take some time to find, you would rather do it before drawing the ire of the [[Wizard of Yendor]]. In version 3.6.1, it is marked by (~) once it is found. In versions 3.4.3 and earlier, it was not marked even after it was found, thus it was recommended that you mark it in some way so that you did not have to go through the hassle of remembering or finding it again.

==The end game==
The first step in the end game is killing the Wizard of Yendor. He is the single most persistent and irksome enemy in the game, so before slaying him, you should have everything arranged. Remap any levels lost to [[amnesia]] not recorded (hopefully none), pack the wands, scrolls, potions, rings, and tools for your ascension run, and take a deep breath.
{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Levels can no longer be forgotten.}}

===Goals===
* Kill the [[Wizard of Yendor]]. The portal to [[Wizard's Tower|his tower]] is located in one of two fake towers. His tower is fairly straightforward, but the man himself is a pest. He can curse your inventory items, summon nasties or a [[Double trouble|clone of himself]], and use touch of death. He can also [[theft (attack)|steal]] quest artifacts, the invocation items, and the Amulet of Yendor. Once you kill him, he will not leave you alone until the end of the game; if he does not simply reincarnate to face you again, he may throw any number of maledictions in your direction. However, you need the [[Book of the Dead]] he carries to...
* ...perform the [[Invocation ritual|invocation]] and retrieve the [[amulet of yendor|Amulet]]. Once you have killed the Wizard, you should have all three invocation items, allowing you access to the [[Moloch's Sanctum|Sanctum]]. Once you hack your way through the undead and priests standing in your way, you will face the High Priest of Moloch. Kill him to retrieve the Amulet. From here you can return to dungeon level one and take the upstairs to begin the final test.
* Pass through the [[Elemental Planes]]. The Wizard can reappear at any point up to the Astral Plane, so do not let your guard down. [[Levitation]] is very useful here, as is a way of detecting the portals (confused or cursed [[scroll of gold detection]] is popular). [[Conflict]] can also help to keep the masses of super-elementals off your back, especially on the [[Plane of Air]], where the air elementals can chew through your health in an incredibly short time.
* Welcome to the [[Astral Plane]]! There are many [[Astral plane#Strategy|creative strategies]] for dealing with the hordes of angry priests and angels, as well as the formidable [[Riders]]. Good luck and Godspeed.
* Sacrifice the [[Amulet of Yendor]] on the Astral plane to end the game. Some players can be tricked by a [[fake Amulet of Yendor]] from a cloned Wizard of Yendor or a [[player monster]], so be sure yours is not a fake. If you want to ascend to demigod(ess)hood, make sure you sacrifice on the altar of your own alignment.
