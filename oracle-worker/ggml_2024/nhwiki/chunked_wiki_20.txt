Note that an armor class of 0 is often insufficient to safely melee some monsters with a difficulty of 6, like jaguars, unicorns, and soldier ants.  An armor class of -10 can make most of the early/mid game monsters safe to melee.
The above table does not include all of the monsters that are dangerous to melee in the early game.  In particular, [[Dwarf_(monster)|dwarves]] wielding [[Dwarvish mattock|mattocks]], [[mimics]], and [[mumak]]s can deal considerable damage on each of their turns.  These monsters are slower than a typical player, however, and mean damage per ''player turn'' could be misleading.

==Best realistically possible armor class==

There is no limit to how much [[intrinsic protection]] you can have, but donating to [[aligned priest|priest]]s will rarely grant more than nine points.  Further protection can be granted by [[ring of protection|rings of protection]] or [[prayer]], or temporarily by the [[Spellbook of protection|protection spell]].  Many [[polymorph]]ed forms have base armor class better than 10.  Assuming nine points protection, seven piece armor with each piece the best possible for its type, and each piece enchanted to +5 (elven pieces to +7), one's armor class would be:

{|class="wikitable"
!Armor piece!!Protection!!With enchantment
|-
|Any [[dragon scale mail]]||9||14
|-
|[[Cloak of protection]]||3||8
|-
|[[Elven leather helm]]||1||8
|-
|[[Elven shield]]||2||9
|-
|[[Elven boots]]||1||8
|-
|[[Gloves]], any type||1||6
|-
|[[Hawaiian shirt]] or [[T-shirt]]||0||5
|}

totaling 9 + (14 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 6 + 5) = 67 points, for an armor class of -57. However, it would be rare for a player to [[Ascension kit#Armor_combinations|use]] this equipment: many characters would rather [[twoweapon]] than wear a shield; some players prefer a [[shield of reflection]]; [[jumping boots]] or [[speed boots]] are usually preferable to elven boots if available; a [[helm of brilliance]] is usually better than an elven leather helm; and a [[cloak of magic resistance]], [[cloak of displacement]], or [[robe]] may be more useful than a cloak of protection. An armor class of -57 is also overkill for any ordinary game, so most players would rather use their [[magic marker]] charges on something more useful than excessive [[scroll of enchant armor|scrolls of enchant armor]].

==SLASH'EM==
Dexterity has an impact on AC.

Doppelgangers and Monks have complicated special bonuses. Doppelgangers get the bonus for not wearing any armor, and Monks get the bonus for no shield, no wielded weapon, and no body armor (cloaks and robes are allowed).

[[Category:Items]]. [[Artifact]]s are rare and unique objects.

[[Category:Items]]}
&&%s&& %s Guidebook {138329 2021-03-06T22:59:31Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Conducts */ It's a justification - not an example, unless we have different definitions of "example" The '''NetHack Guidebook''', formally '''A Guide to the Mazes of Menace: Guidebook for NetHack''', documents the basic gameplay and [[options]] of the ''[[NetHack]]'' game. This is the most important documentation included in ''NetHack'' itself. Though NetHack also includes help files to describe the map symbols, keyboard controls and options, the Guidebook introduces those things in more detail.

For most players, the Guidebook, or rather a certain portion of it, is a very important read. The Guidebook introduces the various [[item]] types, like armor and scrolls. The Guidebook is also the place to learn about [[Elbereth]].

Note that "[[Mazes of Menace]]" refers to the entire [[dungeon]], and is no synonym for "[[Dungeons of Doom]]" or "[[Gehennom]]". "[[Dungeons of Doom]]" refers to the [[dungeon branch]] where you start the game; "Gehennom" is the dungeon branch that contains the [[Amulet of Yendor]].

== Access ==
If [[you]] have NetHack on your computer, then the installation should include a copy of the Guidebook; you can also visit the official website and view an online copy.

When building and installing NetHack from [[source code]], the [[makefile]]s typically do not install the Guidebook. Thus, you may find a NetHack installation with no Guidebook. You might also be unaware if your [[Unix]] clone distro stashed the Guidebook in <tt>/usr/local/share/doc/nethack/Guidebook.txt</tt> or some such place.

== History of the Guidebook ==
[[Eric S. Raymond]] was the original author of the Guidebook. [[NetHack 2.2a]] seems to be the first version to include the Guidebook; the [[DevTeam]] extensively edited and updated the Guidebook for later versions. For previous versions, players had to rely on the in-game [[help (in-game)|help]], which existed since the very first versions of ''[[Hack]]'' in the form of a 'long' help and a 'short' help; the long help introduces NetHack as a "[[Dungeons and Dragons]] like game", describes the map symbols and introduces the keyboard controls, while the short help only reviews the controls. Unlike the Guidebook, the in-game help does not describe the game's roles and races, nor does it detail the basic purpose of each type of item.

The Guidebook does acknowledge a predecessor document, ''A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom'', the guide for [[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]. Rogue's guide is the 30th paper of the ''UNIX User's Supplementary Documents'' on some [[BSD]] systems.

== Chapters ==
The Guidebook consists of twelve chapters. The 3.6.0 Guidebook also contains a preface, dedicating this version of the game to author Terry Pratchett.

=== Introduction ===
The first chapter, "Introduction", sets the mood of the game. Many players only remember the in-game [[introduction]], which proclaims your destiny "heralded from birth" to obtain the Amulet of Yendor for your god. The Guidebook provides a different and lengthier introduction.

Dreams of dungeon exploration enter your sleep, and bring your desire to become an adventurer. ''"Eventually you can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer."'' Then you hear rumours of the lost Amulet of Yendor, that will bring wealth to the one who finds it. ''"Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is some profound and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke."'' You journey for days until you reach the Mazes of Menace, and sleep at the entrance. ''"In the morning, you gather your gear, eat what may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon..."''

The [[Vulture's]] interface adapts the Guidebook's introduction into an illustrated in-game sequence, with its own background [[music]]. This sequence automatically plays after you select a new character in Vulture's.

=== What is going on here? ===
The Guidebook uses its second chapter, "What is going on here?", to enumerate the [[role]]s and [[race]]s of NetHack. These are the first of the long lists within the Guidebook. The descriptions only set the mood and provide a few hints, but remain so useful to a new NetHack player. Before the Guidebook, the in-game [[help (in-game)|help]] did not mention roles.

* ''Roles'': [[Archeologist]], [[Barbarian]], [[Caveman]] and [[Cavewoman]], [[Healer]], [[Knight]], [[Monk]], [[Priest]] and [[Priestess]], [[Ranger]], [[Rogue]], [[Samurai]], [[Tourist]], [[Valkyrie]], [[Wizard]].
* ''Races'': [[Dwarf]], [[Elf (starting race)|Elf]], [[Gnome (starting race)|Gnome]], [[Human (starting race)|Human]], [[Orc (starting race)|Orc]].

=== What do all these things on the screen mean? ===
The third chapter explains the screen. First, it contrasts NetHack (and other [[roguelike]] games) with [[text adventure]] games. ''"Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen."'' It soon becomes apparent that the Guidebook uses the word "graphically" to refer to either [[ASCII]] graphics or [[tiles]].

Section 3.1 describes the [[status line]]. Unlike the in-game [[help (in-game)|help]] that only provides a one-paragraph summary of the status line, the Guidebook introduces each element of the status line.

* ''Parts of the status line:'' [[Rank]], [[Strength]], [[Dexterity]], [[Constitution]], [[Intelligence]], [[Wisdom]], [[Charisma]], [[Alignment]], [[Dungeon level|Dungeon Level]], [[Gold]], [[Hit points|Hit Points]], [[Power]], [[Armor Class]], [[Experience]], [[Time]], and [[Hunger]] status.

Section 3.1 introduces strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma as the "six basic [[attribute]]s" of your character. (Thus [[we]] often say "attribute", not "ability" or "stat".) It is possible to read this section and not understand the importance of raising these six attributes to high values. The Guidebook does not mention [[exercise]] or any other way to increase these attributes, except to say that "magic can also cause attributes to exceed the normal limits".

Players of other games may want to read the Guidebook to learn that "[[power]]" is a synonym for "spell points" or "mana", and may want to give their attention to the description of [[AC]]: ''"The lower this number is, the more effective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative armor class."''

Section 3.2 mentions the [[message]] line; section 3.3 enumerates the various [[ASCII]] characters that you may find on the map, and gives a sentence description of each.

* ''ASCII characters:'' [[-]] and [[pipe||]], [[dot|.]], [[hash mark|#]], [[angle bracket|>]] and [[angle bracket|<]], [[plus sign|+]], [[@]], [[$]], [[^]], [[)]], [[square bracket|[]], [[%]], [[?]], [[slash|/]], [[=]], [[!]], [[(]], [["]], [[*]], [[`]], [[0]], [[underscore|_]], [[left curly bracket|{]], [[right curly bracket|}]], [[\]], [[I]].

=== Commands ===
The fourth chapter enumerates the commands of the game. This can overwhelm the new player. The chapter provides most commands in alphabetical order, and does not group related commands, except to place [[help (in-game)|help]] commands and movement commands at the start of the list.

A new player might want to skim or skip the alphabetical part of the list, and go forward to later chapters of Guidebook, which suggest commands for specific situations. For example, section 5.1 which discusses doors, also explains how to use the door commands ([[c]], [[o]], [[^D]] and sometimes [[a]]). Note that organizing commands into groups can mislead; if you think that [[q]] is the [[potion]] command, then you might never try to quaff from a [[fountain]].

* ''Commands'': [[?]], [[slash|/]], [[&]], [[angle bracket|<]], [[angle bracket|>]], [[yuhjklbn]], [[m]], [[F]], [[M]], [[g]], [[G]], [[underscore|_]], [[dot|.]], [[a]], [[A]], [[^A]], [[c]], [[C]], [[^C]], [[d]], [[D]], [[^D]], [[e]], [[E]], [[f]], [[i]], [[I]], [[o]], [[O]], [[p]], [[P]], [[^P]], [[q]], [[Q]], [[r]], [[R]], [[^R]], [[s]], [[S]], [[t]], [[T]], [[^T]], [[v]], [[V]], [[w]], [[W]], [[x]], [[X]], [[^X]], [[z]], [[Z]], [[^Z]], [[colon|:]], [[;]], [[pick up|,]], [[autopickup|@]], [[trap id|^]], [[)]], [[left square bracket|[]], [[=]], [["]], [[(]], [[*]], [[$]], [[+]], [[\]], [[shell escape|!]], [[hash mark|#]], #[[adjust]], #[[annotate]], #[[chat]], #[[conduct]], #[[dip]], #[[enhance]], #[[force]], #[[invoke]], #[[jump]], #[[loot]], #[[monster (command)|monster]], #[[name]], #[[offer]], #[[overview]], #[[pray]], #[[quit]], #[[ride]], #[[rub]], #[[sit]], #[[terrain]], #[[tip]], #[[turn]], #[[twoweapon]], #[[untrap]], #[[version]], #[[wipe]], #[[?]], and in [[number_pad]] mode, [[h]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[N]], [[u]].

There is something important in the description of the "E" command: ''"Engraving the word '[[Elbereth]]' will cause most monsters to not attack you hand-to-hand (but if you attack, you will rub it out); this is often useful to give yourself a breather. (This feature may be compiled out of the game, so your version might not have it.)"''

Unfortunately, the Guidebook's description for some commands remains less verbose than it should be. For example, the description for #turn says only, "[[Turn undead]]." It should explain that #turn would scare undead monsters, so that players do not try to use the command to become an undead creature.

To avoid [[spoiler]]s, the Guidebook does not explain how to #jump, what to #invoke or where to #sit.

=== Rooms and Corridors ===
The fifth chapter, "Rooms and Corridors", introduces a few of the basic [[dungeon feature]]s. Section 3.3 already gave the characters for each feature, but did not provide detail.

* ''Dungeon features:'' [[room]], [[corridor]], [[doorway]] and [[door]], [[trap]], [[stair]], [[ladder]], [[shop]].

This chapter is not a [[spoiler]]. It does not mention other features such as [[fountain]]s and [[throne]]s. The Guidebook only provides in section 3.3 that { is fountain and \ is throne. It never explains that one may quaff from fountains or sit on thrones.

However the chapter does include a few hints. It makes explicit that one may not travel diagonally through an open door (though many players would soon observe so), discloses the existence of both the [[Gnomish Mines]] and [[Sokoban]], and provies a hint about stairs. ''"However, pets (see below) and some other monsters will follow along if they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs, and occasionally one of these creatures will displace you during the climb. When that occurs, the pet or other monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby."'' So if you do not arrive at a staircase, then the staircase must be nearby.

: (Actually, that is not always true. If you take the up staircase from the level below the [[Castle]], then you will arrive at the Castle's level, which does not have a down staircase.)

==== Shops and shopping ====
Importantly, the fifth chapter explains shops. An encounter with shop in ''Hack'' or ''NetHack'' was much less intuitive before the Guidebook added section 5.5 about how to use shops. A clever player might combine two of the hints in "Shop idiosyncracies" to create a [[shoplifting]] strategy.

The Guidebook never mentions that [[Pet#Speed|pet displacement]] never works in shops; but the Guidebook never mentions pet displacement.

=== Monsters ===
The sixth chapter opens with another hint, that one may want to #chat with the Oracle of Delphi. It also discusses how to [[melee]] monsters, and provides sections about [[pet]]s, [[steed]]s, and [[ghost]]s from [[bones level]]s.

Examples of what one can learn:
* Adjacent pets follow you through staircases and pets.
* You can train pets by throwing food (but the Guidebook does not explain that the food must be a [[treat]], nor does it explain that trained pets bring objects closer to you).
* When you [[ride]] a steed, the steed appears on the map.
* ''"Ghosts are hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow and do little damage."''

=== Objects ===
The seventh chapter is one of the most useful in the Guidebook, especially for those players who never played other "[[Dungeons and Dragons]] like games".

Examples of what one can learn:
* Given to the #[[name]] command, a single space removes the name from an object.
* After you read a [[scroll]], it disappears.
* The game has a "[[scroll of identify]]".
* An identified [[wand]] shows the number of times recharged, then the number of charges.
* [[Ring]]s and [[amulet]]s provide magic when worn.
* Several commands interact with [[container]]s.

Players who became stuck to [[cursed]] item might want to read section 7.1, about curses and blessings.

==== Weapons ====
Section 7.2 on [[weapon]]s refers players to the game of AD&D ("Advanced [[Dungeons and Dragons]]"): ''"Those of you in the audience who are AD&D players, be aware that each weapon which existed in AD&D does roughly the same damage to monsters in NetHack. Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the ''aklys'', ''lucern hammer'', and ''bec-de-corbin'') are defined in an appendix to ''Unearthed Arcana'', an AD&D supplement."'' The relevant AD&D specifications have now entered ''The d20 System Reference Document'' (d20 SRD), which is freely available in many places, for example as [http://www.d20srd.org/index.htm ''The Hypertext d20 SRD'']. The d20 system is based on edition 3.5 of Dungeons and Dragons.

Only editions 1 and 2 bore the adjective ''Advanced'', and it is presumably one of these editions the Guidebook refers to. Substantial changes have been made to (Advanced) Dungeons and Dragons since then, so any comparison of weapon tables in NetHack and the d20 system is meaningless.

{{todo|someone with access to a reliable source for the weapon tables in AD&D editions 1 and 2 may like to provide a table of meaningful comparisons here}}

Section 7.2 also contains subsections relating to [[throw|throwing]] and [[projectile|shooting]], [[Skill|weapon proficiency]], and [[Twoweapon|two-weapon combat]].

==== Armor ====
Section 7.3 on [[armor]] also refers to AD&D, but the Guidebook lists AC values of most types of body armor, so that players need not consult the AD&D definitions. (Indeed, the modern d20 system now does AC differently from NetHack, so the [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/armor.htm#tableArmorandShields AC values in d20] do not match the AC values in NetHack. NetHack AC counts down from 10; d20 AC counts ''up'' from 10. Ignoring other bonuses, the [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#armorClass d20 formula for AC] is 10 plus the armor bonus. So a scale mail provides AC 6 in NetHack but AC 14 in d20.)

The authority on weapons and armor in NetHack is not the AD&D spec, but the NetHack [[source code]] or a [[spoiler]] such as this [[wiki]].

* ''Armor in order of AC:'' [[dragon scale mail]], [[plate mail]], [[crystal plate mail]], [[bronze plate mail]], [[splint mail]], [[banded mail]], [[dwarvish mithril-coat]], [[elven mithril-coat]], [[chain mail]], [[orcish chain mail]], [[scale mail]], [[studded leather armor]], [[ring mail]], [[orcish ring mail]], [[leather armor]], [[leather jacket]], and no armor.

=== Conducts ===
The eighth chapter of the Guidebook documents [[conduct]]s.

Even for a player who never [[ascension|ascended]] and who does not intend to follow any conducts, this chapter contains a few subtle hints. ''"Calling upon your god for help with starvation does not violate any food challenges either."'' So, gods can help with starvation. You might recall from the chapter 4 that the #[[pray]] command does ''"Pray to the gods for help."'' You might correctly conclude that prayer may help with starvation.

This section also documents which food qualifies as [[vegan]] or [[vegetarian]]; this might also help unspoiled players who need food for their vegetarian pet (sections 6.2 and 7.4). It also notes that [[Potion of water|liquids]] [[Potion of fruit juice|that]] [[Potion of booze|provide nutrition]] do not count against foodless conduct, citing "a physiological need for water" as a justification.

=== Options ===
The ninth chapter of the Guidebook is a comprehensive description of all of the game options, and how to set them. Section 9.4 enumerates the customization options in alphabetical order, and does not attempt to group the options into categories (such as options for character generation).

This wiki provides more information about some options, but perhaps the Guidebook is the better source of information for many of them. Most of the below links redirect to a section on our [[option]] page, but some (like [[Autopickup]]) have their own page.

* ''Options:'' [[acoustics]], [[align]], [[autodig]], [[autoopen]], [[autopickup]], [[autoquiver]], [[options#blind|blind]], [[options#bones|bones]], [[catname]], [[options#character|character]], [[checkpoint]], [[checkspace]], [[clicklook]], [[cmdassist]], [[confirm]], [[dark_room]], [[disclose]], [[dogname]], [[extmenu]], [[options#female|female]], [[fixinv]], [[options#fruit|fruit]], [[options#gender|gender]], [[options#help|help]], [[hilite_pet]], [[hilite_pile]], [[horsename]], [[ignitr]], [[implicit_uncursed]], [[legacy]], [[lit_corridor]], [[lootabc]], [[mail]], [[male]], [[mention_walls]], [[menucolors]], [[menustyle]], [[menu_deselect_all]], [[menu_deselect_page]], [[menu_first_page]], [[menu_headings]], [[menu_invert_all]], [[menu_invert_page]], [[menu_last_page]], [[menu_next_page]], [[menu_objsyms]], [[menu_previous_page]], [[menu_search]], [[menu_select_all]], [[menu_select_page]], [[msghistory]], [[msg_window]], [[name]], [[news]], [[nudist]], [[null]], [[number_pad]], [[packorder]], [[paranoid_confirmation]], [[perm_invent]], [[pettype]], [[pickup_burden]], [[pickup_thrown]], [[pickup_types]], [[pile_limit]], [[playmode]], [[pushweapon]], [[options#race|race]], [[rest_on_space]], [[options#role|role]], [[roguesymset]], [[rlecomp]], [[runmode]], [[safe_pet]], [[scores]], [[showexp]], [[showrace]], [[showscore]], [[silent]], [[sortloot]], [[sortpack]], [[sparkle]], [[standout]], [[statushilites]], [[suppress_alert]], [[symset]], [[time]], [[timed_delay]], [[tombstone]], [[toptenwin]], [[travel]], [[verbose]], [[windowtype]], and on some windowing systems, [[align_message]], [[align_status]], [[ascii_map]], [[color]], [[eight_bit_tty]], [[font_map]], [[font_menu]], [[font_message]], [[font_status]], [[font_text]], [[font_size_map]], [[font_size_menu]], [[font_size_message]], [[font_size_status]], [[font_size_text]], [[fullscreen]], [[large_font]], [[map_mode]], [[mouse_support]], [[player_selection]], [[popup_dialog]], [[preload_tiles]], [[scroll_amount]], [[scroll_margin]], [[selectsaved]], [[softkeyboard]], [[splash_screen]], [[tiled_map]], [[tile_file]], [[tile_height]], [[tile_width]], [[use_darkgray]], [[use_inverse]], [[vary_msgcount]], [[windowcolors]], [[wraptext]], and on some operating systems, [[altkeyhandler]], [[altmeta]], [[BIOS]], [[flush]], [[MACgraphics]], [[page_wait]], [[rawio]], [[soundcard]], [[subkeyvalue]], [[video]], [[videocolors]], [[videoshades]].

Sections 9.7 through 9.15 detail further configuration capabilities in Nethack, many of which are new to version 3.6.0. Detailed explanations are provided for regular expressions, [[autopickup exceptions]], [[MSGTYPE|message types]], [[menucolors]], [[user sounds]], [[statushilites]], modifying the [[Symset|symbols NetHack uses]] in its display, configuring NetHack for play by the blind, and notes for system administrators.

=== Scoring ===
The tenth chapter of the Guidebook suggests what would lead you to a [[higher score]]. ''"Your score is chiefly based upon how much experience you gained, how much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and how the game ended."'' This chapter argues that you might want to intentionally [[quit]] instead of dying, because death causes a 10% penalty to your score.

The quitting to preserve one's score seems not to be a common practice. In nearly all cases, players will try to survive (by [[Elbereth]], by the mercy of [[Random Number God]], or by some other [[strategy]]) instead of quitting.

The eleventh chapter of the Guidebook documents [[explore mode]]. Also mentioned is debug mode, known as [[wizard mode]], but it is stressed that this is for debugging rather than to give the player god-like powers within the game.

=== Credits ===
The twelfth and final chapter of the Guidebook contains one paragraph of credits for the Guidebook itself, followed by the [[game history]] text (which is the same as the text from the in-game help). The game history is a long list of contributors to ''NetHack'', including the original ''[[Hack]]'' developers and the persons who did various [[port]]s.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
''[[SLASH'EM]]'' players may access the Guidebook during the game, by pressing [?] and selecting "The SLASH'EM Guidebook." This displays the Guidebook in the [[pager]] of your [[user interface]]. You may find that this is too inconvenient, especially if you are using the [[tty]] interface and cannot scroll upward. You may prefer to use an external page to load the Guidebook.txt file in the [[playground]] directory.

SLASH'EM modifies the Guidebook to introduce the new role and race selections and explain the new configurable options and multiple [[tileset]]s.

A '''corpse''', also referred to as a '''cadaver''', is the body of a dead [[monster]]. It is a very common [[comestible]]. Some monsters never drop corpses, some monsters drop corpses occasionally, while others will always drop corpses except in special circumstances.

Even though all corpses are classified as comestibles, that does not imply that they should all be eaten. Some corpses are [[acid]]ic, [[poison]]ous or [[hallucination|hallucinogenic]]; some corpses will give you a property that you may not want; even worse, some corpses are deadly to eat. Normally, you should avoid those corpses unless you have the appropriate resistance or means of curing the condition that they cause. One way to learn which corpses to avoid is to watch which ones your pet eats; for example, a pet will never eat a poisonous corpse (unless the pet is poison resistant). However, there are exceptions to this rule; for example, domestic pets may eat corpses of cats, dogs, bats, violet fungi, leprechauns, nymphs, stalkers, tengu, and your race without adverse effects, and you do not want to eat those corpses unless you have a way of dealing with their negative effects.

Most corpses can be [[revive]]d with a [[wand of undead turning]] or [[spell of turn undead]], and a few revive spontaneously.

==Corpse generation odds==
Most monsters do not always leave a corpse when they die. Monsters that normally would leave a corpse will not if killed by [[stoning]], [[disintegration]], or [[digestion]]. [[Corpseless]] monsters such as [[ghost]]s or [[yellow light]]s will never leave a corpse. [[Lizard]]s and any monster that is larger than [[size]] Medium are guaranteed to leave a corpse when killed by normal means unless they were produced by cloning, and [[player monster]]s and the [[Riders]] will always leave a corpse; in particular, this means that [[troll]]s, whose corpses can be very annoying, will normally always leave a corpse. [[Golem]]s are guaranteed to leave their special death drops (if applicable) when killed.
As of [[3.6.1]], [[shopkeeper]]s also always leave a corpse.{{refsrc|mon.c|2020|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

For all other monsters, there is a 1 in ''n'' chance that the monster will leave a corpse when killed, where ''n'' is generated as follows:{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1923|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
*''n'' starts with a value of 2
*Add 1 if the monster is size Tiny
*Add 1 if the monster's generation frequency is "Very Rare", "Not randomly generated" or "Unique".

Monsters will never leave a corpse on the [[Rogue level]]. Undead on a [[Special room#Graveyard|graveyard]] level have 1/9 of the normal chance of leaving a corpse if killed by you, or 1/3 of the normal chance if killed by anything else, further reducing the above odds.

(In a similar vein, some monster types will get replaced when you bring them back to life, e. g. priest corpses become zombies.)

As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], monsters represented by {{mcsl|P}} ([[gray ooze]], [[brown pudding|brown]] and [[black pudding]], [[green slime]]) leave [[glob]]s instead of corpses. Globs can be eaten like corpses, but not sacrificed or [[revive]]d. (This was changed due to [[pudding farming]].)
In earlier versions of NetHack, and variants based on earlier versions, these monsters leave corpses.

==Special corpse behavior==

* [[Lizard]] and acidic corpses cure stoning.
* Lizard and [[lichen]] corpses never rot away, and never cause [[food poisoning]]. (They do, however, get too old to [[sacrifice]].)
* [[Troll]] corpses (all {{white|T}}) come back to life 75% of the time.
* The [[Riders|Riders']] corpses have a chance of coming back to life starting 12 turns after their "death".
* Acid blob corpses never cause [[food poisoning]], they are safe (but damaging) to eat and are suitable for [[sacrifice]] until they rot away.

==Aging==
Corpses are generally most useful and safe when fresh, slowly [[rotten|rotting]] as the [[turn]]s pass. In most cases, with increasing age corpses become unsuitable for sacrifice or for feeding your pet, and also become harmful or even deadly for you to eat, until finally they rot away to nothing.

Corpses do not age while stored in an [[ice box]], and age at only half the normal rate while lying on [[ice]]. A [[tinning kit]] is also handy for preserving corpses for later consumption, by converting them into [[tin]]s.

Any corpse dug up from a [[grave]] will already be old, aged 100 turns.{{refsrc|src/dig.c|918|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} All [[mummy|mummies]], [[zombie]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[ghoul]]s are [[undead]]&mdash;walking corpses already&mdash;so any corpse they leave will be the same age.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|307|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

Your [[god]] regards a corpse as "fresh" up to a maximum age of 50 and will accept its sacrifice on an [[altar]].{{refsrc|src/pray.c|1301|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} If the corpse is too old, "Nothing happens." Even lizard and lichen corpses are subject to this limit, but acid blob corpses are an exception, suitable for sacrifice at any age.

[[Pet]]s regard a corpse as "old" once its age reaches 50 turns.{{refsrc|src/dog.c|792|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/dog.c|770|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} Most pets will refuse to eat old corpses, except for lizard and lichen corpses; however, [[ghoul]]s eat old corpses exclusively.

When you yourself eat a corpse, the effect of age is more complex, as the corpse progresses through several degrees of rottenness:
* Lizard and lichen corpses are always safe for your consumption.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|51|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1552|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
* For other corpses, rottenness is determined as age divided by random integer from 10 to 29, with a +2 bonus for being cursed or &minus;2 for being blessed.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1542|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
* If the rottenness is 6 or more, the corpse is considered "tainted" and will give you fatal [[food poisoning]], causing you to die in 10&ndash;19 turns. The corpse then rots completely, without any further effects (no nutrition or intrinsics conferred, no damage from poisonous corpses, etc.){{refsrc|src/eat.c|1552|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
** [[Acid blob]]s are never tainted.
** [[Cockatrice]], chickatrice, and [[Medusa]] corpses [[Stoning|turn you to stone]] regardless of age. If you are petrification resistant, the corpses can be tainted and poison you as normal.
** If you eat a tainted corpse while being [[Immunity to sickness|immune to sickness]], you will not become sick, but the corpse still rots completely, conferring no nutrition, intrinsics, etc.
** If you were sick already, eating a tainted corpse re-rolls the number of turns you have left to live, compares it to the current number, and takes the lower of the two. Eating the corpse also takes 1 turn, so you will always be closer to death afterward.
* Otherwise, if the rottenness is at least 4 ("old"), and you are not sickness resistant, there is a 20% chance that you "feel sick" and lose 1d8 HP. Dying from this damage will display the death message "killed by a cadaver".
** If the rottenness is 6 or more but the corpse is not tainted, the chance is 100%. 
** In addition to sickness resistance, you are completely protected from this damage if the corpse is poisonous or you receive acidic damage from it.
* In the absence of other negative effects, unless the corpse is a lizard, lichen, or acidic, there is still a {{frac|7}} chance of a corpse turning out to be [[Comestible#Rotten food|rotten]] in the same sense as non-corpse comestibles, with the associated consequences.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1599|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} 
* Otherwise, you receive the full benefit of eating a fresh corpse.

All unrevived corpses except lizards and lichens eventually disintegrate, quietly disappearing from the game. This happens at an age of approximately 250 turns, with some random variation.{{refsrc|src/mkobj.c|1125|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You have a constitution in 100 chance of surviving food poisoning. If you do, you lose 1 point of constitution and abuse constitution.}}

==Poisonous and acidic corpses==

Every corpse of a poisonous monster has a {{frac|4|5}} chance of being poisonous. If you eat a poisonous corpse while not poison resistant, you lose 1&ndash;4 points of strength and 1&ndash;15 hit points.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1581|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

Acidic monsters always leave acidic corpses. If you eat one while not acid resistant, you "have a very bad case of stomach acid" and lose 1&ndash;15 hit points.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1577|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

==Corpse benefits and dangers==
Acidic and poisonous corpses do 1d15 points of damage.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1580|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} Old corpses sometimes do 1d8 damage.
Corpses not said to have an effect in this article are neither beneficial nor harmful.

===Gaining intrinsics===
Most, though not all, corpse-eating effects are chances of gaining intrinsics. The chance of gaining an intrinsic from a intrinsic-providing corpse is based on the monster's base level and the amount of intrinsics it can provide. If a monster can provide multiple intrinsics, there is an equal chance of each being conferred, even if you already possess the intrinsic. Once one intrinsic is picked from the list, there is a ''level''/15 chance that it will be conferred. [[Telepathy]], [[teleportitis]], and [[teleport control]] are exceptions; telepathy is guaranteed, teleportitis is ''level''/10, and teleport control is ''level''/12. [[Killer bee]] and [[scorpion]] corpses are also exceptions; their chance of conferring poison resistance is (''level''+5)/20.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|840|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1128|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

=== Purely beneficial corpses and globs ===
The following corpses are purely beneficial, save for the few which are acidic.
* All [[elf|elves]] confer [[sleep resistance]].
** Elf players suffer [[cannibalism]] from eating other elves, but they gain sleep resistance naturally.
* [[Wraith]] corpses provide a guaranteed level up.
* All [[giant]]s, [[titan]]s, the [[Cyclops]], and [[Lord Surtur]] provide an increase in [[strength]].
** Fire giants and Lord Sultur also confer fire resistance.
** Frost giants also confer cold resistance.
** Storm giants also confer shock resistance.
* [[Mind flayer]]s and [[master mind flayer]]s provide an increase in [[intelligence]] or confer telepathy.
* [[Floating eye]]s always confer telepathy.
* Blue, black, orange, red, and white [[dragon]]s are all guaranteed to confer their associated resistance: [[shock resistance|shock]] for blue, [[disintegration resistance|disintegration]] for black, [[sleep resistance|sleep]] for orange, [[fire resistance|fire]] for red (including [[Ixoth]]), and [[cold resistance|cold]] for white.
** Gray, silver, and yellow dragons confer no intrinsics.
** Green dragons and the [[Chromatic Dragon]] also confer intrinsics, but being poisonous do not belong to this section.
** Baby dragons confer no intrinsics. 
* All [[naga]]s confer poison resistance, and are additionally safe to eat with the exception of acidic black nagas and poisonous guardian nagas. Red nagas also confer fire resistance.
** Naga hatchling corpses have identical effects to their adult counterparts, but have a lower chance of doing so; guardian naga hatchlings are not poisonous to eat.
* All puddings confer cold, shock, and poison resistance, and are acidic.
** Black puddings are not vegetarian, while brown puddings are vegetarian but not vegan.
* Brown and red [[mold]]s confer poison resistance; the former additionally provides cold resistance, and the latter gives fire resistance.
* [[Blue jelly|Blue jellies]] confer poison and cold resistance.
* [[Gelatinous cube]]s confer fire, cold, sleep, and shock resistance, and are acidic.
* [[Gray ooze]]s confer fire, cold, and poison resistance.
* [[Quivering blob]]s confer poison resistance.
* [[Electric eel]]s confer shock resistance.
* [[Lizard]]s cure stoning, lowers stun and confusion to two rounds, and do not rot.
* [[Unicorn]]s confer poison resistance.
** Killing unicorns of your own [[alignment]] massively lowers your [[Luck]], but eating unicorns of the same alignment has no such effect.
* [[Cave spider]]s confer poison resistance.
* [[Centipede]]s confer poison resistance.
* [[Fire ant]]s confer fire resistance.
* [[Pyrolisk]]s confer fire and poison resistance.
* [[Flesh golem]]s confer fire, cold, shock, sleep, and poison resistance.
* [[Hell hound]]s and their pups confer fire resistance.
* [[Ice troll]]s confer cold resistance.
* [[winter wolf|Winter wolves]] and their cubs confer cold resistance.
* [[Yeti]]s confer cold resistance.
* [[Newt]]s provide 1&ndash;3 [[energy]], or increase maximum energy if already at max.
* [[Quasit]]s confer poison resistance.
* [[Shrieker]]s confer poison resistance. 
* [[Tengu]] confer both teleportitis and teleport control, as well as poison resistance.

As a general rule, monsters with a fiery attack (red molds, red dragons, etc.) tend to confer fire resistance and monsters with a cold attack (brown molds, white dragons, etc.) tend to confer cold resistance.

=== Corpses that are both beneficial and harmful ===

This section lists corpses which both provide benefit beyond nutrition value, and are harmful beyong being acidic, or cause an effect which may be both beneficial and harmful.

The following corpses are poisonous but also confer poison resistance:
* [[green dragon]] (always confers)
* [[Chromatic Dragon]] (always confers one of: poison, sleep, fire, cold, shock, disintegration)
* [[cobra]], [[pit viper]], [[snake]], and [[water moccasin]]
* [[giant beetle]]
* [[giant spider]]
* [[scorpion]] and [[Scorpius]] (the latter always confers)
* [[gremlin]]
* [[guardian naga]]
* [[homunculus]] (also confers sleep resistance; only 7% chance for each)
* [[jellyfish]]
* [[killer bee]] and [[queen bee]]
* [[soldier ant]]
* [[xan]]
* [[yellow mold]] (also causes [[hallucination]]; has only 7% chance of conferring poison resistance)
* [[Medusa]] (kills instantly by [[stoning|petrification]]; if [[Stoning#Stoning_resistant_monsters|stoning resistant]], or saved by [[amulet of life saving]], always confers poison resistance)

Some poisonous monsters are beneficial in other ways:
* [[quantum mechanic]] (always toggles intrinsic [[speed]])
* [[salamander]] (confers fire resistance)

Finally, there are non-poisonous corpses which are good or bad:
* Eating a [[chameleon]] or [[doppelganger]] corpse will [[polymorph]] you. Doppelgangers are human, so beware of [[cannibalism]].
* Eating a [[disenchanter]] corpse is generally bad. One of the following intrinsics is randomly selected:<ref>[Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/eat.c#1034]</ref><ref>[Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/sit.c#attrcurse]</ref> fire resistance, cold resistance, poison resistance, telepathy, invisibility, see invisible, speed, stealth, intrinsic protection, teleportitis, aggravate monsters. If you possess the chosen intrinsic, you lose it. Of these, only teleportitis, aggravate monsters, and invisibility could be detrimental.
* [[Leprechaun]]s and all [[nymph]]s confer [[teleportitis]]. This can be inconvenient if you lack [[teleport control]].
* [[Master Kaen]] confers poison resistance, but being human (and Monks' [[Quest Nemesis]]), he's likely to trigger [[cannibalism]].
* [[Nurse]]s fully heal, and have a 73% chance of granting poison resistance. Nurses are human, so beware of [[cannibalism]].
* [[Cockatrice]] and [[chickatrice]] corpses kill you instantly by petrification, but if you are [[petrification resistance|resistant]] or saved by [[amulet of life saving]], you may become poison resistant.
* [[Stalker]] corpses make you temporarily invisible for 50&ndash;149 turns. If you are already invisible, it will make you permanently invisible and grant [[see invisible]]. Eating one will also [[stun]] you for 60+ turns.
* [[Violet fungus|Violet fungi]] cause hallucination for 200+ turns, but may confer poison resistance.
* The [[Wizard of Yendor]] confers one of: fire resistance, poison resistance, teleport control, and teleportitis. He is a human, so beware of [[cannibalism]].
* [[Giant zombie]]s and [[Giant mummy|mummies]] may increase your strength, but have a high risk of food poisoning that is best avoided by using a [[tinning kit]].
* [[Elf zombie]]s and [[Elf mummy|mummies]] may convey sleep resistance, but can cause food poisoning. As with undead giants, using a tinning kit is best.

=== Corpses that are only harmful ===
The following corpses cause harm without any beneficial effect except nutrition:
* Eating corpses of your own race constitutes [[cannibalism]]. Unless you are an [[orc]] or [[Caveman]], you gain the [[aggravate monster]] intrinsic, and lose 2&ndash;5 points of [[Luck]]. All {{white|@}} except elves, along with all {{white|K}}, are human, including [[werecreature]]s and [[doppelganger]]s. Other races are obvious.
** Eating [[abbot]]s also inflicts hallucination.
* [[Cat]]s and [[dog]]s confer the [[aggravate monster]] intrinsic, unless you are an [[orc]] or [[Caveman]].
* The following are poisonous without beneficial effects: all [[kobold]]s, [[rabid rat]]s, [[baby green dragon]]s, [[vampire bat]]s, and the worst, [[green slime]] globs, which are acidic and will sometimes cause [[sliming]].
* [[Bat]]s and [[giant bat]]s [[stun]] for 30+ and 60+ turns respectively.
* All [[mimic]]s temporarily prevent movement.
* Eating any of the [[Riders]] will kill you. Even if you have an [[amulet of life saving]], they will revive before you can finish.
* All [[undead]] corpses along with those generated on top of [[traps]] can cause [[food poisoning]].
** Tinning undead corpses makes them safe to eat. There is also a small chance that you will not get food poisoning if you eat the corpse quickly enough, but trying it is very dangerous unless you have a [[unicorn horn]].

=== Acidic corpses and blobs ===

The following corpses and blobs are acidic without any other beneficial or harmful effects (nutrition value in parentheses):
* [[acid blob]] (10)
* [[yellow dragon]] (1500) and their babies (500)
* [[green mold]] (30)
* [[ochre jelly]] (20)

== Variants ==
In [[SLASH'EM]], corpses sometimes get overgrown with molds. This behavior has also been ported to [[xNetHack]]. Knowing this, players may get extra resistances or lichen corpses. See [[Fungus#SLASH'EM|Fungus § SLASH'EM]] for more details.

&&%s&& %s Resistance {149269 2022-12-12T07:08:55Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} lede In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''resistances''' are [[properties]] that protect you against several harmful effects that you may encounter in the dungeon. A resistance can be either [[intrinsic]], meaning a natural resistance, or [[extrinsic]], meaning a resistance gained by [[wear]]ing or [[wield]]ing a certain item. Many intrinsic resistances can only be gained by [[polymorphing]] into a certain creature, which is not very convenient.

==Intrinsic resistances==
One of the most common ways to gain intrinsic resistances is through the eating of [[corpses]]. Of special note are [[dragon]] corpses, as they are guaranteed to give resistances based on their color as specified below, with the exception of yellow, gray and silver. Other monsters also provide intrinsic resistances if their corpses are eaten, details of which can be found in the individual monster descriptions.

==Extrinsic resistances==
Extrinsic resistance is obtained, by definition, through items. [[Dragon scale mail]] and the lower [[dragon scale]]s provide reliable methods for many resistances. [[Artifact]]s also often provide resistances, some of which are hard to obtain otherwise.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Resistances conferred by worn or wielded items have a 99% chance of protecting your [[inventory]]; see [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/9942b65df78dd55a7806ec6ea2821693a7131c97 this commit].}}

&&%s&& %s Wizard mode {145026 2022-03-25T02:12:56Z {4001313 Ardub23} /* Levelcide */ Formatted asterisk so it stands out without needing to be between similar-looking quotation marks In NetHack, '''wizard mode''' is a debug mode in which the player may try out anything they might want to test. Games played in wizard mode do not contribute in the [[record file]] but do appear in the [[logfile]].

== Entering wizard mode ==

===Public servers===
[[Public server]]s in general restrict wizard mode access to their administrators, among other reasons to prevent users from creating custom [[bones]] levels to the benefit or detriment of other users.

===Windows===
To get to the wizard mode, you must start the game with the command <tt>nethack -D -u wizard</tt>. The <tt>-D</tt> stands for debug and <tt>-u name</tt> names you ''wizard'', which must be done to enter the wizard mode.

In Windows, for the sake of convenience, you can create a shortcut to wizard mode, so you don't have to access the DOS prompt to enter the above command every time. Right click on the NetHack icon and choose "create shortcut". Right click on the shortcut and choose "properties". In the "Target" text box, type the following, including quotes:
*"<file path and file name>" -D -u wizard
For example, it may look like this:
*"C:\Program Files\NetHack\nethack-343-win\NetHackW.exe" -D -u wizard

===Unix===

On UNIX-based systems, the ability to enter wizard mode is typically restricted to specific user accounts. This means that there isn't a standard way to invoke it which works on all systems. Things which may work include:

* Start the game with <tt>nethack -D</tt>. This may work, or it may take you into [[explore mode]] instead. You will be able to tell as soon as you have restored a file or selected a character. If you are in explore mode the game gives the message "You are in non-scoring explore/discovery mode." If you are in wizard mode it gives no such message.

* Edit a system-wide configuration file (/usr/games/lib/nethackdir/sysconf by default), and then start as above. Adding a username to the WIZARDS line would allow that user to access wizard mode with <tt>nethack -D</tt>: <tt>WIZARDS=root youruser</tt>. Setting WIZARDS to * would allow any user to access wizard mode, which is fine for a single-user system: <tt>WIZARDS=*</tt>. Depending on where the game is installed, editing the sysconf file may require root access.

* Start as root using <tt>sudo `which nethack` -D</tt>. This may start NetHack, and may get you into wizard mode, albeit at a cost of not using a options you may have set in a [[Option#Configuration_file|.nethackrc file]] in your home directory. If you run a system used by others, and have NetHack included with support for the [[shell escape]] command, granting permission to run NetHack with sudo is '''extremely dangerous''', as it would allow the user to create a shell as root without permission being separately granted, and without sudo (with its password prompt and logging) having to be called at the time the shell was launched.
