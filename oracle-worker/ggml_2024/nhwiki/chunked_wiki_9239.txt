When these attacks connect with a target, they create a [[web]] trap at the target's location, entangling the target.  ("The webbing sticks to you. You're caught!")  

While these attacks do no hit point damage, their immobilizing effect can be a serious obstacle to fighting or escaping a difficult situation.

Some examples of monsters that use webbing attacks are high-level [[spider]]s and spider hybrids that try to ensnare you with a [[melee]] kick attack, and web-covered [[drow (monster)#dNethack|drow]] monsters that entangle you [[Passive attack|when you strike them in melee]].

While their attacks are coded differently, the [[edderkop]]'s shadow bolts create web traps at their targets, and the [[Avatar of Lolth]] has a seduction attack which results in webbing.

If you get webbed while [[ride|riding]], you will fall from your steed.  Note that if your steed or other pet becomes caught in a newly created web, trying to [[untrap]] it may cause a new web to appear on your tile.

==Strategy==
{{main|Web}}

The same strategies used to deal with the webs generated in vanilla are also applicable to extricating yourself from and cleaning up the webs left by monster attacks.

If you are encountering many monsters with webbing attacks (for example, on a quest), it may be worthwhile to name [[Sting]] and wield it to cut yourself free, at the cost of incrementing the number of artifacts that have been created.  High [[strength]] (natural or obtained from [[gauntlets of power]]) can also help you tear free from webs.

&&%s&& %s Player's misconceptions {149913 2023-02-10T16:45:33Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Eating pet corpses is bad */ Tense corrected This page attempts to dispel common assumptions and misconceptions that many players may have about [[NetHack]].
<br/>
= Nutrition =
==== Drinking water is necessary ====
The [[Guidebook]]'s advice on this matter is misleading, stating that "although creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is a physiological need for water". Though that is true for real life, [[NetHack is not real life|it surely does not apply for the game]], where there is absolutely no need to drink water at all — instead of being healthy, [[quaffing]] from [[fountain]]s can be downright dangerous.

==== Because corpses are dangerous to eat, they should be saved for emergencies ====
[[Corpse#Corpses_that_are_both_beneficial_and_harmful|Some corpses]] are, indeed, inherently dangerous and should not be eaten. Any other corpse should be eaten while it is still fresh, if you plan to eat it at all. If you save a corpse to eat later, it will almost certainly be [[Corpse#Aging|tainted]] and give you [[food poisoning]]. [[Lizard]] and [[lichen]] corpses are exceptions to this rule, as they last indefinitely.

==== I would not eat that in real life, so my character also probably should not ====
Remember: [[NetHack is not real life]]. Though most of us would not eat a [[Rat#Sewer_rat|sewer rat]] or a (uncooked!) [[jackal]]'s corpse — and would most probably get ill if we did — that is not an issue for your alter ego in the game. Therefore, if a corpse is fresh, unless there is something intrinsically harmful about the monster that dropped it — such as the [[kobold]], which is poisonous, or the [[cockatrice]], which causes [[stoning]] —  it will probably be safe for consuming.

==== Eating pet corpses is bad ====
There is no specific penalty for eating a [[pet]]'s [[corpse]] after the creature is already dead, but there are several similar things that do have bad effects:
* Personally killing the pet incurs a penalty of -15 alignment and -1 [[Luck]].
* Eating a domestic [[cat]] or [[dog]] corpse will give you the [[Aggravate monster]] intrinsic, but this applies regardless of whether it has been a pet.
* [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing_pets|Sacrificing]] pets that have died while tame also gives bad effects and should be avoided.

= Magic =

==== Wizards are better at reading spellbooks ====
In fact, the formula that determines the chance of successfully reading a [[spellbook]] is the same for all roles (and, just for completeness, all races and alignments). The only advantage [[Wizard]]s have in reading books is that, when attempting to read an [[BUC|uncursed]] book with less than 100% chance of success, they are given a warning and prompted whether to continue reading. The actual success chance, however, is the same as for all other roles.

Wizards are, however, better at ''writing'' [[Magic marker#Unknown scrolls and spellbooks|unknown scrolls and spellbooks]] than other roles.

==== The player should not wear metal armor if intending to cast ====
Metal does tend to hinder casting, but some types of metallic armor have much less effect than many players may think. For example, a Wizard with 18 [[Intelligence|Int]] can wear a metal helmet, boots, or gloves and can still cast low-level spells with 0% failure, and will only see a small increase in fail rate for higher-level spells. [[Shield]]s and metallic [[body armor]] interfere with casting the most.

= Behavior =

=== A Chaotic character can kill anything without penalties of any kind ===
Actually, [[Alignment#Chaotic|Chaotic]] characters get alignment and Luck penalties for most of the same things that characters of other alignments do, such as killing coaligned peaceful monsters or [[Murder|killing always-peaceful humans]]. See the [[Alignment record]] page for more details on alignment penalties and bonuses.

=== Offering a human corpse is bad ===
'''If you are playing as a non-chaotic human, this is generally true.''' That said, there is no specific penalty (or bonus, for that matter) for the [[sacrifice]] of human corpses - it's [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|sacrificing one's own race]] that is a special case, and which is almost always a bad idea for non-chaotic adventurers.

= Attributes =

==== Gauntlets of power are required to maximize carrying capacity ====
[[Encumbrance|Carrying capacity]] is based on more than just [[Strength]], and also has a limit. Specifically, the formula is:
 (([[Strength|Str]] + [[Constitution|Con]]) * 25) + 50
Further, the result is capped at 1000. Therefore, if (Str + Con) >= 38, carry capacity is maxed, and all races other than elf can reach this without [[Gauntlets of power]] or any other additional equipment.

It suggests a path through the game that works well for many roles.  You may also wish to consult the [[Role difficulty/Variants#dNetHack roles|role difficulty chart]].

== The Upper Dungeon ==

* Thorough exploration of the first dungeon levels can be very helpful - early special rooms are useful, and you don't want to miss the stairs to the Gnomish mines.
** Obviously, altars are an extremely useful find, but see the altar section below about how to handle them safely.
** [[Dilapidated armory|Dilapidated armories]] are another helpful find.  Rust monsters and brown puddings are only dangerous to your armor, so if you find one you should probably strip out of any armor that would be at risk and punch the monsters to death. Any armor out of non-rustable materials like silver, mithril, crystal or metal can be particularly helpful. Especially look out for [[crystal plate mail]], mithril armor, or uneroded gauntlets - which could be [[User:Chris/dNethack/dNethack Items#Gauntlets with randomized appearances|orihalcyon gauntlets]].
** If you can hear 'scraping in the distance', there is a [[Special room (dNetHack)#Magic item vault|magic item vault]] with either a [[Gizmo#Juggernaut|juggernaut]] or an [[Gizmo#Id Juggernaut|id juggernaut]] on the level. You won't be able to deal with them yet, but they're slow and relatively easy to lure away from the vault if you come back later. You'll need a pick to enter the vault though, and it's recommended to have enough HP to survive an attack routine or two.
* Roles that are weak in the early game will need to exercise caution and good pet management during this phase.  Try to fight newts, grid bugs, and lichens yourself, and enlist your pet's aid for anything tougher. If both you and your pet are next to the same monster, the monster will prefer to target your pet instead of yourself.
* Pets become full after eating several corpses, so starvation should not be as big a threat in dNetHack as it is in vanilla.

== The Gnomish Mines ==

* Gnomes and dwarves spawn in large numbers in the mines.
** This abundance of iron-weapon-wielding foes makes the mines very dangerous to elven, droven, and yuki-onna characters.
** Weak roles may struggle to kill dwarves safely. However, for roles that don't start with a good starting weapon, [[dwarvish short sword]]s are relatively good early-on.
** Large swarms of stronger enemies like dwarves may overwhelm and kill the starting pet. Try to pick them off one by one.
*** [[Bard|Troubadour]]s that can play the lullaby song can clean out the mines much easier.
*** If dwarves are peaceful to you, whether due to alignment or race, you can let your pet kill a few dwarves with little risk.
* As in vanilla, Minetown is a good early goal. Check the tool shop especially, since it can have [[candle of invocation|candles of invocation]] as well as magic lamps or magic markers. Izchak will not sell any however. 
** For a price, shopkeepers can identify items for you.  They can also be used to price id items for you, just as in vanilla. If you can informally ID a valuable gem, maybe with a touchstone, you can pay a shopkeeper to identify it.  It will cost you up to 750 gold, but if it's valuable enough you can resell the gem for a profit. This can be done with your Mine's End haul of gems if you've managed to informally identify any for a large amount of gold and credit. Remember that only general stores purchase gems.
***In dNetHack, "brilliant blue" gems are "magicite", a valuable gem worth 9999 gold (base selling price).  No worthless glass shares this appearance, and it is well-worth spending 750 gold to identify it in a shop. 
* Remember that dwarves drop good armor when killed, so you can probably get some reasonable AC and DR at this point. Look for leather [[dwarvish cloak]]s in particular, or mithril [[dwarvish iron helm]]s for the slight weight decrease and erodeproofing.
* Like in vanilla, you will definitely want to obtain a digging implement (pick or dwarvish mattock) at this point. Mithril or bone picks or mattocks are extremely light - a mithril mattock is 40 wt, compared to the 60 of an normal iron pick.

== Dealing with a Cross-aligned Altar ==

* Gods are much quicker to send in minions in dNetHack.  This is a fairly common cause of YASD for new players.
** Minions are roughly level-appropriate, however they can still be tougher than random monsters.  Early minions include chaotic [[crocodile]]s and lawful [[Archon|Justice Archons]], which are very slow, so kiting can be useful. But it's possible to get monsters as strong as water or fire elementals early, or nymphs of various kinds, which can pose a massive threat. Try to do any altar conversion at under experience level 3, where you will almost never get any minions.
** It's a good idea to have some sort of escape item handy before attempting to convert a cross-aligned altar. If the altar is near enough to the stairs it's likely not worth it though, unless you plan on not coming back to that level for a while.
** Once you have a digging implement and have explored a few levels below the level with the altar, you can pre-dig a few holes to escape through if things go south.  Once the altar is converted, if you care enough you can plug any holes you dug by digging boulders out of the surrounding rock.

== Sokoban ==

* Like vanilla, the next stop (or first stop, if the mines are too dangerous) is often Sokoban.
* The Sokoban scrolls of Earth can be extremely important items.  Enough so that it is probably best to leave at least one safely in Sokoban, where it won't be destroyed by unlucky fire/water attacks etc.
* The boulders are replaced with "massive stone crates", which drop food when pushed into the holes, so you can't grab a couple food rations and keep exploring the main dungeon as easily as before.
* Sokoban uses the standard 3.4.3 levels, so it's possible to tell if you have [[Sokoban Level 4a|"bagoban"]] or [[Sokoban Level 4b|"reflectoban"]] once you reach the final level.
* Reflection overall is less useful than in vanilla, but can be more important in the midgame if you do not have a source of magic resistance yet. A bag of holding is a must-have, can also be found relatively often without clearing Sokoban if it's not needed yet.

== Threading the Midgame Needle ==

At this point, things get really hairy.  If you got lucky with random loot, you may already have magic resistance, reflection, and a decent set of other resistances.  If not, you are now at the part of the game where spellcasters and elemental enemies become increasingly common, but you are still wide open to their attacks.

=== Dealing with an early Big Room ===

If you are even more unlucky, you are now blocked from descending farther into the dungeon by the Big Room level.
* Strategy A: Use a Scroll of Earth from Sokoban to control line-of-sight and protect your flanks.  Be careful not to block your escape.  Either use a blessed scroll, have a pickaxe handy to break the center boulder, or leave your whole inventory on the level above so that you can squeeze back onto the center square after pushing aside one boulder.  Make sure you don't use a cursed scroll of earth.
* Strategy B: Sprint and pray (and sprint).  Any successful prayer in dNetHack scares all monsters on the level. If you can see the next staircase, and can pray successfully, you can use your prayer to scare all the monsters then sprint to the staircase. For maximum safety, wait as long as you safely can before you pray. Remember that since the level is not clear then you're blocked from coming back up until you can deal with it.
* Don't get surrounded on the upstair.  It might sound like a good idea, but every time you go down the staircase you'll get hit up to eight times.

=== Law Quest:  Get teleportitis and teleport control ===

Tengu are are possible spawns in the first section of the Law Quest, with the first cavernous level being the most likely. If you have the food and patience, it's almost always worthwhile to hang out there until you have both intrinsics. This allows you to safely clear large portions of the neutral and chaos quests, as well as your own quest.

=== Chaos Quest: Snag the loot ===

There are three possible Chaos Quest branches. 

==== The Temple of Chaos ====

The Temple of Chaos ("chaos1") is the original chaos branch, and has artifacts that grant slotless extrinsic fire resistance, cold resistance, shock resistance, half physical damage, and magic resistance. It also has a runesword on the first level that has a chance to become [[Stormbringer]]. However, it can be exceedingly difficult without resistances - to collect each artifact you must kill a unique themed Fiend. They have large health pools (800+) and hit hard. Defeating each fiend will allow you to pick up the elemental crystals located at the beginning of the quest. Overall, it is probably the worst Chaos quest for a weak player in the mid-game, since there's really no loot you can grab easily.

This branch has two easily accessed altars, if the RNG was not kind enough to provide one in the upper dungeon. It also allows teleporting on all levels, so you can use your teleportitis/teleport control combo to skip many of the levels (notably, Lich & Kary's levels cannot be skipped due to the downstair locations). The second alignment key is located somewhere on Lich, the Fiend of Earth's level, and the third one is dropped from Chaos.

==== Mithardir ====

Mithardir ("chaos2") is the second possible branch. It is primarily a desert, followed by a series of catacombs (very tight room and corridor levels). The main loot are consumables with temporary effects called [[syllable]]s, and the [[Word of Creation|Words of Creation]]. The words provide slotless [[flying]], [[waterproofing]], and [[regeneration]] for all pets. Overall, this quest is mediocre for the average midgame player, since there's no guaranteed sources of magic resistance or the like.

However, the first level has many shops on it. They're special kinds of shop only found on this level, and can include useful items like amulets, armor, and weapons. You can also find "living masks" ("gilled jellyfish" when unidentified), face-slot items that grant magical breathing when worn. If you're lucky, you'll find an artifact weapon or an amulet of reflection/nullify magic that can help you keep moving forward.

==== Mordor ====

Mordor ("chaos3") is the third and final possible branch. It is a forest, followed by some dark garrison levels, followed by some dark cavernous levels and finally a tower-like borehole. It is by far the best possible chaos branch for an otherwise stuck midgame player. The forest levels have plenty of rings on them, which can be very useful ones like teleport control or teleport, free action, conflict, sustain ability, and more. Shelob's lair has an assortment completely random items, and will almost always have at least something useful. The main enemies for most of it are elves, mordor orcs, and Coure Eladrin.

The biggest threats in this branch are the Nazgul on the fortress levels, and the [[Angband orc]]s on the borehole section. This effectively locks [[Lungorthin]] and his artifacts away for now, until you can come back at a much higher level and clear it. Unfortunately, this means you have no guaranteed magic resistance available - but if you're lucky you'll find a solution to that in Shelob's lair. 

Lastly, there is a guaranteed lawful altar on the ford level at the end of the forest section. The guardian is a [[ford guardian]], effectively a grove guardian with minor spellcasting. You can expect Noviere Eladrin and the like on attempted conversions, so it's quite possibly very safe to use. 

=== Get Magic Resistance ===

There are a couple of options for obtaining magic resistance. 

==== The Quest: Defeat the Quest Nemesis ====

Most Quests contain a Magic Resistance item, either the quest object itself grants magic resistance, or there is some other source of magic resistance nearby.  Quest difficulty varies greatly from role to role.

==== The Chaos Quest: Early loot ====

If you have the Mordor quest, it's worth clearing up to Shelob's lair to see if you can snag a source of magic resistance from there. Alternatively, you may be able to find a wand of death or similar item that could help you clear the quest.

If you have the Mithardir quest, you should check the shops on the first level, and possibly the first Word of Power (flying can be helpful for some quests, like the Healer quest or the Bard quest).

==== Law Quest:  Get Cloak from the Tower ====

If you have shock resistance, it's possible to sprint past Axus in the Law Quest - however, you'll likely get drained a couple levels. If you have drain resistance and shock resistance you should be fine. Note that Axus has a passive paralysis attack similarly to floating eyes or other autons but that lasts for much longer, so be careful not to attack him in melee. Sleep resistance may be necessary for getting through the quinions, and a unihorn will be useful to cure stunning brought on by either Axus or his entourage. 

If you do kill him, make sure to grab the First Key of Law off his corpse while you're there.  Beware, as he will resurrect after a few turns, and any attempt to destroy his corpse will result in his immediate resurrection instead.

For lawful characters, none of this matters as all of the autons should be peaceful if you haven't been sinning. 

The [[Tulani Eladrin]] at the end of the Tower of Law have cloaks of MR, but you need to be strong enough to kill them, and they are quite tough. They cast elemental spells.  Beware them releasing the other Eladrin, you may be able to fight a Tulani, but how about two of them plus a couple other kinds?  

There are lots of soldiers in the upper Law Quest, so unless you have reflection you will also be risking sudden death from a wand of death.  If you go for the tower and are lawful, it's almost always a good idea to grab [[dNetHack artifacts#The Rod of Seven Parts|the Rod of Seven Parts]].

==== Special Levels ====

dNetHack adds the Lost Tomb, the Sea, and the Temple of Moloch as single level branches. The downstairs are located anywhere from the Oracle to the Castle, so you may be able to find one early. 

[[The Lost Tomb]] has a collection of scrolls, spellbooks, and potions mostly, and can provide you with some useful ones occasionally. You may be able to find a scroll of genocide to use reverse genocide with here. 

[[The Temple of Moloch]] is quite hard to clear properly, but can be trivialized with careful controlled teleportation. You can teleport straight into the locked back room, and remain safe, if you know where to teleport to. This may or may not be useful but it's worth checking if possible. If you don't have controlled teleportation this is not at all recommended - you'll likely be wiped out in a heartbeat by one of the hostile priests of Moloch.

[[The Sea (dNetHack)|The Sea]] is the last resort solution, but a reasonable chance at a wish via magic lamp can certainly help you acquire magic resistance. If you have the Sunless Sea or the Sunken City variants, you may have to be very careful - the sharks or deep ones respectively may be too strong for you. The Peanut Island and Paradise Island variants are much easier compared. You'll need a way of either crossing water or lowering a drawbridge intact for the former, and a means of blessed magic mapping for the latter.

==== Go Deep ====

Alternatively, you can try to push down the dungeon in pursuit of more loot, with the Castle wand as a backup plan.  Use telepathy to scout for hard monsters, and a digging implement to bypass tough rooms.

==== Dig for Victory ====

On the other hand, you can make the Castle wand the primary plan instead of the backup plan, and use your digging implement to skip most of the dungeon.  See the [[Digging for victory]] article for more advice.

==== Scrounge for Wishes ====

Quaff every fountain until it dries up, sit on every throne until it disappears, quaff all smoky potions, search high and low for magic lamps.  A way of removing curses is useful, if not essential for this.

==== Reverse Genocide Grey Dragons ====

There is a guaranteed magic marker in the early part of the Lost Cities, and if you can snag a magic marker you may be able to write one. You're likely better off finding a scroll from somewhere else though, unless you're a Wizard with good odds of writing an unknown scroll.

==The Neutral Quest==

The Neutral Quest may be the hardest of all the alignment quests.  If you don't need the Silver Key, then you can probably get by with only the keys from the Lawful/Chaotic quests. 

=== The Upper Neutral Quest (Outlands rings) ===

This region is quite variable in difficulty.  The basic levels consist of mines-style forests, populated largely by neutral [[q|quadrupeds]] and [[C|centaurs]].  However, neutral spiritual beings ([[Rilmani]] and [[Kamerel]]) can also generate here.  Vampire characters will also need to watch out for Argentum (silver) golems.

It is a good idea to have some form of monster detection before venturing into these levels, so that dangerous monsters can be avoided, and interesting features can be more quickly found.  Therefore, it is typically dangerous to enter the Neutral Quest as soon as it is found.  However, powerful artifacts can ocasionally be found in the upper quest, so it is a good idea to explore it eventually.

=== The Lower Neutral Quest (the Lost Cities) ===

The Neutral Quest spikes in difficulty massively when you get the the beginning of the Lethe Waterway.  Lovecraftian monsters start appearing, ranging from the tricky nightgaunts (paralyzing and armor stealing tickle attack) to the deadly [[edderkop]]s (practically undodgeable poisonous shadow attack, and ranged web-spawning shadow bolts).

Deep and deeper ones may also appear. They are roughly equivalent to the Yendorian army (soldiers and co.), but more difficult. They can swim, and will get stronger the more are slain.  They appear in groups, sometimes with a stronger deeper one nearby.  Deepest ones are very rare, but a highly formidable threat.

[[Shoggoth#dNetHack|Shoggoth]]s may appear, but this is rare.  If one is spotted, your best choice is likely to flee immediately.  They are very different from Slash'em shoggoths, with an armor and head sucking attack, in addition to the strong acid touch/passive attacks.

====Alhoons====

These are powerful monsters, equivalent to [[master lich]]es. However, being a form of undead mind flayer, they also have the brain-eating int-draining tentacle attack.  For the most part, they're identical to master liches.  One of these is found on the second level of the Gulf of N'kai, and the second at the temple complex in R'lyeh.  They each guard a key of neutrality, the first and second respectively.

====Priests of the Unknown God====

These monsters are technically hostile, but don't move and can't attack.  You can remove artifacts from the game (with the exception of the Anachronaut and Binder quest artifacts, and the Silver Key) by hitting them with it.  They will "tug gently" on the artifact, and if you let go it will be removed from the game (along with the priest).  If the artifact was a gift, you will anger the god who gave it.

=== The Temple Complex (R'lyeh) ===

This area contains the second Alhoon, 2 priests of the unknown god, The Silver Key, and the Great Cthulhu.  All of these are scattered around the temple altars, of which there are three. If you make it this far then the Silver Key is absolutely worth grabbing.  It grants fast energy regen, in addition to teleport and polymorph control, automatic searching, and [[branchport]]ing abilities.  Even if the Key is placed next to Cthulhu, it can still be recovered as long as the player is careful.

Cthulhu poses his own dangers, see [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack_Neutral_Quest_Monsters#Great_Cthulhu|his article]] for more info.  In essence: he will revive infinitely, has a 400 damage melee attack, and merely seeing him drains 1d10 points of wisdom, which can't be recovered with a potion/spell of restore ability. Luckily, he is generated asleep and is very slow, but confronting him is generally a unwise choice.  He can always be sensed from a distance as an "unknown creature causing you dread".

=== Exiting the Neutral Quest ===

The Neutral Quest is very deep, and [[levelport]]s will be restricted to 1 level up or down unless the Silver Key is held in open inventory.  Because of this, players typically don't venture into the Lost Cities until they are ready to go all the way to R'lyeh.  Once the Silver Key is obtained, it is common to immediately invoke it to [[branchport]] out of the quest, especially if Cthulhu is awake.

==Gehennom: The Abyss and Hells==

3 Alignment keys are needed to unlock the doors at the end of the Valley of the Dead.  You will have no use for the others (and they're un-baggable), and it's probably best to ditch them.  Keeping one co-aligned one for the purposes of unlocking things is possible, but a plain skeleton key will work.

You will go through at least 6 unique demons to get to the vibrating square.  These are divided into 6 levels, in the listed order.  Each level is chosen from a random list of maps, which is the lair of the listed demon(s).  Nessus is always the same map, but the location of the staircase is randomized.  

For the vast majority of the demons, you will need practically a full ascension kit.  In addition, it may be a good idea to bring an extra set of armor.  Dagon in particular can shred your armor, and so can the Elder Priest.  If you don't have 20+ cursed potions of gain level, or entirely clear every single level before exiting, you'll need something to get back up with in case anything destroys your armor.

===Abyss 1===

*Baphomet is very similar to Yeenoghu. He is not forced, but difficult to avoid.
*Yeenoghu is the same as vanilla, with a confusion gaze, paralysis claw, and magic missile spell. He is not forced and almost entirely optional.
*Juiblex has his acid and sickness-based attacks, in addition to a sliming touch. In dNetHack, he will only take 10% of his current health from a wand of digging. He is not forced, but difficult to avoid.
*Zuggtmoy is similar to Juiblex (minus the engulfing), with a sickness counterattack and corrosion/decaying claws.  She is hard to avoid, but not entirely forced.
*Pale Night is entirely optional, and it's best to leave it that way.  It casts strong spells comparable to an arch-lich, and attacking it in melee is a death sentence.  It has a reflexive seduction attack, that will likely disintegrate the player's armor and weapons and has a high chance of killing them.

===Upper Hell===

*Bael is pretty easy to kill, specializing in melee fire damage.  He is entirely optional.  His artifact weapon grants extra fire damage and a chance of a fiery explosion on hit.
*Dispater is a dangerous spellcaster, who can turn the character to stone.  Outside of this, he is pretty standard as far as spellcasting monsters go.  His artifact weapon gives an extra 1d8 physical to his attacks, and can be used by the player to knock back and tame enemies.  Dispater is forced.
*Mammon is highly dangerous to unprepared characters. His breath attack turns the player and their inventory to gold, which can be cured (in the player's case) with a lizard corpse/acid as standard stoning.  His weapon steals items from the target.  He also has a wrap attack can can drown the character, if he uses it over the swamp in his lair. He is forced.
*Fierna and Belial appear together. Fierna does fire damage, and Belial causes clerical spells and has a strong melee.  They are both optional.  Belial has a strong seduction attack, which he uses against female characters. Even with max int and cha, characters only have about a 1/4-1/3 chance of passing it, and they can take strong damage even if they do. 
*The Chromatic Dragon can appear as the demon of the upper hell sometimes.  Her lair is identical to the end level of the Caveman Quest, save the quest artifact. She will drop the [[dNetHack artifacts#Chromatic Dragon Scales|Chromatic Dragon scales]] when killed, which is a nice piece of dragon scale armor.

===Abyss 2===

*Orcus is the same as vanilla, but his wand of death is now an artifact.  It is basically a standard wand of death, but can be recharged infinitely, never broken or wrested, and gives a free zap at zero charges, if the invocation timer is good. Like vanilla, he is forced.
*Graz'zt and Malcanthet are very similar, but don't appear together.  They each begin with a seduction attempt, Graz'zt against females and Malcanthet against males.  If the character passes, they will grant boons.  Graz'zt may grant wishes or genocide monsters, and Malcanthet may give increases to AC or damage. Failure is rewarded with harmful equipment or reductions in ability scores.  However, they may attack characters of the same gender as them out of spite.
*The Avatar of Lolth casts summon spiders often, but is more dangerous due to the intrinsic stealing attack it possesses.  She prefers to cast spells to melee combat.

===Lower Hell===

*Verier and the Liliths appear together, and are optional. Verier is quite simple: he's very slow and has status-effect inflicting claws. However, hurting him causes demons to spawn, and killing him causes a horde to spawn. Daughter Lilith has a electrical trident and theft attack, which can deprieve the character of critical resources.  Mother Lilith has a seduction attack similar to Belial, but she uses it against male characters.  Finally, Crone Lilith is a powerful spellcaster.  They are all optional.
*Baalzebub has a stunning gaze, and attacks with a silvered fire and electricity blasting long sword.  He is forced.
*Mephistopheles and Baalphegor are a fire and ice team, who are pretty easy to kill if a player has both resistances.  Be wary of the [[ancient of death|ancients of death]] and [[ancient of ice|ancients of ice]] on their level, who are powerful in their own right.  They are both optional.

===Brine Flats (Abyss 3)===

*Dagon is highly dangerous. He has powerful armor shredding attacks, a wrap attack, and a confusing and hallucination inducing gaze.  In addition to his high HP, this can destroy important parts of your ascension kit. It's a good idea to have backups of your armor.

*Demogorgon is by far the most dangerous monster in dNetHack.  Most of the standard Demogorgon strategy applies, including the part in big bold capital letters saying "Avoid at all costs."  For unknown reasons, he received a buff in dNetHack, and now has armor-shredding claws, which kill you instantly if you are not wearing armor. He has a paralysis and life-draining gaze, a theft attack, and spellcasting abilities.   If you see him, you absolutely must blind yourself within a single turn.  Otherwise, you're guaranteed to get stun-locked by him.  The best option is to sneak through his level, and if you run into him unexpectedly, flee the level immediately. Make sure he is not next to you when you leave, otherwise he'll come with you.  He is very fast, so this may be quite hard.

*Lamashtu is intermediate in power between Dagon and Demogorgon.  She has a vampiric bite attack, a touch attack that teleports your armor off your body, a second touch attack that teleports you to a random square on the level, and casts two spells per turn (including illness-inducing filth spells).  Should you survive a battle with her, remember to recover your armor (which will be scattered randomly around the level, as a result of having been teleported off your body).  As with Demogorgon, the safest course of action is to sneak through her level.  However, greater care must be taken, as her level's design makes it easier to be spotted.

===Nessus===

Nessus is always one level above the vibrating square.  It's comprised of 5 rooms, with one in the center and four on the outside.  Each room has powerful monsters in them, and three of them (the center and two random other ones) have extra bosses.  

The downstair is located in one of the five rooms. Depending on which one, a fight with one of the three bosses may be forced.  Daemon and Glasya are in two random outer rooms, and Asmodeus is in the center.

Glasya has an intrinsic stealing ability, in addition to powerful acid attacks.  She is fast, and best killed at range.  Luckily, she doesn't teleport to meet you.  Daemon is much more powerful, being a combination of a death knight and arch-lich.  His silver saber deals an extra 1d99 damage against dwarves, humans, and elves, and silver damage vs vampires.

[[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack Devil Lords#Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] is incredibly powerful, unlike his vanilla iteration.  He can quickly kill you if you lack either fire or cold resistance, and if you're not standing on a burned pentagram ward (which limits his damage to around 1/9 of it otherwise).  See the [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack Devil Lords#Asmodeus|main article on him]] for more details, but it comes down to:

*Avoid him.  He's only forced in 1/5 of games, do anything possible to avoid him.
*Bribe him if at all possible.  He'll always ask for anywhere from 9000 to 9999 gold, no matter how much you have.  Make sure Excalibur or The Rod of Seven Parts is not going to anger him.
*Make sure you have burned a pentagram ward. Similar to Verier, Asmodeus's blood forms demons as he is hurt.  As he takes more and more damage, stronger demon types begin to form, starting with manes and working up to Pit Fiends. If the character is standing on a burned pentagram ward, these are not an immediate threat, though the spellcasting pit fiends can be troublesome.
*His listed AC is -99.  Every time you attempt to hit him, a random number between -9 and -99 is chosen for his AC.  This means a high portion of attacks against him will miss.  In addition, his spell casting list includes Cure Self, so you need to deal at least 10d8 damage every 9 turns or so, to deal lasting damage.

==The Elder Priest==

The last challenge is the Elder Priest.  He has a paralysis gaze, tentacle attacks that will destroy your armor, in addition to clerical spellcasting and quest artifact/invocation items/amulet theft.  It's best to kill him with ranged attacks, mainly because of the tentacle attacks. He is always generated with a cloak of magic resistance, which means a wand of death will not work. He is sleep and stoning resistant, though he is not disintegration resistant.  Be warned that he will revive after a couple turns, so grabbing the amulet and quaffing a cursed potion of gain level is a good idea. 

==The Endgame==

This is mostly the same as the vanilla endgame.  Just remember that the Plane of Water will contain deep(er,est) ones, and the [[Archon (dNetHack)|dNetHack Archons]] are changed slightly.  Don't be slowed in the Plane of Air, or the Archons may rapidly finish you off with their silver arrows.  [[Binder (dNetHack role)#The Binder pantheon|Binders]] and [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Anachrononaut_Astral_Plane|Anachronauts]] have their own endgame tweaks (or large changes in the Anachronaut case).

The quest leader is sitting on the throne to the north.  Both the arrival portal and the downstair are located outside the mountain.

===Upper filler level(s)===

These are dark, spider filled forest levels.  There is a large amount of random loot here, most of it in spider webs.  There are 9 [[mirkwood spider]]s and 3 [[mirkwood elder]]s in random places on this level, as well as a large number of [[giant spider]]s.  The upstair is located on the left, and the downstair on the right.

The Dwarf Noble Locate level is significantly more complicated than is typical.

First, the character will have to deal with the [[Watcher_in_the_Water#dNethack|Watcher in the water]] ({{brightmagenta|;}}).  The Watcher will not approach the shore, instead attacking with a limitless number of regenerating tentacles.  The simplest solution is to flee into Moria, as neither the Watcher nor its tentacles will be able to reach very far beyond the threshold.

In order to enter Moria, the character must uncover the secret door and open the indestructible artifact door beyond ({{magenta|+}}).  To open the artifact door, stand next to it, #chat at the door, and type "Mellon" at the prompt.

Once inside Moria, the character should pick up their quest artifact, [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_War-mask_of_Durin|the War-mask of Durin]], from the spot marked {{yellow|Q}}.  Additionally, there is a large amount of random treasure scattered around the level, which the player may wish to store in the [[Container#Magic_chest|Magic Chest]] ({{brightmagenta|(}}).

These levels contain a small army of hill orcs, orc shamans, and orc-captains.  The pillars may contain a few [[Small_piece_of_unrefined_mithril|Chunks of unrefined mithril]].  The upstair is located on the left, and the downstair on the right.

In contrast to the Locate level, the Goal level is extremely straightforward.  There is a small horde of hostile hill orcs and orc-captains to either side of the upstair.  The Quest nemesis, [[Durin's_Bane#dNethack|Durin's Bane]], will wait in the center of the bridge until either attacked or you move adjacent to him.  Beware of his +9 bullwhip, which he will use to disarm you, and his high HP, which allows him to outlast you.  Unlike most nemeses, Durin's Bane will not warp to the upstair when damaged.

The marked [[magic portal]] links back to the Home level.  Be warned that this is a one-way trip!  The portal on the Home level leads back to the Dungeons of Doom, rather than to here; and unless the Watcher was permanently dealt with it likely now blocks a return trip through the Quest.  Make sure you don't forget the Bell of Opening after slaying Durin's Bane!

&&%s&& %s Gnomish Ranger Quest {145450 2022-04-12T13:54:21Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  The '''Gnomish Ranger Quest''' is a revival of the [[defunct features|defunct]] [[Gnome quest]]. It sees Gnomish Rangers challenge the [[Great High Shaman of Kurtulmak]] for [[DNetHack artifacts#The Rogue Gear-spirits|The Rogue Gear-spirits]]. For more information on the quest [[branch]] in general, see the [[quest]] article.

This quest is tightly tied to the [[Gnomish mines]].  All holes and trap doors in the mines lead to the Home level, and the upstair on the Home level leads to [[Minetown]]. The quest portal still links to the Dungeons of Doom at the usual depth.

Gnomes of at least 6th level will be accepted on the quest, and at that point they are likely to be able to complete it, as well.  At least 20 alignment is still required, however.

The main quest enemies are kobolds, though the occasional [[i]] spawns as well.  Sometimes a [[giant spider]] may generate guarding a web trap.

'''Ruggo the Gnome King''' is located on the throne; however, he is no longer the quest leader.  Instead, the '''damaged Arcadian Avenger''' is the quest leader.  She is hidden in the closet behind Ruggo's throne.

The downstair and portal are located randomly in the maze of corridors, the marked upstair leads to a random spot in [[Minetown]].  Until the quest is completed, the upstair is partially collapsed, and the character will not be able to squeeze up it if they are burdened.

===Upper filler level(s)===

This is a Mines-style level.  Indeed, these levels are almost identical to mines levels, down to the guaranteed random tool.

The Great High Shaman of Kurtulmak is located on the altar to Kurtulmak on the left-hand side of the level.  Despite his grandiose title, the Shaman has the same statistics as a regular [[kobold shaman]], and is quite likely to die in one hit.  The Shaman's spellcasting, however, is genuinely dangerous, as he summons lawful [[&]] to fight you.

The portal is located on the shore to the left.  The quest leader is located on the throne in the central building.  The other buildings contain two food shops, a potion shop, and a ring shop.

The [[DNetHack_Artifacts#The_Black_Arrow|Black Arrow]] is located somewhere in the water around Lake Town, you will need some way to retrieve it if you want to use it.

The quest leader is standing on a sack containing the Key of Erebor, a minor artifact.  Make sure to retrieve the key before setting out on the quest, or you will have to backtrack.

The downstair is located on the dock to the north.

The upstair is randomly located outside the mountain.  Note that the front entrance is collapsed, leaving the artifact door on the left as the only way in.  The Key of Erebor must be used to open the door, if you don't have it you will have to return to the Home level and pick it up.

The level is deserted except for [[Smaug]], who is asleep on the downstair with the Quest artifact (but not the [[bell of opening]]).  The central room also contains a huge pile of treasure.  No enemies will spawn on the level until Smaug is slain.

A huge army of orcs is located at the south end of this level, including the quest nemesis, [[Bolg]], who carries the [[bell of opening]].  There is no upstair on this level, preventing retreat.  There is a portal back to the Home level located under a boulder at the south end of the level.

The upstairs appear somewhere outside the central area where Seyll waits. Note that Seyll will offer to let the player switch sides, in which case she becomes the new quest leader, Eclavdra becomes the quest nemesis, and the [[DNetHack_Artifacts#Tentacle_Rod|Tentacle Rod]] becomes the quest artifact.

 You arrive in familiar surroundings.  In the distance, you <see|sense>
 Erelhei-Cinlu, a great city of the Drow.
 
 Your house's fortress is close before you. Something is wrong,
