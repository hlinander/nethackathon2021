Donating to priests in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

Chatting to priests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Priests will only be willing to chat if they are still peaceful,
in their own aligned temple, and have freedom of action; trying to
talk to a priest otherwise will arouse his wrath.

If the priest is talkative, #chatting to him can have various results:

If you have no visible money, the priest will not ask for a donation;
if additionally you are co-aligned with him, and your alignment is
non-negative, your wisdom is exercised, and he will give you "two bits
for an ale" (2 zorkmids; just one if that's all he has, or if he has
no money he will "preach the virtues of poverty.)

Otherwise, you will be asked "for a contribution to the temple". The
outcome depends on how much you donate (in relation to your experience
level), and what proportion of your visible gold this represents.

0 zorkmids    :  "Thou shalt regret thine action!" -1 to alignment
              :  if co-aligned, otherwise no effect.

1 zorkmid to  :  If donation less than one-third of current visible gold,
(200*XL)-1    :  "Cheapskate"; otherwise "I thank thee for thy contribution"
              :  and exercise wisdom.

200*XL to     :  "Thou art indeed a pious individual." If donation
(400*XL)-1    :  one-third of current visible gold or less, no further
              :  effect. Otherwise, "I bestow on thee a blessing" and gain
              :  clairvoyance for 500 to 999 (more) turns; additionally,
              :  if co-aligned and alignment -4 or worse, +1 to alignment.

400*XL to     :  A possibility of receiving protection, as detailed below;
(600*XL)-1    :  if protection not granted, same effects as next case.

600*XL or     :  "Thy selfless generosity is deeply appreciated." If
greater       :  co-aligned and donation greater than one-third of current
              :  visible gold, +2 to alignment (or, if alignment negative
              :  and more than 5000 turns since this effect last occurred,
              :  alignment instead restored to 0); otherwise, no effect.


Protection from priests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you donate between 400 times your experience level in gold and 1
less than 600 times your experience level to any temple priest
(regardless of alignment), you may receive divine protection as a result,
which manifests as an improvement in your armour class. This depends on
your intrinsic (naked, ringless and spell-less) AC as follows:

10           :   AC reduced by 2 to 4.
2 to 9       :   AC reduced by 1.
-9 to 1      :   1/(10-(AC)) chance of AC being reduced by 1.
-10 or less  :   No reduction in AC.

So, intrinsic AC can (with enough money) be easily reduced to 1;
reductions below this point immediately become increasingly unlikely;
and -10 is a hard limit for AC improvement by this method. (Other
means of gaining intrinsic protection, such as divine gift from prayer
or eating rings of protection, will still be available.)

If AC is reduced by donation, "Thy devotion has been rewarded"; otherwise,
"Thy selfless generosity is deeply appreciated", and alignment may be
improved as detailed above.

Starting attributes in NetHack 3.4
Compiled for 3.1.3 by Topi Linkala.
Updated for 3.4.3 by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

The initial statistics for the various classes are computed as follows:

1. 75 points are divided among the six attributes based on the
   following table:

Player Class     STR      INT      WIS      DEX      CON      CHA     REM
~~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~
Archeologist     7-20    10-20    10-20     7-10     7-20     7-10     27
Barbarian       16-30     7- 6     7- 7    15-20    16-30     6- 7      8
Caveman         10-30     7- 6     7- 7     7-20     8-30     6- 7     30
Healer           7-15     7-20    13-20     7-15    11-25    16- 5     14
Knight          13-30     7-15    14-15     8-10    10-20    17-10      6
Priest           7-15     7-10    10-30     7-15     7-20     7-10     30
Monk            10-25     7-10     8-20     8-20     7-15     7-10     28
Ranger          13-30    13-10    13-10     9-20    13-20     7-10      7
Rogue            7-20     7-10     7-10    10-30     7-20     6-10     31
Samurai         10-30     8-10     7- 8    10-30    17-14     6- 8     17
Tourist          7-15    10-10     6-10     7-15     7-30    10-20     28
Valkyrie        10-30     7- 6     7- 7     7-20    10-30     7- 7     27
Wizard           7-10    10-30     7-10     7-20     7-20     7-10     30

The number before the dash gives the minimum value for the attributes.
The REMaining points are distributed between the six attributes using
the number after the dash as percentage probabilities between different
attributes.

So, for example, a Ranger gets at least 13/13/13/9/13/7; the sum of
those attributes is 68, so 7 points are distributed using 30%, 10%,
10%, 20%, 20%, and 10% as probabilities between the attributes.

No attribute can go over the maximum; this depends on race:

Player Race     STR      INT      WIS      DEX      CON      CHA
~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~    ~~~~~
dwarf          18/**      16       16       20       20       16
elf              18       20       20       18       16       18
gnome          18/50      19       18       18       18       18
human          18/**      18       18       18       18       18
orc            18/50      16       16       18       18       16

2. Next, for every attribute there is a 5% chance that it is further
   adjusted by -2 to +4 points. No attribute can be adjusted over
   the race maximum or under 3.

3. The last thing that is done is to adjust strength upwards until
   the character can carry their initial inventory without being
   burdened; if the character is still burdened at maximum strength,
   constitution is increased likewise (not beyond maximum). This is
   especially useful for Tourists, since not only do they have a low
   strength, their food items also weigh a lot.

The effects of real-world time, date and moon phase in NetHack 3.4
Compiled for 3.1.3 by Boudewijn Waijers.
Edited for 3.4.3 by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

NetHack is aware of the time in the real world (or, at least, what it's
told about it by your system clock); certain particular times have
effects on gameplay.

Moon phases and dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The date is only checked when the game is started or restored; if you
keep playing without saving, you'll continue to see the effects even
after the relevant period has passed (or not see the effects even
though it has been reached). NetHack divides the month into eight
phases of three or four days each; thus the full and new moon will be
reported for a rather longer time than your calendar might depict.

Full moon: - you have a chance of not being able to tame dogs at night
             (but you will still make them peaceful and you may try
             again).
           - your dog won't whine, yip, bark, or growl, but will always
             howl when you chat at it, at night (likewise werecreatures).
           - your baseline luck is increased by one.
           - werecreatures are usually in their were-form, especially
             at night.

New moon:  - there is NO effect on your baseline luck.
           - if you are hit by a cockatrice's or chickatrice's special
             hissing attack, and you are NOT carrying a lizard corpse
             in your main inventory, you will always start turning to
             stone. Normally, there is only a 1/10 chance.

Friday the 13th:
           - your baseline luck is decreased by one. Note that prayers
             will be rejected while you have negative luck, so until
             you manage to redress this, dangerous situations will be
             that much more dangerous.

If Friday 13th happens to be a full moon, the -1 and +1 to baseline
luck will cancel out. See gems-343.txt for more discussion of how luck
is calculated.


Time
~~~~
Night (22:00 - 05:59):
           - your chance of changing into a werecreature when you are a
             lycanthrope is one in every 60 moves instead of once in
             every 80 moves.
           - you have a chance of not being able to tame dogs when
             the moon is full (but you will still make them peaceful
             and you may try again).
           - gremlins can only steal intrinsics at night.
           - werecreatures can summon more easily.
           - your dog won't whine, yip, bark, or growl, but will always
             howl when you chat at it, when it is full moon.
           - werecreatures are more likely to be in their were-form,
             particularly when it is full moon.

Midnight (0:00 - 0:59):
           - undead do twice as much damage;
           - you get a different message when entering a graveyard
             ("Run away!  Run away!" instead of "You have an uncanny
	     feeling...".

Leaving and loading bones files in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>

While NetHack is a single-player game, a certain amount of interaction
between games (and, on a multi-user system, between players) is provided
by bones files; levels on which a previous character has died being loaded
into a new game for a new character to encounter, complete with the ghost
of the former adventurer and their belongings (or indeed ghosts, since
bones levels can be themselves left as bones should you die there).

On any given system, only one bones file can be waiting at any time for
each distinct level. For this purpose, special levels are considered
distinct from normal ones; for example, an Oracle level at DL 6 can leave
bones despite the prior presence of a stored bones file for a regular
Dungeons level at that depth, and can be loaded in at a different depth if
that's where the Oracle happens to be located in the new game.


Leaving bones files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some levels are ineligible to be saved as bones under any circumstances,
and should you die on these levels you will never leave a bones file:

Dungeons of Doom levels 1-3*              Medusa's Island
The Castle                                Gnomish Mines level 1 (maybe)**
Mines' End                                Sokoban (all levels)
Quest home and goal levels                Fort Ludios
Wizard's Tower top and bottom levels      Fake Wizard's Tower with portal
Vibrating Square level                    Moloch's Sanctum
Vlad's Tower top and bottom levels        Endgame (all levels)
Any level with a dungeon branch

* This is a consequence of the formula given below
** If at DL3, as a consequence of the formula given below

This means that the following levels are eligible to leave bones and have
bones files loaded for them (provided they don't contain the entrance to
another dungeon branch):

Dungeons of Doom (normal) DL 4+           Oracle
Big Room                                  Rogue Level
Gnomish Mines (normal) DL 4+*             Minetown
Quest locate and filler levels            Gehennom (normal)
Valley of the Dead                        Asmodeus' Lair
Juiblex' Swamp                            Baalzebub's Lair

* Stored bones for Mines level 1 may be loaded at DL3, but not left
  at that depth.

If you die on a level that is eligible to leave bones and for which there
is not currently a bones file on the system, the chance of one being
created is dependent on the depth of that level: 1-(1/(1+(DL/4))) (note that
this, combined with NetHack's use of integer arithmetic, means that no level
above DL 4 will ever leave bones). The only other factor is that you will
not leave bones if you were swallowed or engulfed when you died; "Nothing
else. Not how you died, not what level you were, not what's in your
inventory, not whether it was loaded as bones, not any intrinsics or god
status or nearby monster." (from a Usenet article).

When bones are saved, you and your possessions are saved along with them,
along with the level layout, objects, and monsters. There are, however,
certain modifications made:

You leave a corpse, under most circumstances. If you were polymorphed and
unchanging, it will be that of your monster form (if that can leave
corpses); otherwise, it will be that of your race. No corpse will be left
if you are disintegrated, burned to death, die while unchanging and
polymorphed into a monster that does not leave corpses, or arise from the
dead as a different monster as detailed below. If you are stoned, you will
instead leave a statue containing your possessions.

If you leave a corpse, a grave is created (with the tombstone bearing your
character's name and manner of death) if the location is one where a grave
can occur (a non-trapped "floor of a room" square of open space).

You become a ghost, under most circumstances. If you died by sliming, you
instead arise from the dead as a green slime. If you were killed by any W,
you arise from the dead as a wraith; by any M, as a mummy of your race; by
any V and you are human, as a vampire; by a ghoul, as a ghoul. In each
case, the monster you arise as will be carrying your possessions. If you
are stoned, no ghost is created.

Items that were in your character's main inventory each have an 80% chance
of becoming cursed, if they weren't already. Items that were inside
containers are unaffected, whether the container is cursed or not.

Some monsters will never be saved in bones: the Wizard of Yendor, your
Quest Nemesis and Leader, Vlad the Impaler, and Medusa.


Loading bones files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you first arrive at a level for which bones are eligible to be loaded
and for which a stored bones file exists on the system, there is a flat 1/3
chance that that file will be loaded.

The monsters on the level will have their peaceful status adjusted to suit
the character arriving there (for example, just because the dwarves and
gnomes on a Mines level were peaceful towards the dwarvish character that
died there, doesn't mean they'll be peaceful towards your orc who's found
those bones). In particular, this means that the previous character's pets
will often be found hostile. Monsters in the bones file that are extinct
or genocided in the new game will be removed.

Artifacts in the bones file that exist or have existed in the new game will
be converted to an ordinary non-artifact object of their type, as will the
Quest Artifact for the new character's role. The four Unique Items will
become normal items: the Amulet of Yendor a cursed cheap plastic imitation,
the Bell of Opening a cursed bell, the Book of the Dead a cursed blank
spellbook, and the Candelabrum of Invocation a number of cursed partly-used
wax candles corresponding to the number of candles (of any type) as had
been in the Candelabrum (at least one). Tins of unique monsters will become
empty.


Bones compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generally, bones files created by different versions of NetHack, or builds
on different platforms or with different compile options, will not be
compatible with each other. Bones created by a sufficiently similar build
of the same version on a sufficiently similar platform may be compatible
enough to be loaded; you can move them into place manually, or use a bones
exchange service such as Hearse (http://hearse.krollmark.com/).

Quaffing from and dipping objects in fountains in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

Quaffing from fountains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any randomly-generated fountain will have a 1/7 chance of being "magic",
or "blessed"; there is no way to tell if a given fountain is magic or not.

Quaffing from a magic fountain, non-negative Luck:

3/10: Your hunger is reduced slightly.
        "The cool draught refreshes you." 

7/10: Your wisdom is exercised, and all your attributes are restored to
      their maximum (same effect as a blessed potion of restore ability).
      One attribute is increased by 1 (uncursed potion of gain ability
      effect); if your Luck is 4 or higher, this last effect will increase
      all your attributes by 1 (blessed potion effect). After this effect,
      the fountain is no longer magical.
        "Wow! This makes you feel great!"
        "A wisp of vapor escapes the fountain..."


Quaffing from a non-magic fountain, or magic with negative Luck:

9/30: Your hunger is reduced slightly. (Same as above.)
        "The cool draught refreshes you." 

9/30: No effect.
        "This tepid water is tasteless."

1/30: You see your attributes and exercise your wisdom (as with a
      wand or uncursed potion of enlightenment).
        "You feel self-knowledgeable..."
        "The feeling subsides..."

1/30:  You vomit and your hunger is increased.
         "The water is foul!  You gag and vomit."

1/30: If you are poison resistant, you lose d4 HP; otherwise, you lose
      d10 HP and d4+2 STR and your constitution is abused.
        "The water is contaminated!"
        "Perhaps it is runoff from the nearby <fruit> farm."
           (if poison resistant)

1/30: d5+1 water moccasins are created.
        "An endless stream of snakes pour forth!" (unblind)
        "You hear something hissing!" (blind)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
           (moccasins genocided)

1/30: A water demon is summoned. It has a 80+DL/100 chance of being
      hostile (100% if you have the Amulet); if not hostile, he'll grant
      one wish and then vanish.
        "You unleash a water demon!" (unblind)
        "You feel the presence of evil." (blind)
        "Grateful for his release, he grants you a wish!" (peaceful)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
          (summoning failed)        

1/30: A water nymph is summoned.
        "You attract a water nymph!" (unblind)
        "You hear a seductive voice." (blind)
        "A large bubble rises to the surface and pops." (unblind, water
          nymphs genocided or extinct)
        "You hear a loud pop." (blind, water nymphs genocided or extinct)

1/30: Each item in your inventory has 1/5 chance of being cursed outright;
      your hunger is increased and your constitution is abused.
        "This water's no good!"
      
1/30: You gain see invisible and your wisdom is exercised.
        "You see an image of someone stalking you.  But it disappears."
           (unblind)
        "You feel transparent." (blind, invisible)
        "You feel very self-conscious.  Then it passes." (blind, not invisible)

1/30: You briefly see monsters on that level and exercise your wisdom.
        "You sense the presence of monsters."
      If no monsters on the level (other than you), no visible effect.
        "You have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes."
          (beginner not hallucinating)
        "You have a normal feeling for a moment, then it passes."
          (beginner hallucinating)
        "You feel threatened."  (not hallucinating)
        "You get the heebie jeebies."  (hallucinating)

1/30: You find a random valuable gem or piece of worthless glass and your
      wisdom is exercised. If you have already acquired gems or gold from
      this fountain, a nymph is summoned instead (as above).
        "You spot a gem in the sparkling waters!" (unblind)
        "You feel a gem here!" (blind)

1/30: Monsters on the level flee you for a while.
        "This water gives you bad breath!"

1/30: A number of pools may be created in your vicinity. (Never two
      orthogonally adjacent, never on your square, the more likely the
      closer to you.)
        "Water gushes forth from the overflowing fountain!" (pool created)
        "Your thirst is quenched." (no pools created)

Finally, the fountain has a 1/3 chance of drying up (except
in Minetown, where you'll always get one warning).


Dipping items in fountains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From art1-343.txt:

    If you #dip a single ordinary long sword in a fountain, are at least
    experience level 5, and Excalibur doesn't already exist in your game,
    then there is a 1/6 chance of something special happening to your
    long sword.  If you are lawful, the long sword is converted into
    the blessed, rustless, uncorroded, damageproof Excalibur and you
    exercise your wisdom.  If you are neutral or chaotic, your long
    sword is cursed, loses its rustproofing, may lose an enchantment,
    and you abuse your wisdom.

The fountain then disappears; this will anger the Minetown Watch
whether you've been warned or not, if that's where you happen to be.

In any other case, the dipping is handled normally. First, the object
gets wet and does the appropriate things (scrolls and spellbooks blank,
potions dilute, iron objects rust, lit objects go out, grease washes
off). Then special effects can happen (only 50% chance if wetting
object already caused an effect):

18/30: No special effect.   
        "A strange tingling runs up your arm." (1/18 chance)
        "You feel a sudden chill." (1/18 chance)
        No message (16/18 chance)

4/30: The dipped item is uncursed if cursed.
        "The water glows for a moment." (uncursed, unblind)
        "A feeling of loss comes over you." (item not cursed)

1/30: The dipped item is cursed outright.
        No message.

1/30: d5+1 water moccasins are created.
        "An endless stream of snakes pour forth!" (unblind)
        "You hear something hissing!" (blind)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
           (moccasins genocided)

1/30: A water demon is summoned. It has a 80+DL/100 chance of being
      hostile (100% if you have the Amulet); if not hostile, he'll grant
      one wish and then vanish.
        "You unleash a water demon!" (unblind)
        "You feel the presence of evil." (blind)
        "Grateful for his release, he grants you a wish!" (peaceful)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
          (summoning failed)        

1/30: A water nymph is summoned.
        "You attract a water nymph!" (unblind)
        "You hear a seductive voice." (blind)
        "A large bubble rises to the surface and pops." (unblind, water
          nymphs genocided or extinct)
        "You hear a loud pop." (blind, water nymphs genocided or extinct)

1/30: A number of pools may be created in your vicinity. (Never two
      orthogonally adjacent, never on your square, the more likely the
      closer to you.)
        "Water gushes forth from the overflowing fountain!" (pool created)
        "Water sprays all over you." (no pools created)

1/30: You find a random valuable gem or piece of worthless glass and your
      wisdom is exercised. If you have already acquired a gem or gold from
      this fountain, pools may be created instead (as above).
        "You spot a gem in the sparkling waters!" (unblind)
        "You feel a gem here!" (blind)

1/30 You lose some gold and your wisdom is abused. The amount you lose
     depends on the amount (GP) you have, as follows:
             GP <= 10    : 0 zorkmids
             GP <  100   : GP/10 zorkmids
             GP <= 10000 : d(GP)/10 zorkmids
             GP >  10000 : d(10000)/10 zorkmids
     Gems and gold can now be found in this fountain again.
       "An urge to take a bath overwhelms you."
       "You lost some of your gold in the fountain!"       

1/30 You find (2 * d(height + 1)) + 5 zorkmids, where "height" is your
     height above the bottom level of the current dungeon branch; your
