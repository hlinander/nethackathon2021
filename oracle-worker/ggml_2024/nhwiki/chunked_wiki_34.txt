In SporkHack, Demonbane has been significantly overhauled. It is now a [[silver mace]], and like all revised SporkHack artifacts, it gets +1d5 bonus to hit; it does double damage to demons, provides [[warning]] versus demons and prevents demons from summoning in your presence. It is the first sacrifice gift for [[priests]].

==== Generation ====
Because [[silver]] [[mace]]s are not randomly generated, Demonbane will never be randomly generated.

=== SpliceHack ===
In [[SpliceHack]], Demonbane is a silver long sword that blocks demon gating, does double damage to major demons, warns of demons and can be invoked to toggle [[flight]].

'''Giantslayer''' is a [[neutral]] [[long sword]] that does +''1d5'' to hit and [[double damage]] against monsters with the <code>M2_GIANT</code> flag: [[giant]]s, [[stone giant]]s, [[hill giant]]s, [[fire giant]]s, [[giant mummy|giant mummies]], [[frost giant]]s, [[storm giant]]s, [[giant zombie]]s, [[Cyclops]], and [[Lord Surtur]], but not [[ettin]]s or [[titan]]s.

==Strategy==
Like most of [[the Banes]], this weapon has too narrow a damage range to be particularly useful.  Likely its main use is that it might unrestrict the [[long sword]]s skill for a neutral character, without requiring them to be [[crowned]]; this could be useful for a character who finds [[Frost Brand]] on the floor, for example. Also, unlike some other Banes, it is at least derived from a good base item, so is actually useful against giants.  However, giants are rarely dangerous enough to need a particularly effective weapon to take them out.

==Variants==
=== dNetHack ===
In [[dNetHack]], Giantslayer grants [[warned of monster type|warning of giants]].

=== FIQHack ===
In [[FIQHack]], Giantslayer's double damage is replaced by a +1d20 damage bonus.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], this weapon is removed in favor of [[Giantkiller]], a neutral axe with the same double damage range.  As an axe is a far weaker base weapon than a long sword, Giantkiller is even less useful than Giantslayer.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], Giantslayer warns of giants and prevents the wielder from being knocked back by an attack.

'''Grimtooth''' is an [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is [[chaotic]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is an [[orcish dagger]].

==Generation==
A randomly generated orcish dagger has a {{frac|20}} chance of being Grimtooth. The weapon is also a potential [[sacrifice gift]] for chaotic, non-[[Elven (starting race)|elven]] characters.

[[Player monster]] [[Rogue (player monster)|rogues]] on the [[Astral Plane]] have a have a 25% chance of [[Monster starting inventory|starting with an orcish dagger]] in place of their initial primary weapon&mdash;like all player monsters on the Plane, there is a 50% chance it will be made into an artifact weapon of the same [[base item]].{{refsrc|mplayer.c|229|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} Grimtooth is the only artifact orcish dagger, resulting in a 12.5% chance that a Rogue will be carrying it on the Planes.

==Effects==
Grimtooth has +d2 to hit and a +d6 damage against all monsters. It provides [[warned of monster type|warning against elves]], glowing red when any [[elf (monster attribute)|elves]] are present on the level.{{refsrc|artilist.h|70|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

Despite not having a specific damage bonus against elves, Grimtooth is still considered to "attack" them. As such, elven characters (including those those [[polyself|polymorphed]] into elven monsters) cannot wield Grimtooth, and attempting to do so will damage them in addition to the usual chance for [[artifact blast]]ing.

==Strategy==
Grimtooth's weak base item means that even with its damage bonuses to all monsters, it is effectively on par with a normal [[long sword]] - most chaotic non-elven players will only consider Grimtooth as an obstacle to receiving [[Stormbringer]] through [[sacrifice]]. However, it averages the same damage as a [[crysknife]], without the crysknife's danger of reverting to a [[worm tooth]] or the requirement of a [[scroll of enchant weapon]] to create.

Despite its relatively low damage in comparison to other artifacts, orcish [[Ranger]]s and Rogues are likely to make good use of it until they acquire Stormbringer or [[Fire and Frost Brand|one of the Brands]].

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

|-
| +7 Grimtooth
|<math>\frac{1+3}{2}+\frac{1+6}{2}+7=\bold{12.5}</math>
|}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Grimtooth gives a flat +6 damage bonus as opposed to 1d6, but is still outshined by the many better artifacts present, particularly for chaotic players. It might be a decent choice for twoweaponing, which is allowed for artifacts in SLASH'EM.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], Grimtooth is permanently [[poison]]ed and deals +d6 damage against non-[[Poison resistance|poison resistant]] monsters, with a 10% chance of killing them instantly - this makes it markedly more useful. Grimtooth is also the first sacrifice gift for [[Rogue]]s.

===dNetHack===
{{main|dNetHack artifacts#Grimtooth}}
In [[dNetHack]], Grimtooth has +d5 to-hit, doubled damage, and warning against elves, [[human (monster attribute)|humans]] and [[minion]]s. It can be created by naming an orcish dagger, and can be [[twoweapon]]ed as a secondary weapon.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], Grimtooth is permanently poisoned - however, the removal of poison instadeath makes it less powerful than in UnNetHack. Its base price is raised from 300 to 1000.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Grimtooth has a disease-incuding attack in lieu of poison that also has a {{frac|6}} chance to inflict [[sickness]] on the target. Grimtooth also deals extra damage to elves and has a chance to instakill any elf it hits (including an elven player). Additionally, it can be [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forged]] together with [[Stormbringer]] to create [[EvilHack#Forged Artifacts|Shadowblade]], an artifact [[athame]].

The sickness inflicted by the disease attack can be used to dispose of otherwise-hard-to-hit targets, such as powerful [[player monster]]s, that do not have an immunity or a means of curing it. You still take credit and gain experience for monsters that die of terminal illness this way.

'''Ogresmasher''' is an [[unaligned]] [[artifact weapon]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. Its [[base item]] is a [[war hammer]]. It has a +d5 [[to-hit]] bonus and does [[double damage]] against [[ogre]]s; when wielded, it also sets the wielder's [[constitution]] to 25.

==Strategy==
Like most of the [[Banes]], Ogresmasher is considered weak due to its target class of monster being both uncommon and relatively not very dangerous. Ogresmasher is further hampered by its weak base damage, and is outperformed by a regular +0 [[long sword]].

However, its other effect gives it a somewhat niche application, where it can be wielded before leveling up to improve HP gains per level - a character with 25 constitution will gain 1 more HP per level over a character with 18 constitution, and at XL 11 or above they will regenerate slightly more HP depending on the character's [[experience level]] (up to 21 HP [[Hit points#Hit point regeneration|per three turns]] at level 30). In this regard, Ogresmasher may be of interest to [[Elf (starting race)|elven]] characters.

==History==
Ogresmasher was introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]], where its base item was a [[lucern hammer]] - this, along with [[Thunderfist]] (now [[Mjolnir]]), was the result of a likely error on the [[DevTeam]]'s part that confused a lucern hammer for an actual war hammer. Both had their base items changed to war hammers in [[3.0.3]].

Its ability to boost the wielder's constitution was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.1]] and adapted from [[SporkHack]].

==Variants==
===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Ogresmasher grants [[warned of monster type|warning against ogres]] and instakills them upon hitting; it sets constitution to 25 when wielded, and can also be two-weaponed. Characters in dNetHack who aren't capable of two-weaponing and have no need of the second weapon slot can get increased max HP by keeping Ogresmasher in the off-hand. The 25 constitution will grant a character with 14 consitution about 5/3 as much health, since it applies retroactively to all health gained from leveling up.

===FIQhack===
In [[FIQHack]], Ogresmasher's double damage is replaced by a +1d20 damage bonus. Additionally, wielding Ogresmasher set your constitution to 25.

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], Ogresmasher sets the wielder's constitution to 25 when wielded. It also deals an extra +d4 damage to all monsters and has a 50% chance of instantly killing ogres.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNethack]], Ogresmasher grants warning against ogres, deals an extra +d4 damage to all monsters and has a 50% chance of instantly killing ogres. It sets the wielder's constitution to 25 when wielded.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], Ogresmasher's base cost is now 1200zm, and it has been significantly buffed: it deals +d8 to all monsters and has heavy critical hits, which crush and instakill small or tiny monsters and disable medium or larger monsters.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], Ogresmasher warns of ogres and has a chance of slamming monsters into the ground, creating a [[pit]] and doing an extra 2d5 damage.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Ogresmasher warns of ogres and has had its base weapon type changed from a war hammer to a heavy war hammer, which deals significantly more damage. Additionally, it can be [[Forge (dungeon feature)|forged]] together with [[Trollsbane]] to create [[EvilHack#Forged Artifacts|Ashmar]], an artifact [[dwarvish roundshield]].

'''The Staff of Aesculapius''' is the [[Healer]] [[quest artifact]]. It is the prize for completing the [[Healer quest]], and is [[neutral]] for [[wish]]ing purposes. Its base item type is a [[quarterstaff]].

==Effects==
The Staff of Aesculapius gives hungerless [[regeneration]] and [[drain resistance]] while wielded, and deals [[double damage]] to all monsters without [[drain resistance]] and drains levels from them - the life-draining itself applies a further +1d8 damage to the target's current and maximum HP, and restores half of that damage to the wielder's current HP. This bonus damage is not doubled, and does not apply against monsters with drain resistance.

When #[[invoked]], it heals you by half of the HP needed to return to full health and cures [[sickness]], [[blindness]] (unless it was caused by gunk, as from a [[cream pie]]) and [[sliming]].{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1455|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=code for <code>HEALING</code> effect}}

==Strategy==
:''See also: [[Invoke#Optimum invocation schedule|Invoke § Optimum invocation schedule]]''

For Healers, the Staff when wielded by the [[Cyclops]] ensures that you will want to avoid melee range if at all possible, or else be able to dispatch him quickly; failing that, they can exploit his lack of magic resistance or [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR score]] using the wands and spells at their disposal.

Like all staves, The Staff of Aesculapius is [[two-handed]], and the danger of a curse staff and an abundance of drain-resistant hostiles in [[Gehennom]] makes it a somewhat unpopular late-game weapon. However, as an [[intelligent artifact]] the Staff resists 80% of all curses - [[half spell damage]] and/or [[magic resistance]] can reduce the odds of it being cursed even further. The #[[tip]] [[extended command]] also ensures that you can still get to any bagged [[holy water]] or {{? of|remove curse}} scrolls with a cursed Staff in your hands.

The Staff of Aesculapius is the only neutral artifact that provides drain resistance, making it a tempting (though ultimately optional) wish candidate for other neutral characters.

===Average damage calculation===
The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

|}

==History==
The Staff of Aesculapius is introduced along with most of the other quest artifacts in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, the #tip command did not exist, making it perilous if the Staff's resistance fails to prevent it from becoming cursed. The Staff of Aesculapius was also occasionally used in [[drain for gain]] strategies.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Staff of Aesculapius}}
In ancient Greek mythology, the Staff of Aesculapius - primarily known as the Rod of Asclepius, and also known as the "asklepian" - is a serpent-entwined rod, {{white|⚕}}. The Caduceus of [[Hermes]], {{white|☤}}, is a similar symbol of commerce with ''two'' snakes around it, and both staves were gifted to each deity by Apollo - as a result, the caduceus often occurs in similar contexts due to being confused with the Rod, and is likely the reason Hermes serves as the neutral [[god]] of the Healer pantheon. 

Aesculapius (or Asclepius) is one of the sons of Apollo, and a deity associated with the healing aspect of medicine - the snake and staff are separate symbols of Asclepius that may represent the dual natures of medical practice and drugs as capable of either inducing sickness and death, or bringing health and extending life. Snakes were also considered sacred beings of wisdom, health and resurrection by ancient Greeks, partly by virtue of regularly shedding their skin; the staff is interpreted as a walking stick, and thus a symbol of support and growth. One of Asclepius's more famous temples was located on the island of Kos, where the legendary "father of medicine" [[Hippocrates]] is said to have begun his career - the Oath attributed to him (as seen in the encyclopedia entry for the Healer) swears by "Apollo the physician, and Aesculapius, and Health, and All-heal", the latter two of which refers to Asclepius's daughters, Hygieia and Panacea.

As a mortal, Asclepius was educated by Apollo and - more formally - by the centaur Chiron in the art of medicine. Some stories assert that Asclepius was his original name, while others suggest that he was originally named Hepius and received his new name from curing a ruler named Ascles, who suffered an eye ailment that was thought incurable. Asclepius eventually became so proficient as a healer that he could evade death and bring others back to life; this led to Zeus killing him with a thunderbolt when either Hades began accusing Asclepius of stealing his subjects, or Zeus himself became afraid that Asclepius would teach the art of resurrection to others. Apollo retaliated by killing the Cyclopes who made Zeus's thunderbolts, which led to his temporary banishment from Olympus; Asclepius's body was placed among the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus. Zeus later resurrected Asclepius as a god upon Apollo's request, and gave him a place on Olympus.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], The Staff of Aesculapius no longer protects against life drain, although the encyclopedia entry describing the artifact is unchanged.{{refsrc|artilist.h|350|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2|comment=The Staff has <code>NO_DFNS</code> in place of the vanilla <code>DRLI(0, 0)</code>}} Fortunately, there are more sources in SLASH'EM, such as the [[amulet of drain resistance]]. Finding a source of drain resistance also makes facing the Cyclops as a Healer much less perilous, leaving his strong weapon attacks to contend with.

In addition, the #tip command does not exist here, so players using The Staff of Aesculapius should keep at least one means of uncursing it in open inventory - the {{frac|4|5}} chance of resisting curses still works in The Staff's favor, as does having magic resistance and/or half spell damage.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], The Staff of Aesculapius is a [[silver]]-shod quarterstaff, and appears as a '''serpent-entwined staff''' when unidentified. The silver grants it more utility as an offensive weapon for Healers in Gehennom, and dNetHack additionally has the #tip command, as well as various other sources of curse resistance and removal.

===SlashTHEM===
[[SlashTHEM]] both adds the #tip command from later versions of ''NetHack'' and restores the Staff's drain resistance.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
This staff is considered sacred to all healers, as it truly
holds the powers of life and death.  When wielded, it
protects its user from all life draining attacks, and
additionally gives the wielder the power of regeneration.
When invoked it performs healing magic.

A '''potion of water''' is, as one would expect, water. Potions of water can be created by [[Potion#Dilution|diluting]] any potion (except [[Potion of acid|acid]]) twice in a [[fountain]] or body of water such as a [[pool]]. Water produced this way will always be uncursed.

== Effects ==

[[Quaffing]] an uncursed potion of water gives you d10 nutrition and displays the message "This tastes like water".

[[BUC#Changing_the_BUC_status_of_an_item|Changing the BUC]] of an uncursed potion of water can create a potion of [[holy water]] or [[unholy water]]. Usually this requires dropping the water on an altar and [[Prayer#Water_prayer|praying]].

=== Dipping ===
{{main|wet}}

If you [[dip]] an object into an uncursed potion of water, it will become [[wet]]. (Metal objects [[rust]], [[potion of acid|potions of acid]] explode, scrolls become [[blank scroll|blank]]...) This is typically useless, because you can just dip into a different source of water such as a fountain or pool.

Dipping an object into either holy or unholy water does ''not'' make the object wet. In brief, holy water will uncurse or bless an object, while unholy water will unbless or curse an object; then the potion is used up and disappears (or you have one less potion in your stack). You can dip an entire stack of objects each time.

== Identification ==
The [[Guidebook]] states that every '''clear potion''' is a potion of water. Thus water is the one type of potion that you can identify by appearance. (No one expects water to be red or smoky.)

[[Uncursed]] potions of water have a base price of 0; they are commonly sold for about 5 [[zorkmid]]s. Potions of holy water and unholy water have a base price of 100.

Formally identifying any clear potion will provide [[discoveries]] knowledge that all clear potions are potions of water. Once discovered, every identified-blessed clear potion is listed as a [[potion of holy water]], while every identified-cursed clear potion is listed as a [[potion of unholy water]].

== Strategy ==

Many players accumulate potions of water in order to produce large amounts of [[holy water]] or [[unholy water]]. This is much more useful than dipping items into water or quaffing the water.

&&%s&& %s Wand of nothing {146377 2022-06-28T23:33:41Z {4000251 Netzhack} /* Effects */ {{wand
 |name=nothing
 |cost=100
 |type=random
 |maxcharges=8 or 15
 |abundance=2.5%
}}

The '''wand of nothing''' is a [[wand]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Effects==
True to its name, the wand does absolutely nothing when [[zap]]ped, [[engrave]]d with, or broken by [[apply]]ing. Nevertheless, it has charges like any other wand.

A wand of nothing can either be non-directional, giving no feedback whatsoever when zapped, or prompt for a direction, then do nothing with it; each variant is equally likely. The variant is randomly determined per-game, not per-item, so if you find a non-directional wand of nothing, all other wands of nothing in that game will also be non-directional. Whether the wand is directional or not determines how many starting charges it has (4-8 if directional, 11-15 if non-directional).

A wand of nothing is non-magical, and so doesn't lose its charges to [[cancellation]]. As the only non-magical type of wand, it will usually turn into a magical wand when polymorphed.

Note that the message '''"Nothing happens."''' isn't associated specifically with the wand of nothing, but with any wand that's out of charges. A wand of nothing only produces this message when it happens to be out of charges.

==Strategy==
The wand of nothing's properties tend to interfere with identifying other wands; however, the only other wand with a base price of 100 zorkmids is the [[wand of light]], which is very easy to identify and safe to zap or engrave with. Only 25% of all price 100 wands are wands of nothing. It can also be formally identified by elimination once all wands are known that produce no message when engraving. 

The wand of nothing's only real use is as [[polyfodder]]. Converting it to any other magical wand will keep its amount of charges intact, which is especially useful if it's the non-directional variant with more charges.

==History==
Prior to [[NetHack 3.6.0]], all wands of nothing were directional.

==xNetHack==
In [[xNetHack]], wielding a wand of nothing gives a bonus when [[spellcasting]], increasing the player's effective intelligence score by 5 when calculating the energy cost. This effect is the same as wearing a [[robe]] or wielding a [[quarterstaff]], and these effects do not stack.

 |cost=100
}}

Wearing a '''ring of hunger''' conveys the [[hunger (property)|hunger extrinsic]], which causes you to burn [[nutrition]] very quickly; every even-numbered [[turn]] your nutrition is decremented. It is usually generated cursed.

==Identification==

Dropping a ring of hunger into a [[sink]] produces the message, "Suddenly, <item> vanishes from the sink!" but only if there's another item on the sink. Otherwise, "You hear the ring bouncing down the drain pipe." This will not give you a chance to name the ring.

==Strategy==
The ring of hunger is not an ''entirely'' useless ring, but would only be worn in rare circumstances. If, for example, one wanted to eat multiple [[giant]] corpses without an [[amulet of magical breathing]], you might wear this ring to make more room for the meal. Another use is getting weak of hunger more quickly while wearing a [[ring of sustain ability]] to remove it and gain strength this way (no longer possible in [[NetHack 3.6.1]]). However the [[ring of regeneration]] and the [[ring of conflict]] also come with additional hunger while actually doing something useful, making this ring primarily used as [[polyfodder]].

Their first [[Sacrifice#Gifts|sacrifice gift]] is [[Magicbane]]. They are relatively poor fighters, but are arguably the best [[spellcaster]]s in the game. The [[guidebook]] says of them:

{{guidebook|Wizards start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection of magical items, and a particular affinity for dweomercraft. Although seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an experienced Wizard is a deadly foe.}}

==Starting equipment==
A wizard begins the game with:{{reffunc|u_init.c|Wizard initial inventory|nethack=3.6.0}}
* a [[blessed]] [[enchantment|+1]] [[quarterstaff]]
* a [[cloak of magic resistance]]
* three random [[scroll]]s
* a blessed [[spellbook of force bolt]]
* a random non-force bolt [[spellbook]] of level 3 or lower {{refsrc|u_init.c|1027|nethack=3.6.0}}
*three random [[potion]]s
* two random [[ring]]s
* one random [[wand]]
* if an [[Elf (starting race)|elf]], random non-magical [[musical instrument]]{{reffunc|u_init.c|Elf initializations|nethack=3.6.0}}
* 20% chance of [[magic marker]]{{reffunc|u_init.c|Wizard initializations|nethack=3.6.0}}
* 20% chance of [[blindfold]]

The random items generated will <em>never</em> be any of the following:{{refsrc|u_init.c|1007|nethack=3.6.0}}
* [[scroll of amnesia]]
* [[scroll of blank paper]]
* [[scroll of fire]]
* [[spellbook of blank paper]]
* [[potion of acid]]
* [[potion of hallucination]]
* any ring with an enchantment of +0 or lower{{refsrc|u_init.c|1036|nethack=3.6.0}}
* [[ring of aggravate monster]]
* [[ring of hunger]]
* [[ring of levitation]]
* [[ring of poison resistance]] if an [[orc (starting race)|orc]]
* [[ring of polymorph control]] ''if'' you already have a [[wand of polymorph|wand]], [[ring of polymorph|ring]], or [[potion of polymorph|potion]] of polymorph
* ring or potion of polymorph ''if'' you already have a ring of polymorph control
* [[wand of nothing]]
* [[wand of wishing]]

==Intrinsics==
*Level 15: [[warning]]
*Level 17: [[teleport control]]

==Skills==
{{Wizard skill table}}
Wizards start always with ''Basic'' [[skill]] in [[quarterstaff]], [[attack spells]], and [[enchantment spells]]. This is independent of the category of the random spellbook, because the spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function ''skill_init'' in [[weapon.c]].

==Special rules==

===Spellcasting===

Wizards with an intelligence of 15 or 16 have [[reduced-hunger casting]], and Wizards with an intelligence of 17 or above have hungerless casting.

Wizards have no bonus or penalty for [[emergency spell]]s, but their special spell is {{spell of|magic missile}}, which is probably the most useful special spell among the spellcasting roles.

Wizards regain [[energy]] more often than other roles.

===Reading and writing===

Wizards can write scrolls and spellbooks they don't know yet with [[Magic marker#Unknown scrolls and spellbooks|much higher success rates]] than other roles. With maximized Luck, writing one is nearly a certainty.

Wizards get a warning when they have a chance of failing to read an uncursed spellbook: "This spellbook is [very] difficult to comprehend. Continue?"

===Miscellaneous===
[[Cornuthaum]]s give Wizards a [[charisma]] boost and [[clairvoyance]], and only Wizards can safely enchant them from up to +5.

Wizards cannot [[multishot|fire multiple projectiles at once]] unless they are Expert at the relevant weapon skill, and do not gain a multishot bonus for their racial [[launcher]].

Wizards with [[teleportitis]] can teleport at will at experience level 8 or higher, rather than 12 as with other roles. Wizards also spend less time as a [[beginner]] than other roles.

==Strategy==
=== Character creation ===
Among all roles, Wizards have the greatest variation in their starting items. Some players like to "start scum", quitting and rolling new Wizards repeatedly until they start with desirable items and spells.

* Humans make the hardiest Wizards with their relatively high [[HP]] growth; their [[energy]] growth is competitive as well. On the downside, their lack of [[infravision]] makes it somewhat difficult to target spells at distant monsters until they obtain a source of [[warning]] or [[telepathy]] (usually via [[ring of warning]] or [[floating eye]]).
* A gnomish Wizard will face a relatively peaceful [[Mines]]; although Wizards generally want to solve [[Sokoban]] first for the guaranteed food and [[strength]] training, they should still tackle the Mines at some point for access to [[Minetown]] and the guaranteed [[luckstone]]. Their higher maximum [[intelligence]] and bonus to energy growth are obvious advantages, but their hit points are mediocre.
* Orcs are crippled by their penalties to HP and energy growth. Unlike other orcs, orcish Wizards start with no bonus food; their maximum intelligence makes uncursed [[spellbook]]s slightly riskier to read, and requires a [[helm of brilliance]] for hungerless casting. With that in mind, 16 intelligence is still enough for 100% reliable spellcasting, and they also gain modest benefits from [[poison resistance]]. While Wizards are generally frail enough that they should worry more about death from HP than a poison [[instadeath]], their low intelligence cap tends to distribute more points towards their physical stats, making them somewhat better at early-game combat than gnomes and elves - just how much varies greatly between individual characters.
* Elves have the highest energy growth of any race, but due to their low maximum [[constitution]], their HP tends to lag far behind other races. If they're lucky enough to start with the maximum 20 intelligence, they'll have a relatively easy time reading new spellbooks, although this comes at the expense of their other attributes. Their maximum natural strength and constitution aren't enough to reach maximum [[encumbrance]], and [[gauntlets of power]] might not be a viable option due to their spellcasting penalty.

Chaotic characters have the usual benefit of a less malicious [[mysterious force]], although since they can acquire [[teleport control]] by leveling up, they can recover relatively easily from being sent down in Gehennom. Chaotic gods grant more prayer timeout reduction from [[sacrifice]], which is a boon to a Wizard who wants to altar farm for spellbooks. Being neutral is of relatively little benefit to a Wizard unless they want to wish for a specific [[quest artifact]].

=== Skill slot management ===
It takes 6 [[skill]] slots to reach Expert in [[dagger]]s, and 20 slots to max out all the spellcasting skills. This means that a level 30 Wizard who chooses to enhance all spellcasting skills to maximum should have 3 slots free to spend on other skills, such as unrestricted [[artifact weapon]] skills.

As part of skill slot management, a Wizard should defer enhancing any spell skill until there comes a point when doing so would provide an in-game benefit. The benefits from enhancing a spell skill are that it lowers spell failure rates, and (depending on the spell) sometimes augments the effects of a spell. When advancing spell skills, it is a good idea to check which spells you have in each school, and make sure that at least one of your spells would benefit from being enhanced, before using up the skill slot.

It is important to note that a great many spells enjoy augmented effects when advancing from Basic to Skilled (notably, {{spellbook of|fireball|cone of cold|remove curse|and=1|detect monsters}}), but only two spells enjoy augmented effects when going from Skilled to Expert (namely, {{spellbook of|jumping|and=1|protection}}), and of these two, Wizards can only become Expert in jumping. Therefore, for spells other than [[escape spells]], a Wizard gains no benefit from advancing to Expert unless there is a currently known high level spell (e.g. {{spellbook of|finger of death|cancellation|or=1|polymorph}}) whose failure rate would be lowered by such advancement.

In particular, there is almost never any need to advance [[divination spells]] to Expert, since all divination spells have the same effects at Skilled as at Expert, and none of the divination spells are of very high spell level. The Skilled casting effects of [[enchantment spells]] and [[healing spells]] may also not be worth the skill slots. The skill slots saved thereby are valuable to have available for weapons, especially early in the game.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Once you no longer need to throw daggers, a [[scroll of amnesia]] may reset your dagger skill, freeing those slots to be spent on spell skills. You may also forget spells and spell skills, but you can relearn your spells from your books and retrain your skills quickly with the energy regeneration from the Eye.}}

===Early game===
====Objectives====
Some people advocate deliberately keeping your [[experience level]] low in the early game, but this is controversial. Increases in monster [[difficulty]] due to a higher experience levels are roughly balanced out with the benefits that come with the higher experience level, such as higher maximum [[power]]. The easiest way to prevent yourself from over-leveling is to allow your pet to kill as many monsters as is feasible, although one would be wise to still gain a few levels for the additional survivability and spell power capacity. These constraints are loosened when you learn [[magic missile]], get [[Magicbane]], or obtain some other offensive upgrade.

Unless you are playing an [[atheist]], if you manage to find an early coaligned altar, consider sacrificing at it until you get Magicbane, which will make your early game a lot easier.

The Mines are dangerous. Unless you are a gnome, all the normal inhabitants will want to kill you. It can be quite hard for inexperienced players to go straight to Minetown and survive long enough to return to the main dungeon. Exploring the deeper Mines past Minetown should perhaps be postponed, though you do eventually want to get there, as the [[Catacombs]] can be very profitable for a Wizard. 

Completing Sokoban before doing anything else is likewise dangerous, because monsters difficulty increases with each completed puzzle, and your own experience level will probably not keep up with it.

Consider going down to the Oracle level and breaking the centaur statues there in search of spare spellbooks, gaining a few levels in the process, then coming back up to do the Gnomish Mines.

Hunger may become an issue, especially if you do not start the game with Intelligence of 17 or above for hungerless casting. You may need to pray for food when weak, and the first floor of Sokoban with its guaranteed food might be a good place to go to stock up.

====Weapons====
Early-game Wizards are very weak and should avoid engaging in melee combat with monsters. Finding a source of thrown weapons to damage or kill monsters before they can reach you is critical. 

Most Wizards pursue [[daggers]] as their sole weapon skill, because it is easy for them to get Magicbane (which uses dagger skill), and because throwing daggers at Expert skill later in the game does considerably more damage than using a [[quarterstaff]]. To that end, training daggers as soon as you come across some is a good idea. Easy ways to train daggers include throwing them at slow enemies, letting a [[fog cloud]] engulf you, or [[Sting|naming Sting and training it on goblins]] for the +d5 to-hit bonus. Descending briefly into the [[Gnomish Mines]], where daggers are plentiful, is a good way to acquire some.

Still, in the very early game, daggers may be hard to come by, so consider casting [[force bolt]] at a [[boulder]] or [[statue]], picking up the resulting [[stone]]s (as many as can be carried while staying unburdened), and [[quiver]]ing them. Throwing rocks at a monster is better than nothing, especially if you're out of power. Of course, you should replace them with [[dart]]s, [[dagger]]s, or other missiles as they become available.

Some players advocate dumping the starting quarterstaff early on, either as soon as you find a non-cursed [[dagger]] or you reach Basic skill in daggers. There is little reason to keep the staff after this point unless you plan to wish for [[the Staff of Aesculapius]], in which case you should continue training quarterstaff skill. The Staff of Aesculapius has become a more viable choice with the advent of the #[[tip]] command in [[Nethack 3.6.0]], as you can now access the means to uncurse it in the unlikely event it should become cursed while you are wielding it. In addition to having good damage, it provides hungerless [[regeneration]] and [[drain resistance]].

====Spellcasting====
Players disagree on whether Wizards should wear high-AC metal armor and focus on melee skills, or ignore all metal armor in favor of being able to use spells in combat. Wearing metal is fine if it doesn't encumber you and you're confident in your ability to survive without relying on magic. Not wearing it is fine if you're prepared to flee from monsters when you run low on energy. If you do choose to wear metal, you should plan to swap it out later for nonmetal armor as that gradually becomes available.

Save your energy for when you really need it. You won't be able to cast force bolt more than a few times until you gain a few levels. 

Read any non-cursed spellbook as soon as you find it. You will always get a warning if there's a chance of failing to read it, and if you do, it's likely to be too high level to be of much use right now.

If you start with a [[wand of polymorph]], you may consider polymorphing your starting spellbooks. Your force bolt book, since it is blessed, will polymorph into another blessed book that can thus be read with a 100% success rate. However, this can be done only once or twice before the spellbook becomes too faint to read. You can also polymorph your starting pet at the same time, often ending up with something much stronger for an early pet (though this risks killing it).

===Mid game===
====Objectives====
Raising your [[Luck]] and maintaining it should be a priority. Finish the Mines and Sokoban when you feel ready.

The [[Wizard quest]] is fairly easy, the [[Dark One]] is a pushover, and the reward&mdash;[[the Eye of the Aethiopica]]&mdash;is so fantastically useful that a Wizard should probably go on the quest as soon as possible. One of the many things the Eye does is vastly enhance strategic mobility through the Mazes of Menace&mdash;in particular, you can get out of trouble in an instant. Many Wizards set up a base camp in [[Sokoban]] and leave most of their worldly possessions there, going back whenever they need to read a spellbook or pick up more food. Adjacent monsters may follow you through the Eye's magical portal, but this also has its uses, such as luring [[wraith]]s out of a [[graveyard]] level.

If you have found the quest portal, but are not yet level 14, be aware that the first level of the quest, the Lonely Tower, is often well-provided with wraiths. You may be able to gain a few levels and reach XL 14 before you meet your quest leader.

For Wizards with the Eye and the magic missile and create monster spells, [[Farming#Altar scumming|altar farming]] is incredibly easy, since an arbitrary number of corpses for sacrifice can be created on demand. This is good for increasing your Luck or obtaining more sacrifice gifts and favors. If you decide to get [[crowned]], you will receive a [[spellbook of finger of death]].

====Weapons====
You can and should train daggers to Expert skill. Although Wizards don't get the [[multishot]] bonus at Skilled as of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], throwing two daggers in a single turn is still powerful, so it is recommended to acquire a good number of daggers that stack together. [[Elven dagger]]s are especially useful.

Acquire Magicbane at this stage, unless you have some reason not to.

====Spellcasting====
If you have come across a [[magic marker]], you can blank other spellbooks and write useful ones like {{spell of|magic missile}}, {{spell of|identify}}, or {{spell of|polymorph}}.

Since so many monsters are resistant to one or more forms of magical attack, you will need to build a diverse toolkit. A fire-resistant opponent may be especially vulnerable to cold attacks; an opponent with [[reflection]] can probably be brought down by splash effects from a {{spell of|fireball}}. Reading the wiki entries for new opponents to learn their immunities and weaknesses is a good idea. Ultimately, nothing has "stab resistance"&mdash;even [[shade]]s will succumb to an enchanted or silver weapon&mdash;so a Wizard should always have a good physical combat option to fall back on. Still, spells are generally the most powerful means of attack by this point in the game.

===Late game===
====Objectives====
Some players prefer to raise their experience level as high as possible in order to have the largest maximum HP and energy, and to maximize damage from casting magic missile. A level 30 Wizard gets 16d6 damage with each magic missile. Luring wraiths out of the Valley of the Dead and other graveyards will probably be required to reach this level. Remember to buy all the [[divine protection]] you want before trying to level up.

Other players like to keep their experience level low, to keep higher-difficulty monsters from being generated. Ultimately, the choice is up to you.

====Weapons====
Magicbane remains an excellent weapon. With its magic resistance and ability to catch curses, you can fight powerful spellcasters like [[arch-liches]] head-on. Opinions vary as to whether you should enchant it to +7 or keep it at +2; see [[Magicbane#Enchanting]] for details.

Other weapons such as [[Frost Brand]], [[Stormbringer]], or the [[Staff of Aesculapius]] are good options that do significantly more damage than Magicbane. Note the Staff of Aesculapius will not deal double damage to major [[demons]] or [[undead]], so if it is your weapon of choice you will want to be sure to have [[Cone of cold]] (and [[Fireball]] if you haven't genocided [[lich]]es) or at the very least a high-level [[Magic Missile]] to handle these enemies in [[Gehennom]].

====Spellcasting====
You should definitely have the {{spell of|finger of death}} spell in your repertoire by now. Save charges on your wands of death for when you really need them; e.g. when facing the [[Riders]] on the Astral Plane.

The [[helm of brilliance]] while not necessary, can be useful for reducing spell failure rates of difficult spells, or giving less capable wizards the benefit of [[hungerless casting]].

Getting a source of [[confusion]] for the Planes should be easy, since you probably have at least one useless forgotten spell like {{spell of|cure blindness}} or {{spell of|restore ability}}.

Casting spells when you have the [[Amulet of Yendor]] can drain your power very fast. You can drop it on the ground when you need to cast a lot of spells without moving. Also, consider stocking up on a few [[scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]] and reading them when confused to restore all your energy immediately.

==Rank titles==

The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1–2: Evoker
*XL 3–5: Conjurer
*XL 6–9: Thaumaturge
*XL 10–13: Magician
*XL 14–17: Enchanter/Enchantress
*XL 18–21: Sorcerer/Sorceress
*XL 22–25: Necromancer
*XL 26–29: Wizard
*XL 30: Mage

==Quest==
{{main|Wizard quest}}

The Wizard quest sees you fighting the [[Dark One]] for [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]].

==Variants==

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Wizards start with four spellbooks, with one book chosen randomly from each of:
* {{spellbook of|force bolt|or=1|sleep}}
* {{spellbook of|resist poison|or=1|resist sleep}}
* {{spellbook of|detect food|detect monsters|light|knock|or=1|wizard lock}}
* {{spellbook of|magic missile|confuse monster|slow monster|cure blindness|endure heat}}, {{spellbook of|endure cold|insulate|create monster|or=1|healing}}

SLASH'EM adds the rank titles Warlock/Witch (XL 14–17), bumps Enchanter/Enchantress to XL 18–21, Sorcerer/Sorceress to XL 22–25, and removes the rank title of Necromancer (presumably, to avoid confusion with the new [[Necromancer]] role).

====Strategy====

Wizards in SLASH'EM are a bit more difficult then in vanilla. In vanilla, once you get [[Magicbane]] you are likely to be on the road to ascension. Here, you had better stay sharp even after you get Magicbane. Keep your pet around you for longer. A good advice would be to stay careful and keep your pet until your AC is below &minus;10 and your level is above 10.

An additional difficulty is that you don't have enough slots for all the extrinsics you would want. [[Dragon scale mail]] interferes with spellcasting now and generally isn't worth having in your [[ascension kit]]. In addition, you have to deal with the [[create pool]] spell and more serious [[level drain]] attacks.

Some possible equipment choices:

*[[Water walking boots]]: You need these to deal with [[create pool]] spells. You can use {{spell of|haste self}} as a substitute to [[speed boots]]. The amulet slot is already crowded for other things, so no [[amulet of flying]] for you.
*[[Ring of levitation]] with [[speed boots]]: With the ring, you are vulnerable to [[electric bug]]s. If you use this, you might want to blessed-genocide <code>x</code> to be safe, and this is no joke. The {{spell of|levitation}} spell is dangerously unreliable (unless Skilled or better in escape spells).
*[[Robe of protection]]: The highest natural AC for the body armor slot without spellcasting interference. It can be [[upgrade]]d from plain [[Robe (SLASH'EM)|robe]]s with 50% chance. The [[robe of power]] is useless for a Wizard, unless you are wearing metallic armor. Robes take the body armor slot here, so you can't attempt to wear a [[robe of power]] on top of dragon scale mail.
*Amulet of {{amulet of|reflection|or=1|drain resistance}}: You'll need to give up on the amulet of {{amulet of|flying|and=1|life saving}}.
*Wielding the [[hand of Vecna]]: It confers [[drain resistance]]. You can rely on the {{spell of|remove curse}} spell for the curses. Be careful of the blast if you are neutral.
*Wielding [[Stormbringer]] if chaotic for [[drain resistance]]. You can obtain Stormbringer easily by [[crowning]] <em>while carrying</em> a [[spellbook of finger of death]]; this will also unrestrict broadsword skill. Without already carrying finger of death spellbook, you'll get that instead.
*Wielding [[Nighthorn]]: It confers reflection, but it is two-handed, so if it gets cursed, you can't cast spells anymore. Also, being lawful, it will blast you for sure.
*Depending on your situation, you could forgo reflection or drain resistance, but this is risky.

Bad ideas:

*Wielding [[the Staff of Aesculapius]]: It doesn't confer drain resistance in SLASH'EM. Because it is two-handed, you can't cast spells if it gets cursed.
* Wearing a [[shield of reflection]]: Your success rate will not be higher than 55% for {{spell of|magic missile}} and 25% for anything else.

Nice wishes:

[[The wallet of Perseus]] (unaligned) can help overcome the initial low carrying capacity of the Wizard, without wearing [[gauntlets of power]].

===SporkHack===
In [[SporkHack]], Wizards start with a [[spellbook of protection]] and a [[cloak of protection]] instead of a cloak of magic resistance.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], energy regeneration is increased by 0.33 per turn if the player is a Wizard. They start with four spellbooks ({{spellbook of|force bolt|magic missile}}, and two random ones), but no potions, scrolls, rings, or wand.

===FIQHack===

In [[FIQHack]], Wizards no longer get scrolls, potions, or rings as starting inventory. The only starting wand is the [[wand of striking]]. However, Wizards also start with 4 spells (force bolt, magic missile, and 2 random).

Similar to xNetHack, energy regeneration is increased by 0.33 per turn for Wizards.

[[Hungerless casting]] no longer exists.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.

&&%s&& %s Water {134536 2020-06-25T23:52:25Z {4000693 Phol ende wodan} update; move a sentence to a more logical place; a rust trap can wet any wielded object '''Water''' comes in several forms:
* as a [[potion of water]]
* in a [[fountain]]
* in a [[sink]]
* in a [[pool]] or [[moat]]
* in a [[rust trap]], which somehow affects only worn armor and wielded objects
* on the [[Plane of Water]]

Some [[monster]]s are made of water, for example:
* [[water elemental]]
* [[water troll]]
* [[water demon]]

Water is that clear liquid that you probably know from real life. In ''[[NetHack]]'', water can [[rust]] objects or [[drown]] you, [[wet|among other things]]. In a [[fountain]] or as a potion of [[holy water]] or [[unholy water]], water has more [[magic]]al effects. In a sink, water can have bizarre effects; for example, it might mutate ([[polymorph]]) you when you drink it. The watery monsters don't actually tend to cause water damage.

{{disambig}}
{{nethack-366}}}
&&%s&& %s Wet {126327 2019-07-22T01:44:53Z {4001313 Ardub23} Improvements to wording Several things can happen if an [[object]] becomes '''wet'''. The most common effects are to [[rust]] metal and make [[blank scroll]]s and [[blank spellbook]]s. The normal way to make an object wet is to dip it into water, usually a [[pool]] or [[moat]], or to submerge yourself while carrying the object. [[Rust trap]]s can also wet worn or wielded rustable items, and wielded scrolls.

Note some special sources of water will ''not'' wet an object, but will have a different effect. #[[Dip]]ping into a [[pool]], [[moat]], or uncursed [[potion of water]] will always wet an object, but never the contents of containers. Dipping into a [[fountain]] will always wet an object and can give special effects, including converting a [[long sword]] into [[Excalibur]]. Dipping into [[holy water]] or [[unholy water]] will ''never'' wet an object.

== Effects ==
The effect is determined by the functions {{function|potion.c|get_wet}} and {{function|trap.c|water_damage}}. They have slightly different effects. When an object becomes wet, the following happens:

* Contents of containers are affected only if you fall into water, not if #dipped.
* Nothing happens to an object protected by [[grease]], except that the grease might wash off (50% chance).
* A [[potion of acid]] will explode. Harmless if you fell into water, but it will deal d10 damage if #dipped ("killed by elementary chemistry").
* Other potions will become diluted. Already-diluted potions will become uncursed water. (This means that any non-acid potion can be dipped twice to make uncursed water, which can later be turned into [[holy water]].)
* [[Scroll]]s and [[spellbook]]s become blank; if you have a [[magic marker]], you can then write new ones. The resulting blank objects will have the same BUC status as the original. The [[Book of the Dead]] cannot become blank. ("The Book of the Dead suddenly heats up; steam rises and it remains dry.") A [[scroll of mail]] also cannot be blanked; this prevents you from sending yourself mail to supply yourself with blank scrolls.
* [[Iron]] objects might (50%) become one step more [[rust]]y. [[Rustproof]] objects and objects which are already "thoroughly rusty" will not rust. Other metals do not rust.

If you dipped into an uncursed [[potion of water]], and one of the above effects occurs, the water is consumed; otherwise you keep it ("''Object'' gets wet."). You keep your potion if the dipped object was greased. It's a waste to use uncursed water this way; it is better to dip uncursed potions of water into [[holy water]] to make more holy water. If you want to manufacture uncursed potions of water or blank paper, do not dip into potions of water; dip into a [[pool]], a [[moat]], or (less preferrably) a [[fountain]], or [[Cancellation|cancel]] the items. Dipping a container will not dilute any potions inside it.

== Strategy ==
The safest technique for dipping is to wear [[water walking boots]] or be [[flying]] ([[levitation]] will not work), walk over open water that is devoid of [[sea monster]]s, and dip away. This is not always an option, so second to this is to drop any inventory item you don't want to get wet, ensure that you're [[Encumbrance|unencumbered]], and walk into open water. You will escape the water unharmed and have any scrolls in your inventory blanked and potions diluted. Be careful! This also happens to items in a [[bag]], unless it is oilskin or has been temporarily protected with grease. With high [[Luck]], you might need to try several times. Swimming is safe because you can only drown if you are encumbered from your armor or loadstone, or if monsters block all adjacent land squares. Another slow, but somewhat safer method is to remove any rustprone worn items, wield the item you want wetted, and repeatedly #[[sit]] on a rust trap. This does not work for potions or spellbooks.

Fountains are the most readily available means of dipping objects; however, they can be quite dangerous for unprepared characters and will dry up rather soon. Dipping in a fountain may [[curse]] the dipped item, or it may summon [[water demon]]s, [[water moccasin]]s, and [[water nymph]]s. Unless you have decent [[AC]] (around 0 is a good baseline), [[poison resistance]] and/or [[magic cancellation]], a decent weapon, and a way to [[curse removal|remove curses]], it is better to find another means.

If necessary, you can create pools of water by digging down on a [[fountain]], or twice on a [[sink]]. It is recommended you create pools near your main stash for unlimited, no-side-effects water.

&&%s&& %s Potion of holy water {145176 2022-03-28T02:29:49Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Description */ {{potion
 |color=cyan
 |tile=[[Image:Clear potion.png]]
 |name=holy water
 |appearance=blessed clear potion
 |cost=100
}}
The '''potion of holy water''' is a [[blessed]] [[potion of water]], and appears as a "blessed clear potion" when unidentified.

==Generation==
All [[Priest|Priest(esse)s]] start the game with 4 potions of holy water, and [[Wizard]]s have a chance of starting the game with holy water as one of their random potions.

In addition to random generation, Shops sell holy water in 14.4% of all non-[[Tourist]] dungeons. 

A [[horn of plenty]] may occasionally produce a potion of water when [[applied]], which will also be blessed if the horn is blessed.

==Description==
[[Quaff]]ing a potion of holy water cures [[lycanthropy]] and, for non-[[chaotic]]s, cures all [[illness]]es; chaotics will take 2d6 damage instead of having illnesses cured.

You can #[[dip]] an [[object]] (or stack of objects) into holy water to uncurse or bless them, using up one potion of holy water; objects dipped into holy water do not become [[wet]]. A cursed object will be uncursed, while an uncursed object will be blessed; dipping a blessed object into holy water will simply produce an "Interesting..." message, and the potion is not consumed.

Inhaling vapors from a potion of holy water reverts you to human form if you have lycanthropy, but does not cure it; monsters hit with [[throw]]n or [[wield]]ed potion of holy water take 2d6 damage if they are a [[demon]], [[undead]], or lycanthrope, and lycanthropes are additionally shifted to their human form.

==Strategy==
Holy water is one of the many methods of [[curse removal]] ''and'' one of the few means of blessing objects, so it is considered essential for almost any player to have. When blessing and/or uncursing objects, always be sure to #[[adjust]] them into a single stack first. If necessary, use #[[name]] to remove names from any named objects so that you can stack them for dipping.

===Blessing and uncursing items===
From the mid-game on&mdash;especially if you are frequently using [[two-handed]] weapons&mdash;consider keeping holy water and other forms of [[curse removal]] in small caches on the current level, or other levels, that you can easily access. If wielding a cursed two-handed weapon, you can retreat to a cache in order to get it uncursed. You can also dedicate a separate container, such as a [[sack]], to holding holy water and other curse-removing items; as of [[3.6.0]], you can #[[tip]] containers, allowing you to get holy water in order to uncurse the two-handed weapon.

Even once your primary tools and kit are blessed, you will benefit from keeping a few potions of holy water on hand, often to bless any useful items found later on, and especially to deal with [[curse items|curse-slinging]] [[monster spell|spellcasters]]. Even for items that would display little to no real difference in function (such as most [[armor]]), blessing them can still offer vital protection&mdash;blessed objects targeted by a cursing effect will only become uncursed.

===Identification===
In [[shop]]s, holy water can be easily [[Price ID|identified]] since uncursed potions of water have a base price of 0, and holy/unholy water has a base price of 100; a [[pet]] can easily reveal the beatitude of a 100zm clear potion.

Dip-testing can be used to informally identify the BUC of water, and is best done after [[pet testing]] for any unholy water. Use a blessed, non-[[iron]] item to do so - holy water will only produce a message without consuming the potion, while uncursed water will wet the item without consuming it (which also rusts iron objects). In theory, potions can be dipped to test if they are blessed before quaffing them, but this risks diluting the potion(s) and using up the water in the process; this is also not practical for testing if other unidentified items are blessed, as such a blessed item is usually discovered this way by accident.

===Obtaining water===
There are multiple other ways to obtain or produce holy water, each of which require other potions of water on hand, and all are discussed in the sections below. Potions of water can be created by some of the following methods:

* #[[Dip]]ping another potion(s) into a [[fountain]] or [[moat|body of water]] twice will first dilute it, and then convert it to an uncursed bottle of water regardless of its original BUC.
** Dropping potions in your inventory into a pool of water or walking into one with potions in your inventory works the same way, though both actions are much riskier. You will need a way to retrieve the potions afterward or a way to prevent water damage to the rest of your inventory.
* [[Cancel]]ling will turn many potions into uncursed water; some other potions, such as [[potion of sickness|potions of sickness]] [[potion of booze|and booze]], will instead become [[fruit juice]]. See that article for more details.
* Dipping a [[unicorn horn]] into a [[potion of blindness]], [[potion of confusion|confusion]], or [[potion of hallucination|hallucination]] will turn them into potions of water.

====Prayer and altars====
By standing on a co-aligned [[altar]], placing nonblessed potions of water on it and #[[pray]]ing (while it is safe to do so), all of those potions will be blessed in addition to the regular results of a successful prayer; doing this at a cross-aligned altar will create unholy water instead and [[anger]] your god. While prayer is not always readily available, praying to make holy water has the benefit of immediately blessing unholy water without using up other resources.

====Dipping into holy water====
If you have at least one potion of holy water, you can #adjust all your uncursed potions of water into a single stack, then dip them into the holy water to bless the entire stack. This can be used to produce holy water more quickly and reliably than prayer, especially for a [[crowned]] player, at the slight cost of using up one of the potions; unholy water takes two such dips to unbless, and prayer is preferable for converting unholy water that you do not plan to use later.

====Confused scrolls of remove curse====
Reading a blessed [[scroll of remove curse]] while confused has a chance of either blessing or cursing each uncursed item or stack of items in your main inventory. Each has an independently calculated chance of either being blessed (25%), cursed (25%), or left alone (50%); additionally, all uncursed items will lose formal BUC identification. For example, if you are carrying 10 non-stacked uncursed potions of water, reading a blessed [[scroll of remove curse]] while confused gives you a 94.3% chance of holy water.

This method is often used to create both holy and unholy water, and requires the player to drop and/or stash their uncursed inventory, including any [[armor]], [[weapons]], [[jewelry]] or leashes. Once done, you can use the #adjust command to stack each of the potions and re-identify their beatitude by using an altar, [[pet testing]] them and/or dip-testing using a blessed non-iron object as mentioned above. For [[atheist]]s, this is one of the most reliable ways to obtain holy water and bless other items; using an altar in anyway will break the conduct.

===Conserving holy water===
Which items 'deserve' blessing the most depends heavily on the player and their approach; there are still certain items that serve a ubiquitous purpose, sometimes to the point of frequently appearing in [[ascension kit]]s. It is often very important to establish what items you will bless ahead of time in order to conserve the amount of holy water used. The following items are among the most common targets for blessing:

* A blessed [[bag of holding]] will divide the effective weight of its contents by four, comparing to an uncursed bag halving its contents' weight; this confers a great advantage in how much you can carry, lifting upwards of 200 units of weight off your back.
* A blessed [[scroll of charging]] gives a recharged item more charges on average than an uncursed scroll, and thus has a better chance of restoring it to its maximum capacity of uses. This is most useful for saving a "2 blessed scrolls of charging" [[wish]] from a [[wand of wishing]].
* If you use [[ranged weapon]]s, which have a chance of disappearing, blessing them drastically lowers the chances they will do so.
* A blessed [[horn of plenty]] will produce blessed food and potions, useful for [[foodless]] conduct.
* A blessed [[scroll of identify]] will usually identify more than one item, sometimes even your entire inventory.
* A blessed [[potion of gain level]] advances your level and puts you part way to the next level, while an uncursed one only advances you to the bottom of the next level.  Early on, this can be quite useful.  Later, the XP requirements for advancing a level become so steep it doesn't help much, as advancing a level naturally would still require considerable farming.
* A blessed [[scroll of genocide]] will wipe out an entire [[monster class]] as opposed to only one species. The more monsters in the class, and the more dangerous they are, the better; [[Lich]]es are an especially common target.

This is an exhaustive list of ways to make holy water; 53% of all games randomly generate holy water in the [[Mines]] or the [[Dungeons of Doom|main dungeons]] down to [[Medusa's Island]].

==History==
All potions of water were introduced in [[NetHack 1.3d]].

==Messages==
{{message|You feel full of awe.|You quaffed a potion of holy water, and are lawful or neutral.}}
{{message|This burns like acid!|As above, but you are chaotic.}}
{{message|<[[foo]]> glows amber.|You dipped a cursed object into a potion of holy water, and it is now uncursed.}}
{{message|<[[foo]]> glows light blue.|You dipped an uncursed object into a potion of holy water, and it is now blessed.}}

After receiving any of the above message, you will be prompted to type-name the potion if you had not already identified it.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Holy water}}
The religion-related functions of holy water, and the fact that Priests start the game with some, are derived from the religious practices of water being blessed by a member of the clergy or other significant figure (or conversely, derived from a well or spring that considered holy). Said water is typically used for cleansing prior to baptism and spiritual cleansing in several religions, from Christianity to Sikhism; the use of holy water as a sacramental for protection against evil is common among Lutherans, Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and Eastern Christians.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], there are additional methods to obtain holy water:

* The [[potion of amnesia]] dilutes into a potion of water immediately when dipped into any water source. Unlike normal dipping, this does not change the beatitude, and can be used to create (un)holy water.
* Some shops offer an uncursing service with a base price of 150 zorkmids before modifiers. If you are [[hallucinating]], there is a 1/4 chance the [[shopkeeper]] will be distracted and accidentally bless the item. This is best done with an on-demand source of hallucination (e.g. the potion or tins of [[yellow mold]] or [[violet fungus]]), a good deal of credit with the shopkeeper, an engraved or burnt [[Elbereth]] to avoid accidents, and a unicorn horn to cure the hallucination after. Remember that hallucination in [[SLASH'EM]] also messes with viewing your inventory 0 don't forget the inventory letter for your potions of water.
* Occasionally upon [[sacrifice]] at an [[altar]], your god will bless the object in your primary or off-hand. This can be used with wielded potions of water; press {{kbd|x}} to swap them, and sacrifice until they become holy.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], you can also use shopkeeper services in the same way as SLASH'EM to create holy water. Additionally, a [[Binder]] that binds [[User:Chris/dNetHack/dNethack Roles/Binder/Marionette|Marionette]] is forbidden from drinking holy water.

[[User:Chris/dNetHack/Windowless Tower|The Windowless Tower]] has a niche with four potions of holy water on its second floor.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], [[player monster]] [[Priest (player monster)|priests]] and (less commonly) [[Wizard (player monster)|wizards]] can be encountered carrying holy water.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
"We want a word with you," said Ligur (in a tone of voice
intended to imply that "word" was synonymous with "horrifically
painful eternity"), and the squat demon pushed open the office
door.
The bucket teetered, then fell neatly on Ligur's head.
Drop a lump of sodium in water.  Watch it flame and burn and
spin around crazily, flaring and sputtering.  This was like
that, just nastier.
The demon peeled and flared and flickered.  Oily brown smoke
oozed from it, and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed.
Then it crumpled, folded in on itself, and what was left lay
glistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet, looking
like a handful of mashed slugs.
"Hi," said Crowley to Hastur, who had been walking behind Ligur,
and had unfortunately not been so much as splashed.
There are some things that are unthinkable; there are some
depths that not even demons would believe other demons would
stoop to.
". . . Holy water.  You bastard," said Hastur.  "You complete
_bastard_.  He hadn't never done nothing to _you_."
"Yet," corrected Crowley.

A '''potion of unholy water''' (unidentified, a "cursed clear potion" if BUC is known) is the [[cursed]] version of the [[potion of water]].

== Effect ==

Unholy water has the inverse effect of [[holy water]]:

* Dip a [[blessed]] object into unholy water to make it [[uncursed]].
* Dip an [[uncursed]] object into unholy water to make it [[cursed]].
* Dip a [[cursed]] object into unholy water, and you get message "Interesting..."; the potion is not consumed.

Thus, using the #[[dip]] command together with unholy water allows you to make [[cursed]] objects.

[[Quaff]]ing a potion of unholy water will polymorph you into your wereform if you have [[lycanthropy]].  Additionally, chaotic characters (or ones polymorphed into a [[demon]] or [[undead]]) heal 2d6 HP and [[exercise]] constitution, lawful characters take 2d6 damage instead, and neutral characters just [[abuse]] their constitution.

Potions of unholy water cannot be diluted (and therefore made uncursed) by dipping them in a [[fountain]] or [[moat]]. Other methods of uncursing items ([[cancellation]], [[scroll of remove curse]], etc.) will still work.

== Obtaining unholy water ==
One way is to grab it from a [[bones]] pile: it is likely that water dropped from a previous player will be cursed, and thus unholy. Bones containing dead [[priest|priest(esse)s]] are especially good sources, as their starting potions of holy water might have become unholy.

With that first potion, it is easy to make more unholy water by dipping a stack of a few uncursed [[potion of water|potions of water]] into unholy water.

The safest way is to read a blessed [[scroll of remove curse]] while confused, which has a 25% chance of either blessing or cursing the uncursed items in your inventory, and hope that this curses some potions of water. To avoid accidentally cursing useful items, either drop all uncursed items you do not wish to make cursed or read a second blessed scroll of remove curse after dropping all unholy water. To increase your chances of getting unholy water, have many potions of water and individual-name each one with a different name so that they don't stack. This method has the added benefit of potentially created holy water, which is also useful.

Another method is to [[dip]] a BUC-identified potion into a [[fountain]] repeatedly. There is a chance that the (resulting) potion of water will get cursed. You don't get a message, so check it after each dip. Be prepared for the monsters this can summon.

[[Pray]]ing at an [[altar]] not of your alignment outside Gehennom with [[potion of water|potions of water]] on the altar will make unholy water, but this will [[anger]] your god with the usual consequences (at a minimum, losing any "purchased" divine protections). You can offset the anger point in a number of ways, such as by sacrificing a former pet on the cross-aligned altar (this neither converts the altar nor consumes the corpse nor angers a tending priest, but has its own disadvantages), but you will still have suffered the loss of any divine protection in addition to the harmful effects of being smitten.

Yet another way is to [[wish]] for cursed potions of water.

== Strategy ==

In general, unholy water is only useful for making cursed objects. An exception might be for intentionally healing a [[demon]], [[undead]], or [[lycanthrope]], such as a [[pet]], or a [[chaotic]] [[player]]. Although the vast majority of objects in the game are better when they are not cursed, there are some exceptions to this rule, and it is these exceptions that are of interest here.

* Cursed [[scroll of teleportation|scrolls of teleportation]] allow a player to [[level teleport]], which is often more useful than normal teleportation. Confused non-cursed scrolls also provide this, but confusion will likely negate the effect of [[teleport control]] unless you have high [[Luck]].
* Cursed [[scroll of genocide|scrolls of genocide]] allow a player to summon a number of monsters of his/her choice, which is occasionally useful (see [[reverse genocide]]).
* Cursed [[scroll of destroy armor|scrolls of destroy armor]] can produce [[fooproof]] armor when read while confused.
* Cursed [[scroll of gold detection|scrolls of gold detection]] can detect traps or magic portals. Note that you can also get this effect from confused non-cursed gold detection, and the traps will not show up as gold.
* Cursed [[scroll of enchant armor|scrolls of enchant armor]] or [[scroll of enchant weapon|scrolls of enchant weapon]] can lower the enchantment level of armor or weapons. This is occasionally useful if you want to (for example) raise a weapon's enchantment from +6 to +7, since the only safe way to do so requires first lowering the enchantment to +5. However, in most cases the best way to lower enchantments is to use #[[engrave|engraving]] or [[drain life (spell)|drain life]].
* Cursed [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]] allow you to ascend dungeon levels.
* Cursed [[potion of acid|potions of acid]] do more damage when [[throw]]n.
* Cursed [[scroll of create monster|scrolls of create monster]] will create many more monsters (or acid blobs), useful for sacrifice.
* Cursed [[scroll of confuse monster|scrolls of confuse monster]] will confuse [[you]]. Combined with a non-cursed [[scroll of gold detection]], this is the safest way to detect the [[endgame]] [[portal]]s.
* Pets will not pick up cursed items and will avoid walking over squares containing cursed items. A stack of darts, arrows, or rocks can be cursed and used to activate many [[Elbereth]] squares without the risk of a pet picking up the item or smudging the engraving. This can also be used to temporarily block your pet from entering an area, e.g. out of Sokoban pits, or to protect a shopkeeper or priest from a strong pet. If only a single square needs to be blocked off then the potion of unholy water itself can be used.
** Note that pets will sometimes move "reluctantly" over cursed items anyway. Worse, if some [[Diet#Pets|suitable food]] happens to appear in the same square of those cursed objects, pets will make a beeline for them, disregarding any cursed objects on those squares. Therefore, if cursed objects are to be used for blockading it may be best to drop multiple cursed objects in such a manner that a pet must pass through multiple cursed item squares to get past the blockade. 
* A cursed [[unicorn horn]] is an unlimited (albeit dangerous) source of [[confusion]] for illiterates and polyselfless speed runners. Forgotten spells are better for everyone else.
* The cursed [[Book of the Dead]] can level up pet purple worms [[Farming#Wraith_farming|pretty fast]].

==Messages==

{{message|This burns like acid!|You quaffed a potion of unholy water, and are lawful.}}
{{message|You feel full of dread.|You quaffed a potion of unholy water, and are neutral.}}
{{message|You feel quite proud of yourself.|You quaffed a potion of unholy water, and are chaotic.}}

After receiving any of these messages, you will be prompted to type-name the potion if you had not identified it already.

==SLASH'EM==

In [[SLASH'EM]], there is an additional way of obtaining unholy water, with [[shopkeeper services]]. While [[Confusion|confused]], use the uncursing service on a [[potion of water]]. "You accidentally ask for the item to be cursed!" and the shopkeeper will curse your potion of water.

Also, damage and healing from drinking the potion is increased to 6d6, making unholy water about as effective as [[potion of healing]] if you're chaotic.

{{for|ways to change your alignment rating|alignment record}}
'''Alignment''' in ''[[NetHack]]'' is a trichotomy: '''lawful''', '''neutral''' or '''chaotic'''. The following things have an alignment:

* [[Monster]]s
* [[Altar]]s
* [[Quest artifact]]s
* [[Artifact weapon]]s
* [[Dungeon branch]]es
* Your [[Player|character]]

In addition to your character's alignment (whether you are lawful, neutral, or chaotic), your character also has an ''[[alignment record]]'', a number referred to as <tt>u.ualign.record</tt> in the [[source code]]. Some spoilers refer to this number as your "alignment", creating ambiguity.

Altars to the evil god [[Moloch]] are considered '''unaligned'''&mdash;that is, not lawful, neutral or chaotic. Additionally, some artifact weapons are non-aligned; this only means that they express no preference for the alignment of their wielders, not that they are in some way allied to Moloch.

The interactions between objects of different alignments are many and varied. Two things are '''"co-aligned"''' when their alignments are the same, or '''"cross-aligned"''' when they are different.

==Your alignment==

[[You]] choose your alignment during character creation. If you choose any race except [[human (starting race)|human]], your alignment is assigned implicitly: [[dwarf (starting race)|dwarves]] are lawful, [[Gnome (starting race)|gnomes]] are neutral, and [[elf (starting race)|elves]] and [[orc (starting race)|orcs]] are chaotic. Humans may explicitly choose their alignment, although most roles have restrictions on permissible alignments. For example, [[Barbarian]]s cannot be lawful, [[Cavemen]] cannot be chaotic, and [[Knight]]s must be lawful.

There are two ways to change your character's alignment. Wearing a [[helm of opposite alignment]] changes your alignment temporarily, and sacrificing at a cross-aligned [[altar]] under certain circumstances can convert your alignment permanently. If you permanently change your alignment before doing your [[quest]], however, the game will be [[unwinnable]].

===Lawful===
{| border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" style="width: 100%;"
|width="50%" valign="top"|
====Lawful advantages====
* Easy access to [[Excalibur]]: dip a long sword into a fountain after you reach experience level 5. This does ''not'' unrestrict long sword [[skill]], but see below.
* You may receive [[Grayswandir]], the coveted [[artifact]] silver saber, as a [[sacrifice gift]].
** If you don't receive Grayswandir and your role doesn't have a guaranteed first sacrifice gift, you will receive some sort of long sword. This unrestricts your long sword skill, allowing any lawful [[role]] to competently wield Excalibur.
* The [[Gnomish Mines]] will have more peaceful monsters, so that branch is easier.
* White [[unicorn]]s are slightly more common than other colors to compensate for [[Gehennom]] preventing lawful monsters generating within, making it easier to gain [[Luck]] early on.
* Some nasty monsters - such as [[titan]]s, [[golden naga]]s, and especially [[Archon]]s - are co-aligned and will most often be peaceful.
* You can reliably use a [[helm of opposite alignment]] on the chaotic high altar.
|valign="top"|

====Lawful disadvantages====
* The [[mysterious force]] is harsher.
* Because more unicorns will be coaligned, you may have more difficulty obtaining a [[unicorn horn]].
* Other than Grayswandir, lawful sacrifice gifts are lacking in general-purpose damage.
* You lose [[intrinsic]] [[telepathy]] and two points of [[Luck]] if you commit [[murder]].
* You get a &minus;1 alignment penalty for directly [[stealing from shops]].
* You get a &minus;1 alignment penalty from using [[poison]]ed weapons. ("You feel like an evil coward for using a poisoned weapon.")
* You cannot ascend on the neutral high altar.
* Your [[crowning]] gift can neither [[drain life]] nor [[instakill]] enemies, and is thus weak against [[covetous]] monsters.
|}

===Neutral===
{| border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" style="width: 100%;"
|width="50%" valign="top"|
====Neutral advantages====
* You have a wide selection of [[quest artifact]]s available by [[wish]]ing. [[The Eyes of the Overworld]] and [[the Eye of the Aethiopica]] in particular grant effects available nowhere else.
* Neutral sacrifice gifts include the powerful [[Cleaver]] and [[Mjollnir]], and the useful utility weapon [[Magicbane]].
* [[Air elemental]]s, a very dangerous monster, may be generated peaceful.
* [[Domestic animals]] may be generated peaceful, so you can keep them alive and return to tame them when you need them.
|valign="top"|

====Neutral disadvantages====
* You lose [[intrinsic]] [[telepathy]] and two points of Luck if you commit [[murder]].
* Using a helm of opposite alignment to ascend on a different altar is not reliable, unless you test it first.
* Your [[crowning]] artifact does less damage than the other alignments' and does not provide [[drain resistance]].
* A large number of low-level always-hostile monsters are neutral, giving neutral characters no alignment record gains for killing them, which may be a problem for [[protection racket]] runs.
* Due to the nature of the formula used, neutral monsters which can randomly be generated peaceful have at most a 50% chance of being so.<ref>The formula uses the absolute value of monster alignment, which is at least one for lawful or chaotic monsters but always zero for neutral ones.</ref>
|}

===Chaotic===
{| border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" style="width: 100%;"
|width="50%" valign="top"|
====Chaotic advantages====
* There is no Luck or telepathy penalty for [[murder]]ing peaceful humans. You still lose alignment record, however.
* [[stealing from shops#Direct theft|Direct theft]] from a shop gives a +1 alignment bonus (''unless'' you are a [[Rogue]]).
* You decrease your [[prayer timeout]] more quickly by sacrificing.
* You can [[sacrifice]] your own race at [[altar]]s. When you do, your [[god]] dispatches a peaceful unique [[demon lord]] to the altar, making one less demon to fight in Gehennom. This may also summon a peaceful [[foocubus]].
* Sacrificing your own race on a cross-aligned altar will automatically convert that altar to chaotic.
* The mysterious force is more merciful.
* You can reliably use a [[helm of opposite alignment]] on the lawful high altar.
* The blessed [[Book of the Dead]] can tame [[undead]].
* If you are not a Rogue, you can wish for [[the Master Key of Thievery]].
|valign="top"|

====Chaotic disadvantages====
* [[anger|Angry]] chaotic gods are more difficult to mollify, demanding better sacrifices to reduce anger points.
* Chaotic sacrifice gifts are of very little general use, with the exception of [[Stormbringer]], which has a major (if surmountable) drawback. The other chaotic quest artifact, [[the Longbow of Diana]], is rarely worth wishing for.
* {{of|potion|Holy water}} will not cure your [[sickness]]. It does cure [[lycanthropy]], but you take damage when quaffing holy water.
* Most of the more dangerous chaotic monsters are always hostile, regardless of your alignment.
* You cannot ascend on the neutral high altar.
|}

==Monster alignment==

A monster's alignment is entirely different from the player character's alignment or alignment record, and is used primarily to determine whether it is peaceful or not toward you.{{reffunc|makemon.c|peace_minded}} Monsters can be lawful, neutral, or chaotic; the [[Wizard of Yendor]] and [[Aligned priest|priests of Moloch]] are unaligned.

Alignment is determined by the integer <tt>maligntyp</tt> of <tt>struct permonst</tt> declared in [[permonst.h]]; a positive integer is lawful, 0 is neutral, and a negative integer is chaotic. Thus, while monsters of the same type actually have the same alignment, some lawful monsters are more strongly lawful than others, for instance, while some chaotic monsters are more strongly so than other chaotic monsters. A neutral monster in this context is simply any monster that is neither lawful nor chaotic.

White [[unicorn]]s are lawful, gray ones are neutral, and black ones are chaotic. Unicorns are especially important, as your [[god]] expects you to respect co-aligned unicorns, and sacrificing cross-aligned ones is highly valued.

==Altar alignment==

Co-aligned altars can be used to [[pray]] and offer sacrifices to your god. Cross-aligned altars can be converted, but this is not always wise if there is an attendant priest.

==Artifact alignment==
