===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], the [[Bard quest]] places water walking boots on the same square as the [[quest nemesis]] [[Aglaope]] square at level creation.

Two [[artifact]] pairs of water walking boots are added:

* The [[Water Flowers]] are chaotic and grant [[displacement]] when worn, can be enchanted to +7, and can be invoked for hungerless [[teleport]]ing.
* The [[Frost Treads]] are unaligned and grant [[cold resistance]] while worn, add +1 to hit and +1d8 [[cold]] damage when kicking, and can freeze water and lava underfoot.

The Plane of Water is changed so that the "floor" of the air bubbles are also considered water as well, making it possible (and likely a good idea) to wear water walking boots there.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], monsters are capable of using worn water walking boots.

'''Jumping boots''' are [[boots]] allowing the wearer to [[jump]].

Some players prefer them to [[speed boots]] in an [[ascension kit]], as the common [[potion of speed]] can give temporary [[very fast]] speed. The boots are especially useful to those who ride a steed that is already quick (like [[warhorse]] or [[ki-rin]]) but also want the ability to jump.

Cursed jumping boots will still allow you to jump but cannot be unequipped and will likely carry an AC penalty.

In the diagram below, any of the squares marked {{brightblue|x}} can be jumped to with jumping boots.

Elven boots can be a useful source of stealth for the [[Sokoban]] zoo and other [[special room|special rooms]] that the player might encounter.

Elven boots, along with [[elven cloak]]s, are among the lightest and most common [[magical armor]], making them ideal for [[polypiling]],  even moreso due to their ability to be safely enchanted to +7.

'''Kicking boots''' are a pair of [[magical item|magical]] [[boots]] that appear in ''[[NetHack]]''. They are made of [[iron]], and have a [[randomized appearance]]; the default one associated with it is "a pair of buckled boots".{{refsrc|src/objects.c|522|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Description==
When worn, kicking boots add 5 to the maximum damage of [[kick]] attacks against non-[[thick-skinned]] monsters (for +2.5 average bonus damage) and give them a chance to make an enemy "reel", knocking them backwards. Kicking boots also increase the distance that kicked objects travel, and will guarantee success when kicking down [[door]]s.{{refsrc|src/dokick.c|49|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

==Strategy==
As armor, they can be a useful supplement for early-game adventurers, especially those lacking weapons (e.g., [[weaponless]] conduct, had them stolen by a [[nymph]], etc.), but outside of those scenarios they are usually superseded down the line by other boots such as [[speed boots]]. While they can be used to reliably reveal [[secret passage]]s and [[hidden door]]s, this can also be provided by a [[stethoscope]], [[searching]] aid or high [[Luck]].

Kicking boots may be [[identification|identified]] in several ways -- they are the only boots with a randomized appearance that weigh 50 [[aum]], and can be detected by an increase in the failure rate of spells or [[rub]]bing them on a [[touchstone]]. As they are usually the same price as [[elven boots]], [[price identification]] can also reveal kicking boots for characters that do not have intrinsic [[stealth]]. You can also test for them by kicking [[rock]]s or other junk objects - of note is that you may be able to move an otherwise-immobile [[loadstone]] while wearing kicking boots. If all else fails, repeatedly kicking open secret passages and (hidden) [[door]]s on the first try can signify worn kicking boots, although this is less reliable if you are a [[Monk]] or [[Samurai]].

==History==
Kicking boots were introduced in [[NetHack 3.3.0]]. Before that, they appeared in [[SLASH 6]], which was based on [[NetHack 3.1.3]].

In [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the weight of kicking boots was changed from 15 aum to 50.

'''Fumble boots''' are [[boots]] that cause [[fumbling]], making them quite undesirable to wear. Every 1d20 turns, you will be paralysed for 2 turns, and [[petrified]] if wielding a [[cockatrice corpse]]. A [[ring of free action]] does not counter this.{{refsrc|timeout.c|330}}

They have the same [[Price identification|price]] as [[levitation boots]], which are also usually generated [[cursed]]. The best way to distinguish them is by [[weight]]; levitation weighs 5 units less.

Wearing cursed fumble boots counts as [[minor trouble]].{{refsrc|pray.c|179}}

The '''levitation boots''' are a set of [[boots]] that appear in ''[[NetHack]]''.

== Generation ==
Levitation boots have a 90% chance of being generated [[cursed]].{{refsrc|mkobj.c|561}} 

The statue of [[Perseus]] on [[Medusa's Island]] has a chance to contain a +0 pair of levitation boots; the second '[[titan]]' variation gives it a 75% chance, while all other variants give it a 25% chance.{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|59|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|158|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|276|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|dat/medusa.des|376|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

==Effects==
While worn, the boots will cause you to constantly [[levitate]]; this levitation can only be ended by removing the boots, unless you gain a source of "levitation-at-will" that allows you to float to the floor on command.

== Strategy ==
Wearing cursed levitation boots prevents you from reaching the floor to grab items or travel down [[stairs]], and any [[fragile]] items you drop may break. Levitating over a [[sink]] removes any sources of levitation and causes you to crash to the ground; this can be useful for removing cursed levitation boots, but be sure that the damage does not kill you. Cursed levitation boots are also considered a major [[trouble]], so [[prayer]] is a viable solution for removal as well.

Levitation boots weigh the same as [[elven boots]] at 15 units (unlike most other boots with 20), although in practice it may be difficult to [[Identification#Weight identification|identify]] them in this way.

If you are not in need of [[very fast]] speed from [[speed boots]] at the time, then non-cursed levitation boots are great for crossing large bodies of water, such as in the [[Healer quest]] and Medusa's Island. A [[ring of levitation]] may be preferable to free up the boots slot for speed boots and maneuver more easily down stairs - levitation boots have an advantage in that [[shock]]ing attacks such as [[electric eel]] bites will not affect them.

That a small shield "doesn't provide much protection" really depends on enchantment, and 1 AC is not a huge difference. A '''shield''' is a form of [[armor]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is carried in the off-hand.

Wearing any shield increases spellcasting failure rates, although the penalty is lower for a [[small shield]].{{refsrc|src/spell.c|1802|nethack=3.6.6|comment=extra shield penalty doesn't apply for small shields}} When using a shield, you are unable to [[wield]] two-handed weapons or use the #[[twoweapon]] skill.

==Generation and usage==
[[Valkyries]] start with a +3 small shield, and [[Priests]] and [[Knights]] start with a +0 small shield.

Many humanoid monsters are generated with shields, and will pick up and use them; of specific note are [[Archon]]s, [[Angel]]s and [[Aleax]]es. All Archons are generated with a [[shield of reflection]], whereas Angels and Aleaxes have a 25% chance of having one.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|340|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Shields get in the way of two-weaponing and spellcasting, making them a poor choice for some late game characters. However, in the early and middle game a few extra points of armor class can be very beneficial. Even in the late game, there are some characters that only need to spellcast in situations where they can take off their shield. There are some [[role]]s that cannot two-weapon such as [[Cavemen]] and [[Ranger]]s. Additionally, some [[conduct]]s may make it difficult to find good armor. In these cases, there are three shields that are worth the weight.

The shield of reflection is often a candidate for [[ascension kit]]s, and is paired with a source of [[magic resistance]]. Reflection is a crucial property, but other sources of reflection would be preferable for most characters. The shield of reflection is also a good choice for pets that can equip a shield.

The small shield is a good choice for spellcasters and characters with low [[carrying capacity]].

The elven shield can be enchanted to +7 and is still lighter than most other shields, though it still penalizes spellcasting as a large shield.

The various other shields in the game are usually inferior choices because they are heavy and do not provide any special properties.

In addition to whatever magical effect they provide, riding boots give a bonus for [[saddle|saddling]] steeds, and snow boots give a bonus for walking on [[ice]].

== Identification ==

Speed boots, jumping boots and water walking boots have a base price of 50 zm; fumble boots and levitation boots have a base price of 30 zm; elven boots and kicking boots have a base price of 8 zm. (The most useful boots are also the most expensive ones.) Be aware, enchantment can confuse the issue.

Elven, levitation, and water walking boots weigh 15, kicking boots weigh 50, and the other randomized boots weigh 20. While this might be useful in some cases, it is somewhat tedious to attempt and cannot rule out the two pairs of boots which are likely to be cursed.

Do not wear boots without [[curse-testing]] them first. Cursed magic boots are very likely to be levitation boots or fumble boots, which have very annoying magical effects as well as possibly increasing your AC. You can still weight test, especially to distinguish levitation from fumble boots. 

Any boots you find in the [[statue of Perseus]] are guaranteed to be cursed levitation boots.

Speed boots and levitation boots will auto-identify when worn, except in the unusual case where you are already very fast or levitating. Elven boots will auto-identify when worn if you are not already [[stealth]]y (be aware that an [[elven cloak]] also grants stealth). You can deduce the appearance of elven boots by taking note of which boots are dropped by various [[elves (monster attribute)|elves]] throughout the dungeon.

Jumping boots can be identified by trying to jump (#jump command). [[Knight]]s must actually try to make an "illegal move" for a chess knight - any other role will get the message "You can't jump very far" unless they are wearing jumping boots.

Fumble boots can be identified by wearing them for a while and seeing whether you fumble, or by zapping a [[wand of enlightenment]] while wearing them.

Kicking boots are the only magic boots to be metallic, and can therefore be identified by wearing them and seeing whether your spell failure rates increase, or by testing for "scritch, scritch" by rubbing them on a [[touchstone]]. You will also always succeed in kicking down doors while wearing kicking boots, although [[monk]]s and [[samurai]] may find that difficult to test.

Water walking boots are tricky to identify, because walking on water to see whether you sink is dangerous! The danger can be reduced by dropping anything which is vulnerable to water damage (keep in mind that kicking boots tested in this way will rust). They can also be identified by zapping a [[wand of enlightenment]].
If you have some boots with a base price of 50 zm, and they grant neither speed nor jumping, then they must be water walking boots.

==SLASH'EM==

You may find steel boots in SLASH'EM. SLASH'EM uses steel boots as a randomized appearance for magical boots, in place of buckled boots. The actual identities of magical boots in SLASH'EM are all the same, just for some reason one of the randomized appearances is different. Steel boots are not actually metal, but rather are the appearance associated with kicking boots (which are metal) in the source code. That doesn't mean that steel boots will be kicking boots any more often than any other type of boot; it's just a thing in the source code.

==Encyclopaedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
In Fantasyland these are remarkable in that they seldom or
never wear out and are suitable for riding or walking in
without the need of Socks.  Boots never pinch, rub, or get
stones in them; nor do nails stick upwards into the feet from
the soles.  They are customarily mid-calf length or knee-high,
slip on and off easily and never smell of feet.  Unfortunately,
the formula for making this splendid footwear is a closely
guarded secret, possibly derived from nonhumans (see Dwarfs,
Elves, and Gnomes).

{{kbd|F}} is the explicit fight command. Its use is to attack [[peaceful]] monsters without confirmation, attack a [[pet]] without displacing it, or strike at the suspected location of an [[invisible]] monster without moving if it is not there.

Fighting at a space containing no monster produces the message "You attack thin air."

{{kbd|m}} is an explicit move command. If you want to attempt to move onto a space without attacking its occupant then press m before selecting your direction.

The two commands are generally associated with [[hallucination]], [[invisibility]] and [[blindness]], since these warrant more caution than the usual move-attack function. At most other times directional control is sufficient.

If you attempt to attack a peaceful creature (by trying to move onto the same square as it, not by using {{kbd|F}}) it will display a message saying "Really attack the (name of creature)? [yn] (n)".  It has "no" selected by default, but you can press {{kbd|y}} to attack the peaceful creature.

&&%s&& %s Paralysis {140682 2021-06-03T16:34:25Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* Prevention */ Even MC3 has a 10% failure rate... '''Paralysis''' is a magically-induced inability to move. Depending on the length and cause, paralysis can be quite dangerous, as monsters may get many free turns.

== Causes ==
*Attacking a [[floating eye]]. If you can see it and your hit does not kill it, there is a 2/3 chance that you will be paralyzed for a large number of turns (usually d70).{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|2405|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
*Attacking or being attacked by a [[gelatinous cube]]. This paralysis does not last as long.
*Being attacked by a [[shade]], [[ghoul]], [[guardian naga]] or [[Yeenoghu]]. This attack is affected by [[magic cancellation]].
*Being hit by a thrown or wielded [[potion of paralysis]]. This will paralyze you for 1-5 turns.
*Drinking a [[potion of paralysis]]. This will paralyze you for 13-46 turns depending on BUC.
*Being attacked by the [[monster spell #Clerical Spells|clerical spell]] [[Paralyze (monster spell)|paralyze]].
*Being hit by [[Magicbane]] (one of the random effects).

== Prevention ==
Wearing a [[ring of free action]] protects against all forms of paralysis ("You momentarily stiffen."). The paralyze monster spell can be limited to one turn by having [[magic resistance]].

You will likely encounter many thrown potions of paralysis throughout the game. In certain cases, such as when in crowded conditions on the [[Astral Plane]], getting paralyzed for five turns can be deadly. The danger is so great that some players will even wish for a ring of free action if they have not found one by the time they reach the Astral Plane. If you have one, you should definitely wear it for [[Moloch's Sanctum|the Sanctum]] and Astral Plane.

Most of the other causes of paralysis are easily preventable with good tactics. You can completely prevent paralysis from hitting floating eyes by not hitting them in melee unless you have [[reflection]]. Gelatinous cubes generally paralyze you for a short enough time as to not be dangerous unless you are in a crowd, but you can kill them with missile attacks if you're worried. Shade attacks are blocked by [[magic cancellation]], so wearing a good cloak will usually prevent them from being a hazard. Finally, don't quaff unidentified potions that might be paralysis ([[Price identification|price 300]]).

== Monster paralysis ==
Monsters can also be paralyzed in NetHack, a prime example being when pets hit a [[floating eye]]. You can wake them up with nonmagical or uncharged drums or horns. In the case of floating eyes, zapping a [[wand of make invisible]] at the eye can help prevent paralysis.

You can also throw potions of paralysis at monsters, or wield them and break the potion over their head, to paralyze them. Beware of the released vapors that may paralyze you, though; a ring of free action will protect you.

==Helplessness==
A similar condition, '''helplessness''', is caused by the following actions:
*[[engraving]]
*reading a [[cursed spellbook]] (sometimes)
*[[chat]]ting with a [[skeleton]]
*[[fumbling]]
*[[hurtling]] through the air by throwing something while [[levitating]]
*[[prayer|praying]], although a successful prayer also renders you [[invulnerability|invulnerable]] for its duration
*quaffing a [[milky potion]] and producing a ghost
*entering a deserted [[temple]] and producing a ghost
*using a [[crystal ball]]
This state is identical to paralysis except that it cannot be prevented by a [[ring of free action]] or any other means.  However, all means of inducing this state require some deliberate action on the player's part, so the state is always avoidable.

* [[tooled horn]]
* [[fire horn]]
* [[frost horn]]
* [[horn of plenty]]

All horns except for the [[horn of plenty]] are [[musical instrument]]s.

All horns weigh 18. All horns cost 50 Zm, except for the [[tooled horn]] which costs 15 Zm.

The [[unicorn horn]] is also technically a horn, but it does not share the same appearance as the other horns (unless you are [[blind]]).  It costs 100 Zm. If positively enchanted, it costs additional 10 Zm per unit of enchantment, e.g. +2 unicorn horn costs 120 Zm.

Some monsters have [[Body parts#Horns|horn(s)]].

==Identification==

The tooled horn (and unicorn horn, if you are blind) can be identified via [[price identification]].

Unless you are blind or hallucinating, or a horn has no charges (can happen on [[bones]]), all horns can be identified via applying them and replying "yes" to "Improvise?"

* Playing on tooled horn, you either "produce a frightful, grave sound" or (if confused) "What you produce is quite far from music..."  It would also awake nearby mosters.
* Playing on [[fire horn|fire horn]] or [[frost horn]] will emit a [[ray]] of fire or cold respectively, and auto-identify the horn. 
* Playing on [[horn of plenty]] will produce food or potion.

The '''cave spider''', {{monsym|cave_spider}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[NetHack]]. They are capable of [[hiding]] under items, taking some players by surprise. Cave spider [[corpses]] have a 7% chance of granting the [[poison resistance]] [[intrinsic]].

Cave spiders can [[grow up]] into [[giant spider]]s.{{refsrc|mondata.c|569}}

==Generation==
Cave spiders are often generated in [[groups]]. As a grounded hiding monster, cave spiders generated via level creation will always be given a random item to hide under.

==Strategy==
While not particularly dangerous for the first hiding monsters you are likely to encounter, cave spiders have a somewhat low AC that can make it slightly difficult to hit them. Throwing an item at them will cause them to hide under it most of the time; this is useful for keeping them at bay and picking them off, or even escaping if the situation warrants it.

This can also be put to use in some [[treasure zoo]]s, where a hiding cave spider can block the door and hem in the other monsters; you can then attack them from range at your leisure, e.g. with a [[polearm]] or [[lance]].

{{encyclopedia|<poem>
I observed here, what I had often seen before, that certain districts abound in centipedes.  Here they have light reddish bodies and blue legs; great myriapedes are seen crawling every where.  Although they do no harm, they excite in man a feeling of loathing.  Perhaps our appearance produces a similar feeling in the elephant and other large animals.  Where they have been much disturbed, they certainly look upon us with great distrust, as the horrid biped that ruins their peace.

The '''giant spider''', {{monsym|giant spider}}, is a [[monster]] in [[NetHack]]. They are faster than [[you]] and have a rather damaging [[poison]]ous [[bite]]; however they are too large to be able to [[hiding|hide]] as some of their kin are capable of. This does not stop NetHack from giving them an item to hide under if they are created with the level though, just like the other snakes and spiders who can hide.{{refsrc|makemon.c|959}} Their corpses are poisonous.

If you are polymorphed into a giant spider you can spin [[Trap#.22_Web|webs]] using the #monster command without using up any power. Spinning a web inside of a monster with a digestion attack will cause it to spit you out (webs do not bother other engulfers). Spinning a web can be used to remove a (spiked) pit, hole, trap door, or rolling boulder trap. This is done without creating a web on the same square that must be removed. Since most other traps can be removed by digging a pit over them, it is possible to permanently remove almost any trap.

Every [[web trap]] is generated with a giant spider, and most (3 out of 4, or all of them if you have the [[Amulet of Yendor]]) giant spiders generated with the level are given webs.{{refsrc|mklev.c|1266}}{{refsrc|mklev.c|763}} Therefore, you will usually, but not always, see webs and giant spiders together.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Giant spiders now weigh 200.}}

In dNethack, giant spiders can grow up into '''mirkwood spiders''', spiders with a web attack and poisonous bite.

They are faster than [[you]], have a [[poison]]ous sting, and can [[hiding|hide]] under items, making them a dangerous opponent for low level characters. Their corpses are poisonous, and convey poison resistance 50% of the time. Scorpions are frequently generated in the [[ranger quest]].

Fighting with a scorpion can be fatal if you lack poison resistance or high [[magic cancellation]]. If you have poor strength (or a bad weapon), then don't fight them in melee! Try to use spells/wands/projectiles or (semi)permanent [[Elbereth|E-word]].

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
A sub-species of the spider (_Scorpionidae_), the scorpion
distinguishes itself from them by having a lower body that
ends in a long, jointed tail tapering to a poisonous stinger.
They have eight legs and pincers.

&&%s&& %s Hiding {130726 2020-01-14T01:36:22Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  In ''[[NetHack]]'', some [[monsters]] have the ability to '''hide'''. [[Trapper]]s, [[lurkers above]], and various [[piercer]]s can innately hide on the ceiling. [[Cave spider]]s and all [[snake]]s except [[water moccasin]]s can hide under objects on the ground. [[Mimic]]s can disguise as objects, which is related. All [[;|sea monsters]] can hide in [[water]].

Moving next to a monster hidden in this manner grants them an opportunity to attack you unnoticed, and attempting to move onto the tile where they are produces "[[Wait!]] There's a [[foo]] hiding under <an item>!", wasting your movement time. This also goes for movement with the {{kbd|m}} command (sometimes except if you are [[warned]] of the creature).

If you know exactly where the hiding monster is and are already adjacent, you can simply use the {{kbd|F}} command to [[fight]] it. Otherwise, the monster will get a turn, and hence a chance to hit you, before you do. It is possible to hit hidden monsters with [[ranged weapon]]s or [[throw]]n objects, making it fairly easy for wary players to detect them. [[Gold]] is good to throw because it is abundant, does not risk breaking [[pacifist]] conduct, and gets you [[credit]] in [[store]]s.

[[Search]]ing is guaranteed to reveal their position, and causes them to stick to you if applicable. 

==Player hiding==
If you are [[polymorph]]ed into a monster capable of hiding, you can use the #[[Monster (command)|monster]] command to hide under objects or on the ceiling. As of [[NetHack 3.6.4]], if you are polymorphed into a monster capable of hiding on the ceiling, you can use '''{{kbd|>}}''' to unhide.

&&%s&& %s Autopickup {133381 2020-04-10T02:34:54Z {4000580 Hackerb9} /* .nethackrc file examples */ Add more complex example '''Autopickup''' is an [[option]], on by default, that specifies that your character automatically picks up any [[item]] on the square he/she moves onto. 

While this may seem convenient, it often causes problems, particularly with heavy or dangerous items<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9oMSPzChgk death before receiving move] is an extreme example</ref>. However, in most cases these problems can be mitigated by proper application of the [[option#pickup_types|pickup_types]] and [[option#pickup_burden|pickup_burden]] options.

To toggle autopickup, you can select it from the Options menu or press {{kbd|@}}.

If [[Options#pickup_types|pickup_types]] is left as <tt>all</tt>, then autopickup can be used whenever it is necessary to pick up items on a [[teleport trap]] or [[hole]] (for example, in [[Sokoban]]) where the player would otherwise not have a chance to pick up the items before being whisked away. Pickups caused by autopickup take place in the same turn as the movement (which is not possible without autopickup), so it can be used to pickup items saving a turn, which is useful if you are fleeing or doing a speed ascension.  

It is possible to refine autopickup options even further with [[autopickup_exception]]s, but this feature is still in experimental stages and may have some bugs.

== .nethackrc file examples ==

Here is a typical entry from the [[.nethackrc]] file which one might have:

<pre>
# Auto pickup only items considered "generally safe": 
# gold, scrolls, potions, wands, rings, amulets, and spellbooks.
OPTIONS=autopickup, pickup_types:$?!/="+
# But don't pickup a scroll of scare monster
AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION=">scroll of scare monster"

</pre>

Here is how to turn off auto pickup:

<pre>
# Disable auto pickup by default (can toggle by pressing '@')
OPTIONS=!autopickup
</pre>

Here is a more complex example which uses [[Autopickup_exception|AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION]]s. Later entries taking precedence over earlier ones. There are many and varied tricksy things you can do, like picking up food, but not corpses, except, ''yes'', corpses that are light and yummy. See the entry for [[Autopickup_exception|AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION]] for full details.
<pre>
OPTIONS=autopickup

# Ask first if an item would exceed a burden level (default stressed):
# (Unencumbered, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, Overtaxed, or overLoaded)
OPTIONS=pickup_burden:unencumbered

# Note: pickup_types is only consulted if no EXCEPTION matches.
OPTIONS=pickup_types:$?!/(

# Always pick these:
AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION="<magic lamp"
AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION="<wand of wishing"
AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION="<wand of death"
AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION="<wand of polymorph"
# Don't pick these:
AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION=">worthless piece of"

The '''ring of aggravate monster''' is a [[ring]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==

Rings of aggravate monster are generated [[cursed]] 90% of the time. 

==Effects==
Wearing this ring gives you the property of [[aggravate monster]], as does [[eating jewelry|eating it]].

== Strategy ==
The ring of aggravate monster is generally considered undesirable, and is frequently used as [[polypile]] fodder; however, stealth can override the worst of the ring's effects, and the ring also has a few outside uses. One such use is to lure monsters to a desired location, such as an [[altar]], when you are [[invisible]].

==Messages==

The '''elven arrow''' is a type of [[arrow]] for use with a [[bow]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It appears as a '''runed arrow''' when [[identification|unidentified]]. Elven arrows are [[wood]]en and susceptible to [[erosion|rotting and burning]] attacks.

Elven arrows gain +1 [[multishot]] and a +1 damage bonus when fired by an [[Elf (starting race)|elven]] player from an [[elven bow]].{{refsrc|src/dothrow.c|167|nethack=3.6.6|comment=multishot bonus}}{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|848|nethack=3.6.6|comment=damage bonus}}

==Generation==
An elven [[Ranger]]'s two sets of starting +0 and +2 arrows will always be elven arrows.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|208|nethack=3.6.6}}

{{frac|3}} of [[Elf (monster attribute)|elven]] monsters are [[monster starting inventory|generated with]] an elven bow and {{rn1|12|3}} elven arrows.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|222|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
Elven arrows often generate on elves, and are marginally stronger than (standard) arrows. They should be preferred over arrows of the same enchantment, unless you receive a racial multishot bonus for another kind of arrow.

==History==
The elven arrow was introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], the [[Castle (UnNetHack)|Castle]] has a chance to generate blessed and enchanted elven arrows in the [[barracks]] overlooking the [[drawbridge]].

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], a non-cursed elven arrow has a 1 in 3 chance of a +1 bonus to multishot - e.g., a player that would normally only shoot 1 arrow will shoot d2 arrows 33% of the time, a player that would normally shoot d2 arrows will shoot d3 arrows 33% of the time, etc.{{refsrc|dothrow.c|175|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} This bonus does not apply to [[dark elven arrow]]s.
