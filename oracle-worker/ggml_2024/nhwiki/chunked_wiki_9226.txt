A pair of '''Orihalcyon gauntlets''' provides [[magic resistance]]; this makes you immune to many of the nastier [[trap]]s, and any [[wand of striking]] or magic missiles fired by an enemy.

==Identification==

Orihalcyon gauntlets are made of rustproof metal.  As the only other metal gloves are the [[gauntlets of power]], which have an obvious effect when worn, a [[touchstone]] can be used to unambiguously identify orihalcyon gauntlets.

Even if you observe orihalcyon gauntlets nullifying an effect, they will not self-identify.

== Origin ==

Orihalcyon gauntlets come from the (sadly defunct) webcomic [http://bookwyrms.comicgenesis.com/ Bookwyrms].  The name is presumably a portmanteau of 'orichalcum' and 'halcyon.'

&&%s&& %s Locksmith {148502 2022-10-05T01:01:25Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} missed a bit {{todo|Role exists de-SLEXed in [[SlashTHEM]] - retool accordingly}}
The '''Locksmith''' is a [[role]] in the variant [[SlashTHEM]].  

The Locksmith first appeared in an early version of [[SLASH'EM]] ([[NetHack-- 3.0.10]]) but was dropped from the code at the time the [[quest]] branch was ported into that variant.  The role was later revived and given a quest in SlashTHEM.

In SlashTHEM the Locksmith gets a bonus to [[Unlocking tool|picking locks]], similar to the [[Rogue]] role.

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Locksmiths could use any weapons. 

SLASHTHEM gives the Locksmith a skill set closer to the [[Rogue]]'s:

{| class="prettytable"
! colspan="2" style="font-size:larger" | Locksmith skills
|-
! Max !! Skills
|-
| Basic
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[two handed sword]], [[morning star]], [[flail]], [[hammer]], [[polearms]], [[spear]]
* ''Combat:'' [[riding]]
|-
| Skilled
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[broad sword]], [[long sword]], [[scimitar]], [[saber]], [[club]], [[paddle]], [[mace]], [[shuriken]]
* ''Spells:'' [[divination spells|divination]], [[body spells|body]], [[matter spells|matter]]
|-
| Expert
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[dagger]], [[knife]], [[short sword]], [[firearm]], [[crossbow]], [[dart]]
* ''Combat:'' [[two weapon combat]], [[bare hands]]
|}

The Locksmith's [[special spell]], fittingly enough, is [[knock]].  Spell success is determined by [[intelligence]].

*SlashTHEM u_init.c line 2055 in v. 0.8

==Intrinsics==
* XL 1: [[Searching]]

==Starting equipment==
* [[Wand of opening]]
* [[Wand of locking]]
* A [[skeleton key]]
* A [[lock pick]]
* A [[sack]]
* 5 +0 [[dagger]]s (SlashTHEM)

==Rank titles==
SLASHTHEM has a slightly different set of rank titles:

* XL 1-2: Listener
* XL 3-5: Lockpicker
* XL 6-9: Lock Breaker
* XL 10-13: Lock Trickster
* XL 14-17: Safecracker
* XL 18-21: Keymaster
* XL 22-25: Slim Jim/Slim Jane
* XL 26-29: Keymaker
* XL 30: Supreme Locksmith

SlashTHEM role.c line 860

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Locksmith fighting Burglar Ed for the Nocturnal Key, a chaotic [[skeleton key]] which grants [[hallucination resistance]] and functions as a [[luckstone]] when carried. When used, it gives a random [[rumor]], similar to the [[Master Key of Thievery]]. It can be [[invoke]]d to [[branchport]].

SlashTHEM gives the Locksmith a new [[quest artifact]], the Lockpick of Arsene Lupin, a neutral [[lockpick]]. When carried, it grants [[telepathy]], [[stealth]], [[warning]], and [[magic resistance]], and functions as a luckstone. When used, it gives a random rumor, and it can be invoked to untrap a door or container with 100% success.

*SlashTHEM artilist.h line 824

==Gods==
The Locksmith's gods are taken from Celtic mythology:

* Lawful: Nuada
* Neutral: Dagda
* Chaotic: Morrigan

==History==
The Locksmith's first appearance was in [[SLASH'EM]] precursor [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], as one of nine new roles in addition to the twelve in [[NetHack 3.0.10|the contemporary version of NetHack]].  The discussion thread in which the authors first announced the variant suggests that some of the new roles were taken from a list proposing a role for every letter of the alphabet. See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.hack/jg8YtQX1M3Y/tbBlteXdYY8J here] for the relevant 
post.

After the release of [[NetHack 3.1.3]] in 1993, NetHack-- was updated to [[NetHack-- 3.1.3]] by porting some of the changes from NetHack-- 3.0.10 into a patch for the newest version.  Due to some changes in the vanilla code, however, some content was removed to improve compatibility with NetHack.  Most significantly, NetHack 3.1 had seen the addition of the [[Quest]] branch.  To avoid the challenge of fitting full-length quests for the roles that had been added in NetHack-- 3.0.10 into the patch code, those roles were simply left out of the patch.

The Locksmith role, along with the other eight new roles in NetHack-- 3.0.10, made its reappearance in the variant SlashTHEM.

The '''Musician''' is a [[role]] in the variant  [[SlashTHEM]].  

The Musician first appeared in an early version of [[SLASH'EM]] ([[NetHack-- 3.0.10]]) but was dropped from the code at the time the [[quest]] branch was ported into that variant.

The Musician's main advantage is its starting inventory, consisting of every type of magical [[musical instrument]].

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Musicians could use any weapons. 

SLASHTHEM gives the Musician a skill set modeled on the [[Bard]]'s (including the ability to use [[Bard#Musicalize spell|music]]):

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Musician fighting Draco the Sharpshooter for the Blackharp, a chaotic [[magic harp]] which grants [[warning]], [[teleport control]], and [[drain resistance]] while carried.

SlashTHEM gives the Musician a new [[quest artifact]], the Harp of Harmony, a lawful magic harp which grants warning, [[stealth]], and drain resistance while carried, and speaks a random [[rumor]] when played.  It can be [[invoke]]d to [[tame]] monsters.

*SlashTHEM artilist.h line 674

==Gods==
The Musician's gods are Melnibonean, drawn from Michael Moorcock's fantasy series starring [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elric_of_Melnibon%C3%A9 Elric of Melnibon√©] (the source also of [[Stormbringer]]):

[[File:Quest1.png|thumb|320px|The quest home level, cleared out.]]
The Dev Team is inside the larger enclosure, accompanied by eight hackers.

Inside the upper enclosure are monsters whose glyphs spell out "May the force be with you", and inside the side room of the lower one are monsters spelling out "WELCOME" in the same way. Spaces are represented by random {{white|:}}. The walls on the level are diggable, so all [[h|{{white|h}}]] are [[hobbit]]s and the {{white|r}} is a [[sewer rat]], to avoid generating [[dwarves]] or [[rock moles]] that could [[tunnel]] through the walls. The {{white|u}} is a ''young unicorn'' (presumably so the Geek cannot exploit a coaligned [[unicorn]], or tame a [[pony]]/[[horse]]), the {{white|L}} is a fairly harmless baby lich, and the {{white|W}} is a [[wraith]]. 

The downstair is located at the position of the [[M]] in the upper enclosure.

The level contains an [[amulet of ESP]] and a [[blindfold]] ("to ensure that the player can see the artwork"), two [[potion of Jolt Cola|potions of Jolt Cola]], a [[wand of digging]], and eight random objects, all randomly scattered throughout the level. There are also four random [[trap]]s.

 "A level being seemingly harmless may prove to be fatal by monsters suddenly transforming one into another"

[[File:GeekQuest2.png|thumb|320px|The quest locate level, showing one possible location of the downstair.]]
The upstair is at a random location somewhere on the level. The downstair is located at one of the six numbered spots; the others contain an [[amulet of life saving]], an [[amulet of strangulation]], two [[giant mimic]]s imitating the downstair, and a [[polymorph trap]]. The walls are diggable and teleportation is permitted, so the two enclosed spaces should not be difficult to reach if necessary. The floor is non-diggable, however.

Scattered throughout the level are eight random objects, sixteen monsters, and eight traps.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You now enter what is pretty known to you - it is the location of
 [[DevTeam|the Holy Development Team]], which in a year-long effort developed
 the computer game "NetHack". 
 
 With a sudden feeling of melancholy you remember the patches you
 yourself wrote and contributed to that game. You truly believe
 that this game is the best of all games known to mankind.
 
 However -- something has changed. At first you cannot tell what,
 but then you notice. Everywhere there are hostile monsters like
 the ones you used to program in NetHack, but, now in reality.
 What the heck is going on here?!

Next time:
 Once again you approach the Dev Team's location.
If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 As you again approach the Dev Team's location you fear it might be the last time you see this place.

===Quest guardians===
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Written any patches lately?"
 "Do _you_ know what erf(3M) does?"
 "How do you like this implementation of the Ravenous Bugblatter of Traal" You reply, "Be careful not to get sued for copyright infringement!"
 :-)
 "May the force be with you!"

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Looking good, <playername>!"
 "Eureka! Oh, sorry, just practising..."
 "As I expected. Oh, wait a minute... that's not what I expected!"
 "It appears our defenses against Bill Gates have completely failed..."
 "Well, there goes the neighborhood. Next we'll be seeing Space Balls."

===Quest leader===
When you first meet your quest leader:
 "It is a pleasure to see you again, <playername>.
 
 Horrible things have happened since our last meeting and I really need
 a brave Hacker to clean up things for once and all.
 Let me see whether you are really able to cope with the task ... "

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Please stand still while I [[Spellbook of finger|finger]](1) your state ..."
This message is not currently used:
 $ finger <playername>
When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "This was too much. You'll never attain the state of Hackishness.
 Now begone!"
When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "I see you fighting Bill Gates and finally being done in by him, who we call
 The Dark Lord Of Software.
 
 No, I can't let you go like this, I really can't see a chance of a 
 <current rank> fighting against Him. 
 
 I can only ask you to train some more until you have achieved the
 Hacker's state of ability."
When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "Foo!
 You have strayed from the path of <deity>!
 Trying to destroy Bill Gates in this state of mind would mean the sure death
 of your hackish soul!
 
 Purify yourself, until you're again piously aligned with Our God,
 and then come again and I will admit you."
When finally assigned the quest:
 "I now see that you are truly worthy to fight Bill Gates, my <sister/brother>.
 
 Half a year ago, a young programmer, known to everybody as Bill Gates, came
 to me to get a hackish education. I was suspicious from the first
 moment on, but I admitted him for testing and let him stay.
 
 Several days later, upon waking up, I found the NetHack Sources to be missing.
 Bill Gates was away as well.
 
 You are my last hope. If you fail to regain the NetHack Sources, NetHack development
 is doomed to stop forever!"

====Encouragement====
If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "May <deity> protect you!"
 "Remember, He is completely evil, yet not invulnerable!"
 :-)
 "I know you can do it!"
 "Our fate is up to you now."
 "A level being seemingly harmless may prove to be fatal by monsters
 suddenly transforming one into another"
 "It is rumoured that Bill Gates filled His lair with deadly traps."
 "Do you know what 'memalezu' means?"
 "They say that you can escape the dungeon by teleporting to level 0."
 "Nobody here has an idea what to use a silver bell for."

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 You have a sure feeling that you will soon find the entrace to the the [sic] Microsoft headquarter.
 You *know* you can do it!
When returning:
 Once again you enter this place and once again you are sure you will succeed.
When first entering the goal level:
 You now almost smell the NetHack Sources.
When returning:
 Once again you sense the NetHack Sources.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 You will never retrieve the NetHack Sources!
Upon further meetings:
 You're doomed! You will end your life as a litte programmer slave earning
 $1000 ... per year! ... before taxes!
And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 You will never succeed! You could give up now as well!
When you have the NetHack Sources, but Bill Gates is still alive:
 I will now get the NetHack Sources back from you and then I will make you the MS-DOS
 Project Manager. This will be enough torture for you!

====Discouragement====
Bill Gates will occasionally utter maledictions:
 FORMAT C: /V /S
 You will die now, as sure as if you quaffed a [[potion of cyanide]]!
 I think I'll be generous. I will let you have a little fun with my
 pet succubus before you die ...
 "Perhaps you should consider the following qoute [sic] from Terry Pratchett:
  "But I don't know how to use a sword!"
  "Put the blunt end in your hand and the sharp end in the enemy!"
  "There must be more to it than that!"
  "Remember which end is which."
 "What? You said 'Microsloth'? Then die, bastard!"
 "I will soon format your body, mind and soul!"
 "I've got an idea: we can greatly speed this up (and save much pain
 for you). You just have to take your sword and push it into your
 stomach. Or, if you prefer, take a COBOL programming course."
 "Don't worry, your pains will soon be over!"
 "I'm wondering all the time why somebody like you does something like this.
 Does pain excite you or what? Well, I have a *great* sortiment of whips handy!"
 "Nobody will ever need more than 640 KB of RAM."

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 You feel the power of the NetHack Sources flow through your body. Although you know
 you have to return it to the Dev Team, you now feel like you could continue
 developing NetHack on your own now.
When killing the nemesis:
 You see Bill Gates lying dead in a puddle of blood. Not a second do you 
 regret what you've done.
When returning to your quest leader:
 "You've finally got the NetHack Sources back! I am very grateful for what you've done.
 
 Yet, I am an old man and I will not long more be able to supervise
 NetHack. Therefore I pass the duty on to your young and responsible
 hands. Take the sources and expand them at your leisure, but be
 careful to maintain game balance.
 
 My ultimate secret is: Nothing is true. Everything is allowed."
When subsequently throwing the NetHack Sources to the Dev Team:
 "Yes, the NetHack Sources are really yours now. Use them wisely.
 
 And remember: Nothing is true. Everything is allowed.
 Be careful to maintain game balance."
===Post-quest===

When talking to the Dev Team after the quest:
 Latest news regarding the Amulet Of Yendor?

When talking to the Dev Team after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Now I see you with the Amulet Of Yendor shining brightly in your
 pack. Honestly, I didn't believe you'd (or anyone else, for that
 matter) would manage to tear it from the hands of Moloch.
 
 Your way is up now, back to the first level of the Dungeon, and
 beyond there. You now must leave the dungeon as you've entered
 it.
 
 Then you will get to four planes, dedicated to the four arcane elements
 of [[Plane of Earth|earth]], [[Plane of Air|air]], [[Plane of Fire|fire]] and [[Plane of Water|water]]. If thou successfully pass all these,
 you will eventually reach [[Astral plane|the stars]] (or astra, as the Greek called
 them). This is where the sacred High Temples of the aligned gods
 are located. 
 
 Return the amulet to <deity> at His altar, and you will be richly rewarded."

===Miscellaneous===
When being rejected for permanently changing alignment:
 "You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to <deity>, as you once did.
 My allegiance to <deity> holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you 
 have done.
 
 Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at the Dev Team's location again.
 That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
 you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
 resides.
 
 Go now!  You are banished from this place.
When talking to the Dev Team while carrying the NetHack Sources, but Bill Gates is still alive:
 "The silver bell which was hoarded by Bill Gates will be
 essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."

{{wikipedia|Ninja}}
''This article is about the Ninja role that appears in SLASHTHEM. "Ninja" is also one of the NetHack [[Samurai#Rank titles|Samurai rank titles]]. For the monster in NetHack 3.6.0, see [[Ninja]].''

The '''Ninja''' is a [[role]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. The role draws on two earlier Ninja roles - one is a [[Defunct features|defunct feature]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' which was eventually replaced by the [[Rogue]], and the other originated from [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], an ancestor of [[SLASH'EM]]. Female Ninja are referred to as '''[[wikipedia:Kunoichi|Kunoichi]]''' by the game.

In NetHack, "Ninja" and "Kunoichi" are the male and female rank titles of a Samurai from [[experience level]]s 6 to 9. In SlashTHEM, the equivalent rank title is "Kumigashira" (which translates roughly to "squad leader").

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Ninja could use any weapons.

SLASHTHEM gives the Ninja a skill set reminiscent of both the Rogue and [[Samurai]]:

{| class="prettytable"
! colspan="2" style="font-size:larger" | Ninja skills
|-
! Max !! Skills
|-
| Basic
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[two handed sword]], [[morning star]], [[hammer]], [[spear]]

* ''Spells:'' [[protection spells|protection]], [[body spells|body]]

* ''Combat:'' [[two weapon combat]]
|-

|}

The Ninja's [[special spell]] is [[spellbook of enchant weapon|enchant weapon]].  Spell success is determined by [[intelligence]].

*SLASHTHEM u_init.c line 2081 in v. 0.8

==Techniques==
Ninja gain these [[technique]]s in SLASHTHEM:

==Intrinsics==

In SLASHTHEM, Ninja gain [[searching]] instead of invisibility at XL 3.  They continue to gain additional abilities:
* XL 5: [[Speed]]
* XL 10: [[Swimming]]
* XL 15: [[Warning]]

SLASHTHEM attrib.c line 71

==Starting equipment==
* A blessed +0 [[wakizashi]] (short sword)
* 9 [[shuriken]]
* An uncursed [[potion of sickness]]
* A blessed [[potion of invisibility]]
* An [[osaku]] (lock pick)
* +1 [[leather cloak]] (SlashTHEM)
* +1 [[low boots]] (SlashTHEM)
* A +0 kaginawa ([[grappling hook]]) (SlashTHEM)

The Ninja starts with a [[pet]] [[little dog]].

The SlashTHEM Ninja will know the starting shuriken as "hira-shuriken" (flat shuriken), as part of an expanded list of [[Samurai#Japanese names for items|Japanese item names]]. This reflects the fact that the term "[[wikipedia:Shuriken|shuriken]]" was historically also used to refer to other thrown (and sometimes wielded) weapons, not only the star-shaped projectiles associated with the term in Western culture. [[Dart]]s are known as "bo-shuriken" (stick shuriken).

==Item names==
Like the [[Samurai]], the Ninja has alternate names for items that follow a [[Alternate item names#Japanese|Japanese theme]].

==Rank titles==
SLASHTHEM has a different set of rank titles:

* XL 1-2: Kukkyu
* XL 3-5: Hakkyu
* XL 6-9: Nanakyu
* XL 10-13: Rokkyu
* XL 14-17: Gokyu
* XL 18-21: Yonkyu
* XL 22-25: Sankyu
* XL 26-29: Nikyu
* XL 30: Ikkyu

SlashTHEM role.c line 1005

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Ninja fighting Jaquio for the Dragonclan Sword, a lawful [[katana]] which has a chance of beheading enemies, like the [[Vorpal Blade]].

SLASHTHEM gives the Ninja a new [[quest artifact]], Fuma-itto no Ken, a chaotic ninja-to ([[broadsword]]) which adds +8 to-hit and +8 to damage, grants [[drain resistance]] while carried, and can be invoked to create a stack of [[shuriken|hira-shuriken]].  This weapon was adapted from [[dNetHack Artifacts#Fuma-itto no Ken|an artifact of the same name]] from [[dNetHack]].

==History==
The Ninja of vanilla ''NetHack'' was a role that existed from [[NetHack 1.3d]] to [[NetHack 2.3e]], and was replaced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]] by the [[Rogue]], making it a [[defunct feature]]; this Ninja had a much simpler inventory than the current role, consisting of a [[katana]], +1 [[leather armor]], and up to 25 [[shuriken]].<ref>[[Source:NetHack 2.3e/u init.c#line184|NetHack 2.3e u_init.c, line 184]]</ref> [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], a variant of [[NetHack 3.0.10]] and precursor of [[SLASH'EM]], included a revived Ninja role alongside the Rogue as one of nine new roles - the discussion thread in which the authors first announced the variant suggests that some of the new roles were taken from a list proposing a role for every letter of the alphabet.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.hack/jg8YtQX1M3Y/tbBlteXdYY8J rec.games.hack discussion on NetHack-- roles]</ref>

After the release of [[NetHack 3.1.3]] in 1993, NetHack-- was updated to [[NetHack-- 3.1.3]] by porting some of the changes from NetHack-- 3.0.10 into a patch for the newest version. Due to some changes in the vanilla code, however, some content was removed to improve compatibility with NetHack. Most significantly, NetHack 3.1 had seen the addition of the [[Quest]] branch. To avoid the challenge of fitting full-length quests for the roles that had been added in NetHack-- 3.0.10 into the patch code, those roles were simply left out of the patch.

The Ninja role, along with the other eight roles from NetHack-- 3.0.10, appeared in [[Slash'EM Extended]] and then in SlashTHEM, which adjusted the overall role and their quest and tailored them to be closer to their NetHack-- incarnation, with a [[wakizashi]], potions of sickness and invisibility, a lock pick, and intrinsic stealth.

An '''ugly backpack''' is a type of [[container]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]]. It is made of [[cloth]].

==Generation==
The ugly backpack is is not randomly generated; all [[Graduate]]s start with an uncursed one.

==Strategy==
The ugly backpack is mostly equivalent to a standard [[sack]], though it has a higher base price of 50 [[zm]].

==Origin==
The item comes from the Geek role in [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], a precursor to [[SLASH'EM]]; it is not to be confused with the [[Geek]] role in [[NetHack: The Next Generation]], which was also added to SlashTHEM.

{{wikipedia|Police officer}}

The '''Officer''' is a [[role]] in the variant [[SlashTHEM]].  

The Officer first appeared in an early version of [[SLASH'EM]] ([[NetHack-- 3.0.10]]) but was dropped from the code at the time the [[quest]] branch was ported into that variant.  The role was later revived and given a quest in SlashTHEM.

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Officers could use any weapons. 

SlashTHEM restricts the Officer's selection of weapon skills and adds some moderate spellcasting skills:

{| class="prettytable"
! colspan="2" style="font-size:larger" | Officer skills
|-
! Max !! Skills
|-
| Basic
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[two handed sword]], [[javelin]], [[sling]], [[crossbow]]
* ''Spells:'' [[matter spells|matter]]
|-
| Skilled
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[knife]], [[long sword]], [[scimitar]], [[saber]]
* ''Spells:'' [[healing spells|healing]]
* ''Combat:'' [[riding]], [[bare hands]]
|-
| Expert
|
* ''Weapons:'' [[dagger]], [[short sword]], [[broad sword]], [[quarterstaff]], [[club]], [[spear]], [[bow]], [[firearms]]
* ''Spells:'' [[enchantment spells|enchantment]]
* ''Combat:'' [[two weapon combat]]
|}

The Officer's [[special spell]] is resist petrification.  Spell success is determined by [[intelligence]].

*SlashTHEM u_init.c line 1804 in v. 0.8

==Intrinsics==
* XL 1: [[Searching]]
* XL 10: [[Warning]]

==Starting equipment==
* +0 [[pistol]]
* 100 uncursed +0 [[bullet]]s
* +0 [[club]]
* +0 [[leather armor]]
* A [[wand of magic missile]]
* A [[wand of striking]]
* 6 [[Hacker's Food]]s

SlashTHEM slightly modifies the officer's starting equipment:
* +0 [[pistol]]
* 30 +0 [[bullet]]s
* +0 [[club]]
* +0 [[leather armor]]
* 6 [[doughnut]]s

NetHack-- did not include [[firearms]], so originally the Officer's only starting means of defense/offense was a club and the two wands, which were probably meant to represent sidearms.  Both current incarnations of the role have the wands, even though the Officer now gets a gun.  The SlashTHEM Officer starts with the club wielded.

In NetHack--, the Officer's starting food was a stack of doughnuts; this is also true of SlashTHEM, which also makes them a food item that can be randomly generated.

In SlashTHEM, Officers start with a tame [[little dog]].

*SlashTHEM u_init.c line 223 in v. 0.8

==Rank titles==
SLASHTHEM has a different set of rank titles:

* XL 30: Commissioner

SlashTHEM role.c line 1059

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Officer fighting Grandpa Tank Breaker for the [[Shiny Magnum]], a lawful [[pistol]] with to-hit and physical damage bonuses.

SlashTHEM gives the Officer a new [[quest artifact]], the Whistle of the Warden, a lawful [[magic whistle]] which grants [[telepathy]], [[teleport control]], and [[drain resistance]] while carried.  It can be invoked for "leadership", revealing the location of all [[pet]]s on the level and increasing the [[tameness]] of those within line of sight.

*SlashTHEM artilist.h line 621

==Gods==
* Lawful: Magnum
* Neutral: Smith
* Chaotic: Wesson

==History==
The Officer's first appearance was in [[SLASH'EM]] precursor [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], as one of nine new roles in addition to the twelve in [[NetHack 3.0.10|the contemporary version of NetHack]]. The discussion thread in which the authors first announced the variant suggests that some of the new roles were taken from a list proposing a role for every letter of the alphabet. See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.hack/jg8YtQX1M3Y/tbBlteXdYY8J here] for the relevant post.

A '''doughnut''' is a [[comestible]] in [[SlashTHEM]].  Doughnuts are considered [[vegetarian]] food and take two turns to eat.

Doughnuts are probably most often seen as the starting food for [[Officer]]s, who begin the game with a stack of six doughnuts in their inventory; this is a feature carried over from [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], the source of the role. Unlike NetHack--, doughnuts can be found randomly generated, but they are quite rare, with the same probability of appearing as a [[tortilla]].

The '''Undertaker''' is a [[role]] in the variant [[SlashTHEM]]. Undertakers are knowledgeable about all things related to [[corpse]]s, including the use of [[wand of undead turning|wands of undead turning]] and [[tinning kit]]s.

The Undertaker first appeared in an early version of [[SLASH'EM]] ([[NetHack-- 3.0.10]]) but was dropped from the code at the time the [[quest]] branch was ported into that variant.  The role was later revived and given a quest in SlashTHEM.

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Undertakers could use any weapons. 
SlashTHEM gives the Undertaker a skill set closer to that of the [[Necromancer]] and [[Undead Slayer]]:

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Undertaker fighting Seducer Saint for Black Death, a chaotic [[halberd]] which adds a [[life drain]] bonus to attacks.

SlashTHEM gives the Undertaker a new [[quest artifact]], the Pick of the Grave, a neutral [[pick axe]] which adds a life drain bonus to attacks and grants [[cold resistance]] while worn and [[regeneration]], [[half physical damage]] and [[teleport control]] while carried.  (Black Death is now an ordinary artifact halberd that can be given as a [[sacrifice gift]] or found randomly generated.)  Invoking the Pick [[bless]]es it, repairs any damage and [[erodeproof]]s it, and, if its enchantment is less than +3, raises it to that value.  This effect cannot be used while the Pick is equipped, however, so this is not a way to free your weapon hand if the Pick gets cursed while wielded.

The '''Zookeeper''' is a [[role]] that first appeared in [[NetHack-- 3.0.10]], an ancestor of [[SLASH'EM]], and re-appears in [[SlashTHEM]].

Zookeepers start with various items that make it easy for them to acquire and maintain [[pet]]s, including [[tripe ration]]s, [[scroll of taming|scrolls of taming]], and [[leash]]es.

==Skills==
NetHack-- 3.0.10 was based on [[NetHack 3.0.10]], which predated the [[skill]] system, so Zookeepers could use any weapons.

SLASHTHEM gives the Zookeeper a weapon skill set that is slightly restricted, but still broad and nuanced, and removes spell skills:

{| class="prettytable"
! colspan="2" style="font-size:larger" | Zookeeper skills

* ''Combat:'' [[bare hands]] 
|-

* ''Weapons:'' [[dagger]], [[whip]], [[spear]]
|}

The Zookeeper's [[special spell]] is [[charm monster]].  Spell success is determined by [[intelligence]].

==Starting equipment==
* A +1 [[bullwhip]]

==Quest==
The [[quest]] sees the Zookeeper fighting Fearful Triceratops for the [[Golden Whistle of Nora]], a lawful [[magic whistle]] which grants [[warning]], [[half physical damage]], and [[ESP]], and can be invoked for [[taming]]. Liontamer is the first [[sacrifice gift]] for Zookeepers.
