  Dungeon collapses after vault guard fails to lead you out.

In 2012, [[User:SGrunt|Grunt]] was able to [https://bilious.alt.org/rgrn/?125385 reproduce it]:

 The straightforward way to reproduce this is as follows: 
 
 1) Teleport into a vault.
 2) Wait for the guard to start leading you out, so that you can observe
    the path he takes. (The bug isn't necessarily reproduced if the guard
    doesn't take a straight path for the first two steps, as this yields
    more than one accessible tile from his stopping point.)
 3) After the guard disappears (once he starts leading you out, you can
    just teleport elsewhere and he'll disappear), teleport back into the
    vault.
 4) Dig out the first two steps of the guard's path after the vault wall
    (such that there are two corridor tiles).
 5) Return to the vault and wait for the guard to lead you out again. 
 
 Result: the guard gets stuck on the last tile dug out. The code that
 extends the corridor believes he's still moving, however, and eventually
 results in an overflow once the length of the internal fake corridor
 buffer is reached, causing a panic().

Nethack 3.6.2 [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/b32c93cacdc68997882f295bbf5ea2c5a9a7faec closed this bug].

It is very rare for a normal game to result in a panic; however, several [[bugs in NetHack 3.4.3]] revolve around panics, usually involving monsters or objects being destroyed under unusual circumstances; exceptions include [[C343-23]], "Dungeon collapses after vault guard fails to lead you out.", and [[bug#C343-383|C343-383]], "Applying a bullwhip while hero is at edge of map may cause a panic or crash."

It is handled through the [[Source:end.c#line251|panic()]] function in [[Source:end.c]].

Less serious errors can result in an [[impossible]] message.

In exceedingly rare circumstances, NetHack may [[Segfault]] instead, without any chance to continue.

==Variants==

In [[NetHack 4]], [[NetHack Fourk]] and [[FIQHack]], a panic gives the player a choice of how to proceed. One option is to reload the game from a backup save (potentially allowing the game to continue, as long as the sequence of events leading up to the panic are not repeated). The other is to leave the save file in its current state, containing a record of all events up to the panic; this leaves the game unplayable in the short term, but may permit gameplay to resume from that point via playing on some future updated game executable in which the bug is fixed.

''NetHack'' generates an '''impossible''' message when something such as a [[monster]] or [[object]] reaches a state that it should not be possible to reach; it displays a short description of the problem, followed by "Program in disorder!  (Saving and reloading may fix this problem.)"{{refsrc|src/pline.c|458|nethack=3.6.1}} These messages are generated by the function {{function|pline.c|impossible}}.

Some [[bugs]] generate impossible messages.  For example, in NetHack 3.4.3, bug C343-33, "Sometimes a monster may remain hidden under a corpse that has rotted away.", can result in a player polymorphed into a hiding monster hiding under a non-existent object, generating the message "[[Source:NetHack 3.4.3/src/mhitu.c#line423|hiding under nothing?]]" when a monster tries to attack the polymorphed player.

If an error results in the session being unable to continue, the game will normally [[panic]] instead of issuing an impossible message.

&&%s&& %s Robe (SLASH'EM) {93918 2015-05-07T17:01:17Z {0 } /* Robe of power */ In [[SLASH'EM]], robes in general are fairly different from their [[robe|vanilla cousins]].  Firstly, they are no longer cloaks, but instead fill the body armor slot.  Lighter even than leather armor, they do not interfere with spellcasting (as all other armors do in SLASH'EM, even [[dragon scale mail]]) or a [[monk]]'s melee abilities or AC bonus (but will remove a doppelganger's AC bonus).  Secondly, there are now magic robes, and all robes have a randomized appearance.  Lastly, no robe provides any [[magic cancellation]].

The randomized appearances for robes are red, orange, green and blue robes.

==Robe==
The most basic '''robe''' is simply a piece of armor.  It is the only robe that can be distinguished by price, costing 25 [[zm]] instead of 50.  It is also frequently found being worn by [[wraith]]s.
{{armor

  |material=leather
}}
A '''robe of protection''' has a considerably higher base AC than other robes, but confers no special abilities.  Its chief use is that it provides a decent amount of AC and does not interfere with spellcasting or a [[monk]]'s martial arts abilities.  Most characters will prefer a good [[mithril]] suit or [[dragon scale mail]], but a monk or an early wizard might find one of these robes desirable.

==Robe of weakness==

  |weight=40
  |material=leather
}}

A '''robe of weakness''' is not a desirable item to wear: it sets your strength to 3.  Its effect will cancel if combined with [[gauntlets of power]].

===Strategy===
Unfortunately, it is not possible to distinguish these robes from robes of power or protection through [[price identification]].  Moreover, these robes are usually generated cursed, so trying on random base-cost 50 robes is not a good idea.  In general, one should use an altar to identify cursed robes to avoid these; 3 strength is a major handicap.

If you can get one that is not cursed, you can use it to make [[exercise]] of strength more effective.

Like its [[robe|vanilla counterpart]], a '''robe of power''' robe enhances your [[spellcasting (SLASH'EM)|spellcasting]] ability, but not as much. Its enchantment makes no difference.

A '''dark elven mithril-coat'''  is a new type of armor in SLASH'EM.  Frequently found on [[drow]], it is functionally identical to [[Mithril-coat|dwarven mithril-coat]].  Note that unlike elven mithril coats, dark elven mithril coats cannot be safely enchanted to +7.

A '''dark elven bow''' is a type of launcher [[weapon]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. [[Plague]] is an artifact dark elven bow.  It is not randomly generated, but may be [[monster starting inventory|found on]] monster [[drow]].  Droven [[ranger]]s will start with one.

==Description==
[[Drow]] players firing arrows from a dark elven bow get a +1 [[to-hit]] bonus; firing [[dark elven arrow]]s from it will also grant +2 [[damage]], or full [[double damage]] while the [[missile flurry]] technique is active.

In [[SLASH'EM]] the '''dark elven short sword''' is a kind of [[melee]] [[weapon]]. When [[identification|unidentified]], it appears as a '''black runed short sword'''. It is slightly more effective in combat than a normal short sword. It is made of wood, so it cannot corrode or rust.

&&%s&& %s Silver long sword {134270 2020-06-09T22:01:22Z {4001313 Ardub23} Added section for object-material silver long swords, differences from SLASH'EM implementation {{weapon

| material=silver
}}

A '''silver long sword''' is a type of [[weapon]] found in [[SLASH'EM]]. It shares all properties with the ordinary [[long sword]], save that it is made of [[silver]]. It is therefore also inherently [[fooproof]], and its weight also increases by 8. However, it is also ineligible to dip for [[Excalibur]]; doing so will not [[rust]] it, but does risk [[cursed|cursing]] it.

SLASH'EM does not have any [[artifact]] silver long swords.

==Other variants==

In variants that implement [[object materials]], such as [[SpliceHack]] and [[xNetHack]], some items may be generated made from different [[material]]s. In these variants, a "silver long sword" is simply an ordinary long sword with a different material, not a distinct item type. This means it can be used to dip for Excalibur, though doing so will change its material to iron.<!--Verify: Do any variants allow non-base-material artifacts? If so, which ones?--> Because iron and silver have the same relative weight, silver long swords weigh the same as iron ones.

}}
In [[SLASH'EM]], the '''dark elven arrow''' is the [[drow]] equivalent of the [[elven arrow]].  Dark elven arrows are carried by non-player [[drow (monster)#SLASH'EM|drow]] and will be the starting arrows for a [[drow (starting race)|drow]] [[ranger]].

Like regular elven arrows, dark elven arrows are made of [[wood]], and do the same amount of damage.  However, the arrows made by surface [[Elf|elves]] have one practical advantage over their subterranean counterparts: SLASH'EM gives a 33% chance of adding an extra [[multishot]] when firing non-[[cursed]] elven arrows, a bonus which does not apply to dark elven arrows {{refsrc|dothrow.c|171|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}.  

It is unclear whether this was an intentional bias or just an oversight in the code.  In any case, drow rangers may wish to trade off (or, given unwanted [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]], [[upgrade]]) their starting arrows for regular elven arrows, or (for a [[to-hit]] bonus and better damage against [[Size|large]] monsters) [[ya]].

The '''scroll of detect magic''', from [[GruntHack]], acts as a [[potion of object detection]] - though it is restricted to detecting [[magical item]]s and [[Object properties|items with abnormal magic properties]] - and also detects [[Monster spell|spellcasting]] monsters.

An [[uncursed]] scroll of detect magic will show you the location of all magical items and items with [[object properties]] on the level, and flag any unidentified items revealed in this fashion with a "magical" prefix as though the player was a [[wizard]].  A [[blessed]] scroll will additionally identify the type of magical item and any [[object properties]]. [[Cursed]] scrolls also detect [[mimic]]s mimicing objects, and will wake up any monsters detected (both [[Monster spell|spellcaster]]s and [[mimic]]s).

It features virtual trophies for achievements and user and clan competitions.

Junethack differs from other tournaments like the [[:/dev/null/nethack tournament|/dev/null/nethack tournament]] insofar as that the users play on participating [[public server]]s instead of dedicated tournament servers. This allows persistent accounts and facilitates the inclusion of variants.

Many of the actively developed NetHack forks are eligible for the tournament.

The Junethack website is used to manage users' accounts and clans and also displaying scoreboards and statistics.

==IRC channel==
The #junethack [[IRC]] channel on irc.libera.chat is where all the developers and players hang out.  Clans often have clan-specific channels for their members as well.

==2012==
The second tournament ran from 1 June to 30 June 2012.

Games:
* [[UnNetHack]]
* [[SporkHack]]
* [[GruntHack]]
* [[AceHack]]
* [[NetHack4]]

==Technicalities==
Users can register their accounts by adding the line ''#junethack username'' to the rcfiles of the server. More information is available on the tournament website, after signing up.

The tournament server records all played games by reading the [[xlogfile]]s of the participating public servers.

The Junethack server software is written in Ruby, with the Sinatra web framework and datamapper as the database interface. The source code is released under GPL 3 and is available from GitHub.
