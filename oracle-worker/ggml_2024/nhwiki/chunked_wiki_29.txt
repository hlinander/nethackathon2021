Having a source of levitation at the [[Castle]] allows players to enter via the back door, thus bypassing the drawbridge, if they are wary of [[giant eel|giant eels]] and [[shark|sharks]].

Using a ring of levitation to hover over [[Elbereth]] is no longer a viable strategy since the engraving will still disappear underneath the player if they take any offensive action.

A '''huge chunk of meat''' is a type of [[comestible]] in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is as massive as its name suggests, and provides the highest [[nutrition]] value of any comestible in the game at 2000 nutrition, but also weighs the most of any non-[[corpse]] comestible at 400 [[aum]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The huge chunk of meat is renamed to '''enormous meatball''' in {{commit|85099512915a46dde1c813a3fbf56b151dd37fe1}}}}

==Generation==
The huge chunk of meat is only created by zapping a [[boulder]] with a spell of [[stone to flesh]].

==Strategy==
Eating a huge chunk of meat will likely make you [[oversatiated]] unless you were fainting beforehand - beware eating '''''anything''''' if you are oversatiated, as you are very likely to choke over your food and die unless you are [[breathless]] or wearing an [[amulet of life saving]].

The huge gain in nutrition will keep you satiated for at least a few hundred turns, which abuses [[dexterity]] - be prepared to exercise enough to potentially offset the stat abuse, or else have a way to fix lowered stats. Said nutrition should also last long enough for you to find some lighter sources of permafood and provide a "buffer" for nutrition drain from any [[spellcasting]]. [[Healer]]s in particular always start with the spell of stone to flesh, which can be cast more reliably once they gain some [[experience level]]s and allows them to keep well-fed so long as they can find boulders. 

==Variants==
===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], huge chunks of meat can appear among the food sold in delicatessen [[shop]]s. [[Hunger hulk]]s also leave behind huge chunks of meat rather than boulders while [[tunneling]].

(While in reality dogs are omnivores, in NetHack they are treated as [[carnivore]]s.)

Eating the corpse of any domestic dog has similar consequences to [[cannibalism]]: it will give you the [[aggravate monster]] intrinsic, but it will not decrease your [[luck]]. [[Cavemen]] and [[orc]]s are exempt from this penalty.

The '''little dog''' is one of the most famous [[NetHack]] [[monster]]s&mdash;it has served as the starting [[pet]] for the [[player]] ever since [[Hack 1.0]], although in recent times you also have the option of starting with a [[kitten]] for a starting pet ([[knight]]s will get a [[pony]] instead). They are capable of [[growing up]] into dogs.

The little dog and its more experienced brethren are sometimes better fighters than newly started characters and can be used to fight for you in the early stages of the game. Nevertheless, they may be more vulnerable than newly started characters against passive attacks, such as [[acid]]ic monsters or [[floating eye]]s. They also are extremely vulnerable to [[falling rock trap]]s and [[rolling boulder trap]]s and many be killed by one within the first hundred turns of a game.

The '''dog''' is a grown-up little dog and is therefore usually encountered as a [[player]]'s [[pet]]. They are capable of growing up into large dogs.

As with their brethren, they are excellent fighters to have as companions to early game characters, but remain vulnerable to [[passive attack]]s. They may have trouble with [[watch captain]]s in [[Minetown]], although regular [[watchmen]] shouldn't pose too much trouble.

The '''large dog''' is a grown-up dog and is therefore usually encountered as a [[player]]'s [[pet]] (especially with early game characters, as they are easy to obtain by training their little dog).

As with their brethren, they are excellent fighters to have as companions to early-game characters, but remain vulnerable to [[passive attack]]s. Eventually, it may be worthwhile to attempt to upgrade your large dog to another monster using a [[polymorph trap]], especially if you have more than one pet.

==Pet dogs==
Dogs are the iconic NetHack pet. The little dog even made [http://web.archive.org/web/20120107055038/http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/january04/sidekicks/index5.shtml Gamespy's top 10 list of video game sidekicks]. Many [[role]]s begin the game with one.

Taming wild dogs is usually easy, because all sizes of dog are considered [[domestic animal]]s. Throwing a meaty [[treat]], a safe fresh meat-based corpse, or processed human food at a hostile or peaceful dog will tame it. Throwing any other comestible at a dog will at least render it peaceful, with the exception of [[cream pie]]s and [[egg]]s (which will break on impact).

As an additional challenge, if it is night and the moon is full, dogs are harder to tame with food; there is only a 1 in 6 chance of success.

All meaty treats can be used to train your dog to [[apport|fetch]].

You can #[[chat]] with your dog to get an idea of how it is feeling:
* at night when the moon is full, it will always howl.
* it will whine if it is hungry, caught in a [[trap]], [[confused]], fleeing, or [[tameness]] is getting low.
* if the dog is [[leash]]ed, and there is a [[trap]] nearby, it will whine without you #chatting to it. This works even if the trap is undetected.
* if it will be hungry soon (1000 turns or less), it will bark.
* the rest of the time it will yip.

&&%s&& %s Hallucination {149366 2022-12-14T23:38:59Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* dNetHack */ copy over note In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''hallucination''' is a status-impairing [[property]] that will cause you to perceive objects and monsters in a distorted fashion. Hallucination shows up on the status line as "Hallu".
 
==Description==
While hallucinating, [[object]] glyphs will be seen as continually changing items of the same class - a [[pick-axe]] may be seen as a [[sack]] or [[dagger]], but not as a [[monster]]. This also applies to items in your inventory or on your square, but the actual appearance of those items will be accurately reported. Monsters themselves will cycle through various appearances, and whether or not they are hostile is obscured; monsters cannot be named while hallucinating. This perception changes every time the screen is updated, so even selecting an object or monster and pressing {{kbd|;}} to see what it is appearing as will change it to something else. Hallucination abuses [[wisdom]] every 5 turns for its duration.

The set of names chosen for monsters while hallucinating includes a selection of various names from popular culture and entertainment, e.g. Barney the Dinosaur, King Kong, the Luggage, the Mother-in-Law, and The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal [[Hallucinatory monster|among others]]. The same applies for any mention of [[Hallucinatory currency|gold or zorkmids]]; similarly, hallucination replaces various standard messages with [[Hallucinatory messages|funny ones]], such as "You hear the studio audience applaud!" and "You are getting the munchies".

Monsters cannot hallucinate, and anything that would inflict hallucination upon you will leave a monster [[confusion#Monster confusion|confused]] instead.{{refsrc|src/mhitm.c|1088|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

Hallucination has a few strange qualities as well: if you are hallucinating and targeted by the [[touch of death]] [[monster spell]], instead of dying you "have an out of body experience". Note that this does ''not'' protect against [[Death (monster)|Death]]'s special deadly touch attack. Hallucination also has a {{frac|3|4}} chance of protecting you from any [[gaze attack]], including the [[floating eye]]'s paralyzing passive attack.{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|1990|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|2421|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

==Sources==
There are several means to induce hallucination:

* Eat the [[corpse]] or [[tin]] of a [[yellow mold]], [[violet fungus]] or any monster with a [[stunning]] attack. This lasts 200 (more) turns.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1110|nethack=3.6.6}}
* Be hit by the exploding attack of a [[black light]] while not blinded.  This lasts 10d12 (more) turns.{{refsrc|src/monst.c|965|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|2122|nethack=3.6.6}}
* [[Quaff]] a [[potion of hallucination]]. This lasts {{rn1|200|300}} (more) turns for a blessed potion, {{rn1|200|600}} (more) turns for an uncursed one, and {{rn1|200|900}} (more) turns for a cursed potion.{{refsrc|src/potion.c|639|nethack=3.6.6}}
* [[Apply]] a [[crystal ball]] and fail the [[intelligence]] check, which has a {{frac|5}} chance of "[zapping] your mind" and causing hallucination for 1&ndash;100 (more) turns.{{refsrc|src/detect.c|1129|nethack=3.6.6}}
* Apply a cursed [[unicorn horn]], which has a {{frac|2|13}} chance of inducing hallucination. This lasts {{rn1|90|10}} (more) turns.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|1942|nethack=3.6.6}}
* Trigger a [[container trap]], which has a {{frac|3|26}} chance of producing a "cloud of <random color> gas" (unless the container trap is harmless). This causes hallucination for {{rn1|5|16}} (more) turns, and also [[stun]]s you for {{rn1|7|16}} turns.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|4970|nethack=3.6.6}}

===Cures===
Hallucination can be cured by:
* Applying a [[noncursed]] unicorn horn
* Quaffing a potion of {{potion of|sickness|extra healing|or=1|full healing}}
* [[Prayer]] - hallucination is considered a minor problem
* Waiting for the effect to end on its own

Additionally, obtaining a source of [[hallucination resistance]] will suppress the effect for its duration. Currently, the only means of doing so is to [[wield]] [[Grayswandir]].

==Strategy==
Hallucination can be both funny and dangerous - as indicated previously, inability to distinguish a peaceful monster from a hostile one can quickly prove fatal. It is an easy and somewhat common mistake to lose track of which monster is your pet in a [[melee]] situation and accidentally kill it. You will also be unable to distinguish one hostile monster from another, making it difficult to prioritize targets. Additionally, [[engraving]] while hallucinating has a high chance to fail.

If you have quaffed a potion of hallucination and have no way to cure yourself, it is wise to keep away from your pet and/or large concentrations of peaceful monsters for the duration - areas such as [[Minetown]] (and the rest of the [[Gnomish Mines]] if [[dwarves]] and/or [[gnomes]] are peaceful towards you) are made rife with peril.<!-- You cannot name monsters to keep track which xorn to focus on or which unicorn you threw a gem you want to recover. Too corner-casey to include.-->

Once you have a noncursed [[unicorn horn]], hallucination is trivial to cure. Until then, you can avoid most causes of hallucination somewhat easily, with the exception of the typically-[[invisible]] black light. If you are aware of the light's approach (e.g. through [[see invisible]], [[monster detection]] or noticing your pet fighting something invisible), you can [[blindfold]] yourself so that the explosion has no effect. Failing that, hallucination from a black light only lasts for around 100 turns at most, so you can shut yourself in a room and wait it out.

===Identifying items and monsters===
It is a [[Bad Idea]] to eat an unidentified [[tin]] while hallucinating. Your perception of the smell will be affected, and you might eat [[cannibalism|meat of your race]] without realizing it. [[Spinach]] is still identified normally (except to distort the color of cursed spinach), and [[cockatrice]] meat always "smells like chicken" when hallucinating{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1619|nethack=3.6.0}} - all other contents cannot be readily distinguished until the tin is eaten, or else identified beforehand. You may also wish to refrain from quaffing unidentified potions until you recover from hallucination.

When monsters are nearby, you can still #[[chat]] to a hallucinatory monster to potentially identify it by its response - e.g., your pet [[little dog]] will yip or bark, regardless of whether it appears as a [[lichen]] or [[Archon]]. Thus, it can be useful to determine if a monster is tame or peaceful before attacking. A [[stethoscope]] will also correctly identify a monster's attributes while misidentifying the monster itself. If you kill a hallucinogen-distorted monster and step onto the square containing its corpse, the corpse will be accurately identified. 

==History==
Hallucination's effect on gaze attacks was introduced in [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

==Messages==
{{message|Oh wow! Everything <looks/feels> so cosmic!|You are hallucinating - "feels" is used if you are also [[blind]] at the time.}}
{{message|Oh wow! Great stuff!|You ate the corpse or tin of a monster and began hallucinating.}}
{{message|You have a peculiar feeling for a moment, then it passes.|You quaffed a potion of hallucination while you had hallucination resistance - the hallucination is applied and immediately suppressed by the property.}}
{{message|Far out! Everything is all cosmic again!|You were [[blind]], and either recovered or removed what was covering your eyes while hallucinating.}}
{{message|Everything <looks/feels> SO boring now.|You are no longer hallucinating - as with the first message, "feels" only occurs if you are also blind.}}
{{message|Your vision seems to flatten for a moment, but is normal now.|As above, but you had a source of hallucination resistance when it wore off.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]] and its variants, hallucination also distorts items you are standing on as well as your inventory, which makes it a far more hazardous ailment; additionally, you cannot name specific objects or object types until the effect wears off. In addition to the usual sources, eating a [[mushroom]] or a pink [[pill]] may also cause hallucination, and applying a [[medical kit]] can cure it. However, your [[deity]] will still consider it a minor problem for purposes of prayer.

Avoid quaffing a potion of hallucination without a remedy on hand such as a unicorn horn, set to an inventory letter that you can remember. Hallucination can be moderately useful as a way to [[bless]] items without breaking [[atheist]] conduct: asking a shopkeeper to [[Shopkeeper services#Uncursing|uncurse an item]] while hallucinating has a chance to bless it instead.

===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], hallucination causes the walls and floor of the dungeon to oscillate through a rainbow of colors each time the screen updates. As in SLASH'EM, it obscures the appearances of monsters, as well as items on the ground and in your inventory, and additionally hides object types. The intensity of the effect depends on the length of time you are hallucinating for, and will gradually affect fewer items and monsters as it comes closer to wearing off.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], hallucination affects object appearances as well as monsters; while your inventory is not affected, this does include prompts for looting [[container]]s with items and picking up multiple items from one square.

Hallucinating while eating a corpse that grants telepathy adds a point of [[insight]], while quaffing a cursed potion of hallucination reduces your insight by one point. As with SLASH'EM, requesting the item-uncursing service while hallucinating may also cause the item to be blessed instead.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], [[intelligent]] monsters can generate with a potion of hallucination as an [[offensive item]], and will throw it at you accordingly.

The '''unicorn horn''', sometimes called a '''unihorn''', is a [[weapon-tool]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is made of [[bone]].

==Generation==
Unicorn horns are not randomly generated and can only be obtained by killing a [[unicorn]], which leaves an uncursed +0 unicorn horn behind if killed in a way that leaves a [[corpse]]. Horns obtained from normal unicorns are considered [[magical item]]s.{{refsrc|src/zap.c|1405|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} [[Revive]]d or [[polymorph]]ed unicorns only have a 50% chance of leaving one upon death; the rest of the time, its horn will crumble to dust.{{refsrc|mon.c|322|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

[[Healer (player monster)|Healer]] [[player monster]]s have a {{frac|16}} to be generated with a unicorn horn in place of their melee weapon.

==Unicorn horn skill==
{{unicorn horn skill table}}

As a weapon, the unicorn horn has a dedicated weapon skill which only it uses. It is [[two-handed]] with +1 to-hit, and deals d12 damage to small and large monsters.

==Description==
As a tool, [[apply]]ing a noncursed unicorn horn can cure multiple negative status properties: 

* [[Blindness]], except from [[cream pie]]s and [[venom]]
* [[Deafness]]
* [[Confusion]]
* [[Hallucination]]
* [[Stun]]ning
* [[Sickness]]
* [[Nausea]] (from eating tripe/eggs)
* Lost [[attribute]] points

A unicorn horn cannot cure:

* [[Stoning]]
* [[Sliming]]
* [[Lycanthropy]]
* [[Wounded legs]]
* [[Amnesia]]

Applying an uncursed unicorn horn will fix (d(2d2) - 1) ailments, whilst a blessed one can heal (d(2d4) - 1) ailments.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|1997|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} A cursed unicorn horn will instead cause one or more of the applicable ailments listed above.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|1885|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} If you are wearing a [[ring of sustain ability]], a unicorn horn will not affect your attributes. When used by an [[intelligent]] monster with hands, noncursed unicorn horns are guaranteed to work on the first try; monsters will not use cursed unicorn horns.{{refsrc|src/muse.c|322|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}{{refsrc|src/muse.c|623|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

[[Dip]]ping a noncursed unicorn horn into certain potions can "cure" them as well: dipping one into a [[potion of sickness]] changes it to a [[potion of fruit juice]], and dipping one into a [[potion of blindness]], [[potion of confusion|confusion]], or [[potion of hallucination|hallucination]] will turn it into a [[potion of water]].

Unicorns can use their own horn, as can a player polymorphed into a unicorn via the [[Monster (command)|#monster]]; these produce the same effect as applying an uncursed unicorn horn.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes. Alternatives include [[Potion of restore ability|potions of restore ability]], the [[Spellbook of restore ability|restore ability spell]], [[prayer]], or [[gain ability]].

Cursed unicorn horns also no longer reduce attributes. Instead, they can induce nausea; currently, this gives no message.}}

==Strategy==
The unicorn horn is an important [[tool]] for almost any [[ascension kit]] - not only for its restorative abilities, but for its potential as a solid backup weapon and an aid in [[#Potion identification|potion identification]].

===Obtaining and maintaining horns===
{{main|Unicorn#Strategy}}
Unicorns that generate as hostile can be somewhat difficult foes to deal with early on, due to their movement patterns, speed and teleportation ability. Most such unicorns will be cross-aligned, although circumstances involving bones or [[polymorph]]ing can result in a hostile co-aligned unicorn; in either case, a thrown [[gem]] (ideally ones you suspect to be [[worthless glass]]) can pacify them.

Decently strong [[pet]]s can be used to run down a unicorn without incurring Luck penalties, though the pet will be in danger from counterattacks. Once a player has solid [[AC]], they can attempt to approach a hostile unicorn in melee or make use of tools such as [[invisibility]], [[displacement]], [[trap]]s, and even [[rebound]]s from spells and wands to dispatch them. As you kill more unicorns, it will be worth carrying a couple of backup horns with you and [[stash]]ing others in the event you need to retrieve a spare later.

If you informally identify a noncursed unicorn horn, especially from a bones pile, be sure to formally identify its [[beatitude]] as soon as possible so you will know if it becomes cursed later on. It is also advised to bless your unicorn horn the first chance you get; in addition to reliability, blessing it will provide extra protection against becoming cursed by hostile spellcasters, as with most items. Some players may consider wielding it during prayer - your god may bless your wielded weapon as a successful prayer boon.

===Monsters and pets===
[[Intelligent]] monsters with hands can use unicorn horns, including [[pet]]s. Such monsters will keep the first unicorn horn that they pick up in their inventory and use them immediately when [[confusion#Monster confusion|confused]] or [[stunned#Monsters|stunned]]; [[hallucination]] that affects monsters is treated as confusion instead.{{refsrc|src/mhitm.c|1167|version=NetHack 3.6.1|comment=[[Black light]]s are the only source of hallucination that can affect monsters.}} Monsters may optionally even wield it as a weapon.

Be sure to give applicable pets any spare unicorn horns you find - a black light sneaking up on you and confusing your pet is a potential worst-case scenario, leaving you immediately adjacent to danger with little warning unless they can use the horn to immediately cure it. Remember that tame monsters do not respect [[Elbereth]], but can be scared by other means.

===As a curative item===
A unicorn horn is among one of the most valuable general assets in terms of healing status effects - though even a blessed one is not 100% guaranteed to cure at least one status affliction on use, it is the most reliable such item accessible to any character and role. As a reusable cure, the unicorn horn can also help preserve magic power, [[prayer]], and other resources for later use. Most of what outmatches a blessed unicorn horn in reliability is dependent on the character in some manner, e.g., [[healing spell]]s such as [[cure sickness]] cast at 0% failure rate is reliant on the caster - [[Spellcasting|innate ability]], wisdom/intelligence, skill level, [[armor]] selection, etc.

The approximate cumulative odds of curing a single ailment are listed below; each status property counts as one ailment, and each lowered attribute is counted as a separate ailment.<ref>http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/tool-343.html#unicorn_horn</ref>

===As a weapon===
The unicorn horn is respectable as a weapon&mdash;it is a good lightweight, non-[[artifact]] option, especially for [[role]]s not restricted in the skill, and may occasionally even be a primary choice for certain characters such as [[Healer]]s. Unenchanted unicorn horns are especially handy as a backup against monsters such as [[rust monster]]s or [[disenchanter]]s that you do not want to risk your main weapon against.

The average damage calculations in the following table do not include bonuses from [[Skill|weapon skills]], [[strength]], or from using a [[blessed]] weapon against [[undead]] or [[demon]]s.

|-
| +7 unicorn horn
| <math>\frac{1+12}{2}+7=\bold{13.5}</math>
|}

===Potion identification===
Once you possess a noncursed unicorn horn, you can use one to identify potions as described above; if you have enough spare horns, you can also use them to dip-test for other potions. The [[potion of polymorph]] in particular requires certain considerations: players without a spare horn will want to use junk items to dip-test first and identify it beforehand. Dipping ammunition such as [[dart]]s and [[arrow]]s this way has the added benefit of potentially identifying potions of sickness (which will poison the item).

Players with spare unicorn horns can freely use them to dip-test for polymorph, and may receive another useful magical tool out of the deal. Those adhering to polypileless conduct will want to dip only identified [[wand of polymorph|wands]] and [[spellbook of polymorph|spellbooks of polymorph]] into potions to test for the potion - polymorphing an item this way breaks the conduct, and the wand and spellbook of polymorph specifically produce the message "Nothing happens" if dipped into a potion of polymorph.

===Polypiling===
Spare unicorn horns also make great fodder for [[polypiling]], as long as they did not come from a revived or polymorphed unicorn. However, polypiling with many horns and other bone items in a single pile may generate a [[skeleton]]; this is best avoided by spreading them between the piles prior to polymorphing.

===Cursed unicorn horns===
A unicorn horn found in a [[bones]] pile is very likely to be cursed, and ideally should not be used until you can #[[dip]] it in [[holy water]], find an [[altar]] or otherwise test its beatitude. With some luck, you may be able to liberate any spare ones the former character had from a container(s) within the pile; you can also use a noncursed [[scroll of remove curse]] or cast [[spell of remove curse|the spell]] in order to restore the horn. Otherwise, you can group it with the other bones items you wish to uncurse or blank and zap a [[wand of cancellation]] at the pile.

If your only unicorn horn is cursed and you lack a source of curse removal or spare horns, you can wield it and pray after it welds to your hands &ndash; having no free hands counts as a major trouble, and praying successfully will uncurse the horn. However, be absolutely sure that you are in good standing with your god beforehand!

Cursed unicorn horns may be useful as a source of status afflictions - negative effects from a cursed unicorn horn can be cured without too much trouble by a non-cursed one, and spare non-cursed unicorn horns are not hard to obtain once you and/or your pet are capable of reliably killing unicorns. In particular, cursed unicorn horns are a source of [[confusion]] that preserves the [[illiterate]] [[conduct]] for purposes such as [[throne farming]] - especially if you are playing a role with no starting spells.

In addition to the standard methods of cursing items, you can also curse a unicorn horn without breaking any conducts by dipping it in a [[fountain]] - this has a {{frac|30}} chance of cursing the dipped item.

==History==
The unicorn horn is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.6]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Unicorn}}
{{wikipedia}}
The unicorn's horn, also known as an "alicorn", is a legendary object in antiquity-era folktalkes - many healing powers and curative qualities were attributed to it that made it one of the most expensive and reputable remedies during Renaissance times, which is the primary reason that unicorns were such sought-after creatures. Belief in the power of the alicorn persisted until the 16th century, when it was discovered that the horn in truth was that of the [[Wikipedia:Narwhal|narwhal]], and was actually an extended tooth formed in the mouth of males and some females of the species. 

Unicorn horns were given as diplomatic gifts, and horn chips and dust could be purchased at apothecaries as universal antidotes until the 18th century. Sections of horns were displayed in cabinets of curiosities, and they were used to create sceptres and other royal objects across European history. The unicorn horn has been mentioned in various fantasy works, role-playing games, and video games, which make use of its legendary symbolism.

==Messages==
===Unicorns===
{{message|The tip of the <color> unicorn's horn glows!|A unicorn cured a status problem using its horn.}}
{{message|The <color> unicorn's recently regrown horn crumbles to dust.|A revived unicorn died, but did not drop a unicorn horn.}}

===Non-cursed unicorn horns===
{{message|Nothing happens.|You have no conditions that the unicorn horn can fix.}}
{{message|Nothing seems to happen.|You have a condition that could be fixed by the horn, but it was not cured.}}
{{message|This makes you feel great!|You had [[attribute]] points restored, and you have no other conditions.}}
{{message|This makes you feel better!|You had attribute points restored, but you still have other conditions (not necessarily ones that the horn can cure).}}
{{message|What a relief!|The unicorn horn cured you of sickness.}}

===Cursed unicorn horns===
{{message|You feel deathly sick.|You became [[ill]]; you have between 20 and (19+Con) turns left to live.}}
{{message|You feel <much/even> worse.|You were already ill; your turns to live have been reduced to 1/3 of their value.}}
{{message|A cloud of darkness falls upon you.|You were [[blind]]ed.}}
{{message|You suddenly feel confused.|You became [[confused]].}}
{{message|You stagger...|You became [[stunned]].}}
{{message|Oh wow! Everything looks so cosmic!|You started [[hallucinating]].}}
{{message|You are unable to hear anything.|You became [[deaf]]. This outcome is half as likely as the others.}}

==Variants==
Many variants remove or weaken the unicorn horn's ability to restore attributes in order to lower reliance on the item and make other options for restoring stats more viable.

Also, in the [[Advent calendar]] patch and variants that incorporate it, a unicorn horn is one of the possible Christmas presents that may be found in room 24, and may appear very rarely in any of the other rooms.

=== SLASH'EM ===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the probability of a unicorn horn curing ailments is changed. Blessed horns try to fix all problems, each with the given probability, and uncursed horns try to fix a single problem, with the same probability.<ref>http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/slashem/tools.html</ref>

{|class="prettytable"
!Enchantment !! Chance
|-
|| 0 or less || 30%
|-
|| 1 || 40%
|-
|| 2 || 50%
|-
|| 3 || 60%
|-
|| 4 || 70%
|-
|| 5 || 80%
|-
|| 6 or more || 90%
|}

SLASH'EM also adds an artifact unicorn horn, [[Nighthorn]]. It is [[lawful]] and confers [[reflection]] when wielded, and is obtained by killing [[Nightmare]] at the end of the [[Lawful Quest]].

=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]], a unicorn horn does ''not'' restore lost attribute points.<ref>http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unnethack/wiki/Items</ref> As a result, the potion of restore ability and [[spellbook of restore ability]] are much more useful.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], unicorn horns are one-handed weapons and do not restore lost attribute points. The [[ancient of corruption]] has a headbutt attack that can inflict various status conditions by replicating the effects of applying a cursed horn.

A blessed [[tin]] of [[jubjub bird]] meat is an item gives 600 nutrition and acts as a single-use unicorn horn.

[[Binder (dNetHack role)|Binders]] that contact and bind the spirit of [[Echidna]] are granted the unicorn horn skill.

=== FIQHack ===
In [[FIQHack]], unicorn horns do not affect attributes in any way. In addition, uncursed unicorn horns are far less reliable, only having a 20% of curing an ailment per use; blessed unicorns horns will always cure all applicable ailments, but have a 10% chance of becoming uncursed afterward.

=== xNetHack ===
In [[xNetHack]], unicorn horns do not restore lost attribute points; they also deal less damage when used as weapons (1d8/1d10), but are now one-handed as in dNetHack. A unicorn horn wielded in your main hand is passively auto-applied every turn if you are not wearing [[gloves]], curing status problems without using an action.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], unicorn horns function as they do in xNetHack, minus the passive auto-application.

'''Croesus''', {{monsym|croesus}}, is a notable [[monster]] in ''[[NetHack]]''. He is the rich owner of [[Fort Ludios]] and all the [[vault]]s seen in the dungeon, and has many [[guard]]s and [[Yendorian Army]] soldiers on his payroll.

If you encounter a guard while inside one of the vaults, you can enter Croesus in the prompt when the guard asks for your name, and you will be left alone until the next one checks in; the name can also be spelled '''Kroisos''' or '''Creosote'''. This incurs a -1 [[alignment]] penalty for lawful [[player]] characters, ''unless'' it is also their actual name. Answering with this name after killing the real Croesus will instead make the guard hostile. (''"Back from the dead, are you? I'll remedy that!"'')

==Generation==
Croesus resides in a [[throne room]] on the right half of Fort Ludios, occupying the throne a few squares away from the secret door.{{refsrc|dat/knox.des|40|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} He [[Monster starting inventory|will always generate with]] a [[two-handed sword]].{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1308|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} While he generates asleep like other throne room monsters, the alarms in Fort Ludios will always wake him up immediately.

==Strategy==
Characters that are ready for the [[Castle]] should be able to deal with him with some caution. While Croesus lacks any resistances and has only one weapon attack, he can deal enough damage to wipe out under-leveled or poorly armored characters in a few swings. Dispatching him at a distance is a good idea for mid-level characters, especially since he has no resistances - a [[wand of sleep]] will render him much easier to dispose of, although his 40 [[monster magic resistance|MR]] and decent AC of 0 can make this difficult.

You can freely shoot wands and projectiles at Croesus from across Fort Ludios' [[moat]] and chip him down - he can only retaliate if he spawns with his own attack wand or picks one up (usually from another monster killed by the ranged assault), and poses no more danger in this regard than the multiple soldiers you will have dealt with in order to reach him. Using a source of [[conflict]] can turn the throne room denizens against each other, which is more than likely to get him killed - at worst, he will be weakened enough that you can mop him and the other survivors up at your leisure.

If you use a [[boulder]] (e.g. from a [[scroll of earth]] or any [[giants]] on the level) or source of cold (e.g. [[wand of cold]] or a [[frost horn]]), you can cross the moat and take the fight to Croesus, though you must also contend with the throne room monsters; remember that he can [[see invisible]], and like all [[human (monster attribute)|humans]] he does not respect [[Elbereth]]. Alternately, you can wait for him to step onto newly-created [[ice]], then use a fire-based attack (e.g. [[wand of fire]]) to melt it and drown him. Even a low-level character can defeat Croesus this way - however, he has 15 [[speed]] and may be able to cross the moat before you can melt the ice.

==History==
Croesus first appears in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Croesus}}
As indicated by the encyclopedia entry, Croesus (Greek ''Kroisos'') is named for a Lydian king renowned for his wealth. Creosote is a similarly wealthy character that appears in ''[[Discworld]]'', and is named after the same figure.

==Variants==
Variants that use the [[object materials]] system may give Croesus [[gold (material)|gold]] armor and weapons.

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Croesus is nearly the same as in vanilla - of note is that hitting him with a [[potion of amnesia]] will produce [[YAFM]], but otherwise has no effect on him.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Croesus will always generate with a set of gold body armor, helm and boots, as well as a gold two-handed sword. The body armor will be either [[plate mail]] or [[banded mail]], the helm will be either a standard [[helmet]] or a [[dwarvish helm]], and the boots will either be [[kicking boots]] or [[dwarvish boots]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L1207 EvilHack 0.7 src/makemon.c, line 1207]</ref>

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], Croesus generates with a gold two-handed sword and gold body armor - the armor has a {{frac|1|8}} to be plate mail, and will otherwise be [[chain mail]].<ref>[https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack/blob/7.0-savebreaking/src/makemon.c#L250 xNetHack 0.7 src/makemon.c, line 250]</ref>

==Encyclopaedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Croesus (in Greek: Kroisos), the wealthy last king of Lydia;
his empire was destroyed when he attacked Cyrus in 549, after
the Oracle of Delphi (q.v.) had told him:  "if you attack the
Persians, you will destroy a mighty empire".  Herodotus
relates of his legendary conversation with Solon of Athens,
who impressed upon him that being rich does not imply being
happy and that no one should be considered fortunate before
his death.

'''Juiblex''' (often mistakenly referred to as '''Jubilex''') is a [[demon lord]]. [[Juiblex's swamp|Juiblex's lair]] is a swamp. Juiblex has [[infravision]] and can [[engulf]] players and render them [[ill]], as well as spitting acid [[venom]]. 

== Generation ==
If he is not generated elsewhere in a game, e.g. via [[bones]], Juiblex is guaranteed to appear at the center of his swamp. There is a 1/260 chance that a [[water demon]] may summon him or [[Yeenoghu]], making it possible for him to appear quite early in the game and obliterate a weak character if they try [[fountain]] [[dipping]] or [[quaffing]]. He can also be summoned by [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing creatures of own race|same race sacrifice]], and will be generated as peaceful if you are [[chaotic]].

==Strategy==
Like other demon lords, Juiblex is [[covetous]] and will [[teleport]] to meet you. Because of his infravision, he can see you across his swamp, and will typically confront you a few turns after entering the level, as soon as he can get a turn. Dealing with him in a straight fight is tedious, despite his incredibly low speed; on top of his low AC of -7 and the usual troubles with covetous characters, his illness-inducing engulfing attack can and will kill you shortly unless you can cure it with a [[eucalyptus leaf]] or a [[unicorn horn]]. You will ''then'' have to escape his grasp before becoming ill again, which may give him time to teleport away or else re-engulf you. 

Otherwise, the most common strategy uses a preferably [[blessed]] unicorn horn, a [[wand of digging]], and a decent weapon of any kind: when he engulfs you, zapping the wand will tear through him and drop his HP to 1, like any non-[[whirly]] [[engulfing]] monster. Cure the illness as soon as possible, especially once you have successfully disposed of him; if you are having trouble hitting due to his naturally low AC of -7, you can allow him to re-engulf you for a guaranteed hit. If you do so, '''do not forget''' to cure your illness again.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Juiblex now only loses half of his HP when hit with digging magic from inside.}}

As one of the demon lords who can be summoned, Juiblex can be made peaceful if a chaotic player sacrifices his own race on an aligned [[altar]]. If this occurs, it may be worth attacking him as soon as you are prepared for the relatively large XP reward, with comparatively minimal risk and only the three required items above.

===Juiblex express===
If you allow Juiblex to engulf you, and then damage him a bit, he'll teleport to the up [[staircase]] with you inside of him. This allows easy traversal of his no-teleport [[swamp]] lair, especially when coming up from the [[Sanctum]] with the [[Amulet of Yendor]]. With regular curing of the illness and attention to your HP, it may be possible to continue the Juiblex Express up to dungeon level one.

===Extinctionism===
Juiblex presents a difficult problem for [[extinctionist]]s. He cannot be [[stoned]], so repeated stoning and unstoning will not work unlike most other unique monsters. He will never leave a [[corpse]], so [[revive|revival]] also fails.

Life-saved re-kills do not count toward the [[Options#showborn|kill counter]], and even those take some effort. Extinctionists looking to add Juiblex to their list will have to drop an [[amulet of life saving]] into his belly while [[engulf]]ed. Then, zap a wand of {{wand of|slow monster|or=1|speed monster}} (or the {{spell of|slow monster}} spell) at him to make him put it on. He will not pick up an amulet by normal means, but can be generated with one.

== Variants ==

=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]], zapping a wand of digging to escape Juiblex's engulfing will only reduce his HP to half its current value, instead of bringing it down to one.

==Origin==

Juiblex is an original creation of [[Dungeons and Dragons]]. As the encyclopedia says, he is a slime-like being.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
Little is known about the Faceless Lord, even the correct spelling of his name.  He does not have a physical form as we know it, and those who have peered into his realm claim he is a slime-like creature who swallows other creatures alive, spits acidic secretions, and causes disease in his victims which can be almost instantly fatal.

'''Demogorgon''' is the most difficult of the [[demon prince]]s and perhaps the most difficult [[monster]] overall to appear in ''[[NetHack]]''.

Demogorgon possesses [[infravision]], [[see invisible]] and [[flight]], and like all demon lords and princes he is [[covetous]]. He can cast spells and has a [[drain life (monster attack)|life-draining]] sting, along with two [[disease]]-inducing claw attacks; if the first claw attack hits, the second one will instead [[stun]] you upon a successful hit.

==Generation==
Demogorgon is one of three demon princes not to have his own lair (the other two being [[Geryon]] and [[Dispater]]), and therefore he only appears via [[demon summoning]] or the [[summon nasties]] monster spell. He can be summoned directly by [[Orcus]], [[Juiblex]], or [[Yeenoghu]], and hence indirectly by any demon that can summon one of these demon lords; he may also be rarely generated by any spellcasting monster that casts [[summon nasties]] within [[Gehennom]], including the [[Wizard of Yendor]].

==Strategy==
The 'safest' approach to Demogorgon is not to meet him in the first place: since Orcus, Juiblex and Yeenoghu are the most likely to summon Demogorgon, it is best to kill them as expeditiously as possible. If you get bogged down fighting lesser threats, you are giving Demogorgon an opportunity to arrive every turn.

Conversely, if you ''want'' to fight Demogorgon for bragging rights, your best option is to take precautions against Orcus' [[wand of death]] and let him spend all the time he wants ineffectively zapping you with it; he will resort to his spells afterward and eventually summon Demogorgon. If Yeenoghu is the one to summon Demogorgon, you may have a hard time avoiding [[confusion]] and stunning; this leaves you open to further status afflictions - including Demo's dreaded [[disease]] attack - if you try to attack or cure the afflictions.

The only "surefire" way to survive Demogorgon is to be as prepared as you can. Just as you carry an [[escape item]] for emergencies, work out your "Demogorgon Kit" and carry it in your inventory when you enter Gehennom. It is preferable to be [[very fast]] and unencumbered, as Demogorgon can only be outsped by fast or very fast characters who are unburdened. The ability to cure diseases is critical, as is having a solid offense ''and'' a means of escape; a [[scroll of scare monster]] in a [[container]] is very helpful, especially since Demogorgon is liable to [[Curse items|curse your items]]. Be aware that not even a blessed [[unicorn horn]] is perfectly reliable for curing sickness — the safest items are [[holy water]], a blessed potion of {{of|potion|healing|extra healing|full healing}}, and the {{spell of|cure sickness}} spell if you can get it to a 0% failure rate.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Monsters will not use wands against you if they discover you are immune to their effects, meaning that Orcus will stop using his wand of death if you prove sufficiently immune. Additionally, a scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any [[unique]] monster.}}

===Escaping Demogorgon===
If Demogorgon ''does'' appear and you did not plan on fighting him, it is usually best to leave the level immediately - [[teleport]] to the [[staircase]], quaff a cursed [[potion of gain level]], zap a [[wand of digging]] downwards, etc. As always, discretion is the better part of valor. Beware that Demogorgon will [[follow]] you to another level if standing next to you; you can gain the necessary distance by teleporting him, [[paralyzing]] him, being fast enough, damaging him so that he teleports, etc.

If this happens while you have the [[Amulet of Yendor]], throwing it away is something of a last resort - Demogorgon will give you a turn or two by teleporting to it to pick it up, but you are committing to fighting him at some later point if you successfully escape. You can then use the breathing space to reassess, re-equip, and move back in on your own terms.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You can no longer teleport to the stairs if Demogorgon is on the same level in Gehennom. Level teleportation, branchporting or using a cursed potion of gain level will still work.}}

===Fighting Demogorgon===
Most strategies for tackling Demogorgon involve getting to the upstairs before he can; the usual strategies for stopping covetous monsters from escaping apply here. If you manage to encounter him outside of Gehennom, you can burn [[Elbereth]] to scare him off and prevent him from attacking, though you won't be able to attack him in return. You can also make use of a scroll of scare monster, which lets you attack him while standing on it and works in Gehennom. Additionally, you can keep him at a distance using a non-cursed [[scroll of earth]] and a non-[[force bolt]] ranged attack - remember that most spells are rendered impractical against him due to his extremely high [[monster magic resistance]].

If you choose to engage him in melee, make sure you possess [[magic resistance]], and that your weapon is blessed and well-enchanted in order to handle Demogorgon's base &minus;8 [[AC]] and item-cursing spells - the more time you spend trying to finish him off, the more likely he is to curse something vital or else render you ill. Demogorgon's first disease attack leaves you with between 20 and (19 + [[constitution]]) turns to live, which is a fairly comfortable margin for healing yourself: however, each subsequent disease attack will reduce your remaining turns to live by roughly {{frac|2|3}}, though they will stun you instead if both disease attacks hit in one round. There is no way to know the exact value of your turns-to-live counter if you are diseased, so you should act as if the worst case were true in every circumstance.

Demogorgon is not immune to [[stoning]] or [[disintegration]], so you can kill him via those methods - if you have any [[wish]]es left, a partly eaten [[chickatrice]] [[corpse]] may be worthwhile. One approach that is more reliable is to [[polymorph]] into a female cockatrice and lay some [[eggs]] ahead of time to use as petrification grenades.

====Jousting Demogorgon====
If you are a [[Knight]] on a [[steed]] with Expert [[skill]] in [[lance]] and high [[Luck]] to minimize odds of breakage, you may be able to [[joust]] Demogorgon to death before he gets a chance to teleport to the stairs, and may even be able to prevent his melee attacks if you're lucky. If he does get away, you can use a unicorn horn and try again.

===Other strategies===
The [http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/demogorgon_faq.html Demogorgon FAQ] written by Kate Nepveu covers a lot of relevant strategies for understanding and dealing with Demogorgon; note that it is based on [[NetHack 3.4.0]], and at least some of the information will be dated.

==History==
The effect of Demogorgon's second disease attack that stuns an-already deathly ill player was added in NetHack 3.4.0.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Demogorgon}}
Demogorgon is a demon lord and lesser deity in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which in turn derived him from a powerful demon and supposed pagan god invented by Antiquity-era Christian authors. In ''Dungeons & Dragons'', Demogorgon is known as ''the'' Prince of Demons, and appears as an 18-foot (5.5m), vaguely humanoid/reptilian demon with two mandrill heads, two long reptilian necks and two tentacles for arms. His image graces the front cover of ''Monster Manual 2'' in the 4th edition.

Each of Demogorgon's heads have its own name and personality that are constantly at war with each other, even as Demogorgon fights to maintain the title of Prince of Demons - among the other demons lords striving for the title is his deeply-hated rival Orcus, which may be ironic to ''NetHack'' players who often encounter Demogorgon through him. Demogorgon's signature abilities include life-draining stings with his whip-like tail, as well as withering diseases inflicted by his tentacles that caused living victims to rot away, and he is extremely resistant to magic. Though he has a reputation for brute strength, Demogorgon is also extremely creative and an accomplished spellcaster.

Demogorgon's cult is smaller than that of most "true" deities, while dwarfing those of most fiends; he prefers to avoid direct involvement in conflicts, instead aiding his servants through magic. 

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Demogorgon has his own [[Demogorgon's lair (SLASH'EM)|lair]] somewhere between the second and sixth levels of Gehennom, guaranteeing that you will encounter him. Like other demon lord lairs, Demogorgon's lair is no-teleport; Demogorgon still can teleport to the staircase and to you, as covetous monsters usually do.

Keep in mind that the behavior of unicorn horns is changed in SLASH'EM, making them far less reliable without [[enchantment|enchanting]] them; come prepared with a highly enchanted horn to deal with the sickening attack.

SLASH'EM [[Monk]]s can easily kill him using the [[pummel]] technique.

===GruntHack===
In [[GruntHack]], Demogorgon also has a lair that you are guaranteed to encounter; it is typically only one or two levels before the [[vibrating square]] level. Demogorgon also does not respect Elbereth.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], Demogorgon does not respect Elbereth. He sometimes appears in his own lair in Gehennom, which takes the form of a small self-contained maze surrounded by a moat of ice; this lair is not guaranteed as in some other variants.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Demogorgon is one of the three demon princes whose lair can appear as [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Branches/Brine Flats#Demogorgon's palace|the third Abyss level]]. He will generate within the central room of his palace, surrounded by closed drawbridges and accompanied by two [[fallen angel]]s, a [[shayateen]] and a [[Nessian pit fiend]]. Demogorgon is by far the most dangerous monster in the game - the first time he appears in a game, his presence is announced by a full-screen message. '''Avoid him at all costs, if at all possible.'''

He is even stronger and faster than his vanilla incarnation, with 18 speed and an effective -26 AC: his attacks include a single-target gaze that can drain levels and paralyze you, and allows him to steal items if both land; his disease attacks deal far more damage and can still stun you, and should both of them land he follows with a body armor-rending 'claw' attack; and finally, he has a pair of [[Monster spell#Mage spells|mage spell]] attacks that both use weaker dice compared to his singular one in vanilla, but are no less likely to be deadly.

The rending claw attack heavily damages the enchantment of body armor that it hits and will destroy them if they reach a negative enchantment equal to their combined AC + DR, unless they are [[artifact]]s - unlike other rending or flaying attacks, if you do not have body armor, Demogorgon will instead [[instadeath|rend through you]]. The single-target ranged gaze is perfect for rooting a target in place, and Demogorgon will use it as soon as he possibly can - [[free action]] can prevent the paralysis effect, but he can still drain levels and steal items from you, likely including vital armor and cures for illness. As a result, the best defense by far is to [[blind]] yourself within one turn of him appearing - if you are caught by the paralyzing gaze, from there it generally becomes a question of whether you will be torn apart by his claw attacks before you succumb to disease.

Despite all of the above, Demogorgon is far from invincible: more than a few truly daring skilled players have been able to defeat him and even ascend afterward - one such strategy involves wages of sloth.<!--Absolute Fool's Guide to Killing Demo may or may not happen, don't hold your breath tho--> Even so, this requires you to prepare and devote resources specifically for the possibility of encountering him during a given game - Demogorgon can appear unexpectedly via gating on ''another'' level, potentially rendering vital portions of your strategy less effective (or even useless!) regardless of whether you planned to fight him. Even if you blind yourself and avoid near-instantaneous death in this instance, it is still highly recommended that you put space between you and him and escape as soon as possible, e.g. with a cursed potion of gain level.

Thankfully, if Demogorgon's lair generates it is more than possible to sneak through without having to confront the Prince of Demons - this is perhaps the easiest way to deal with him in a game. Demogorgon is far from the only threat in his lair, naturally: his fortress is also home to particularly vicious monsters, including hostile casters such as [[demilich]]es, an [[Archon]] and even another demon ruler in the statue-trapped [[Shaktari]]. Such monsters may not only prove difficult and even deadly on their own, but may also attract his attention (e.g., via the [[aggravate]] [[monster spell]]).

===EvilHack===
In EvilHack, Demogorgon is one of the four third-tier demon princes whose lair can appear in Gehennom.

His non-spellcasting attacks use one more hitdie (e.g. his life-draining sting is 2d4 instead of 1d4), and he now has [[psychic resistance]] as well, but he is otherwise very similar to his appearance in vanilla ''NetHack''.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
A terrible deity, whose very name was capable of producing the most horrible effects.  He is first mentioned by the 4th-century Christian writer, Lactantius, who in doing so broke with the superstition that the very reference to Demogorgon by name brought death and disaster.
 		[ Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ]

Demogorgon, the prince of demons, wallows in filth and can spread a quickly fatal illness to his victims while rending them. He is a mighty spellcaster, and he can drain the life of mortals with a touch of his tail.

'''Orcus''', {{monsym|orcus}}, is one of the [[demon prince]]s that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. He is tied for the fifth-highest [[monster difficulty]] with [[Geryon]], and has the seventh-highest [[Monsters (by experience)|base experience]] in the game.

Orcus possesses [[infravision]], [[see invisible]] and [[flight]], and like all demon lords and princes he is [[covetous]]. Orcus has a weapon attack, two claw attacks, a clerical spell attack, and a [[poison]] sting; as a [[chaotic]] demon prince, he cannot be [[bribe]]d.

==Generation==
Orcus is guaranteed to appear in [[Gehennom]], where he is found residing on the down [[stair]] of his self-named lair, [[Orcus-town]]. He will always generate with a [[wand of death]].

==Strategy==
For characters without [[magic resistance]], Orcus poses a dual threat of [[instadeath|instant death]] through both his wand and the [[touch of death]] spell; [[reflection]] can deflect rays from the former, but cannot protect against the latter. For any character ''with'' magic resistance, the main priority is often relieving Orcus of his wand without destroying it or letting him waste several charges, especially if you plan to use it against non-immune threats like the [[Wizard of Yendor]]. Orcus can also use his melee attack and the [[summon nasties]] spell to [[Demons#Demons summoning demons|summon]] either [[Demogorgon]] or [[Yeenoghu]] (who can also summon Demogorgon) - the possibility of Demogorgon arriving is often the prime motivator to kill Orcus as fast as possible in either case, or else avoid fighting him directly in melee.

While skipping Orcus is technically possible, it is more ideal to dispose of him if at all possible. If you cannot avoid fighting him directly, then your options to block the up [[stair]] and prevent him escaping are as follows: 

* As with most covetous monsters, use the down stair in Orcus-town when Orcus is adjacent to you; the up stair is always on the opposite end of the map, and the level is [[no-teleport]]. This is most easily arranged by digging down upon reaching the level, then taking the up stair - it is also easier if you chose to [[Gehennom mapping#Demon mapping|map Gehennom starting from the bottom]].
* Move a [[boulder]], e.g. from a [[scroll of earth]], onto the square stair - this will not prevent him teleporting near it, but stops him from traveling upward. It is therefore best combined with the next listed approach:
* Create a [[boulder fort]] on or near the stair, then get the attention of Orcus, e.g. with a cursed [[potion of invisibility]]; [[missile]] weapons are the most ideal offense for this strategy, as spells and wands will be blunted by [[Magic resistance (monster)|his MR score]] of 85.

Orcus is not immune to [[stoning]] or [[disintegration]] - hitting him with a [[footrice]] [[corpse]] or [[egg]] will instantly kill him, and Orcus may summon a cockatrice alongside other nasties; the [[breath]] attack of a [[black dragon]] will also wipe him out instantly if you can get him in the line of fire, and may be best done with a [[tame]] black dragon. Another option is to wield a [[potion of paralysis]] and strike with it while wearing a [[ring of free action]], then try to finish Orcus as quickly as possible; though he has a low 9 [[speed]], this may likely require multiple potions. Finally, a [[Knight]] on a [[steed]] with high [[Luck]] and Expert [[skill]] in [[lance]] can potentially [[joust]] Orcus to death, with the [[stun]] from jousting preventing him getting away.

==History==
Orcus was introduced with the other demon lords and princes in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
Orcus is derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which takes the name and general association with undeath from [[Orcus (god)|the god]] whose domain was the Estrucan and later Roman underworld, and acted as a punisher of broken oaths. As with Hades, Orcus's name was also used for the underworld itself; in later Roman tradition, he was conflated with Dis Pater (who inspired the [[Dispater]] of ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Like many other deities associated with death and the underworld, his name was used for demons and other underworld beings such as the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' demon prince.

Orcus is among the most well-known and mighty demon princes of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' settings - he physically appears as a fat and immense humanoid demon anywhere between 15-20 ft (4.6-6.1 m) in size, with the horned, tusked and decayed skull of a ram for a head; Orcus also has the legs and hooves of a goat, the wings of a bat, and a long and spiny poison-tipped tail. Orcus is immune to His most iconic [[artifact]] by far is the "Wand of Orcus": a skull-topped wand with the power to slay any living being, represented by the literal wand of death he holds in ''NetHack''.

As Prince of the Undead, Orcus seeks to extinguish life throughout all universes, and is at constant war for the Abyss with rivals such as Demogorgon; among the ranks of his armies and followers are [[zombie]]s, [[vampire]]s and [[shade]]s (referred to as shadows). Orcus is one of the Abyssal powers most often worshipped as a deity, and has attained actual divinity once previously: after doing so, he eventually abandoned the war for the Abyss and become lazy and careless, culminating in his death at the hands of the ambitious drow demi-goddess, Kiaransalee. Despite her efforts, Orcus was eventually resurrected by one of his foremost high priests in a blasphemous ritual and took back his wand and the title of Prince of the Undead once more, resuming his war for the Abyss.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], while Orcus is still capable of summoning Demogorgon, each demon lord and prince has their own lair within Gehennom - as a result, you will eventually face Demogorgon yourself sooner or later.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], Orcus is one of the demon princes whose lair can appear as the second Abyss level.

Orcus is similar to his vanilla incarnation, but with a few notable differences: his MR score is boosted even further to 99, rendering several spells and wands all but useless against him, and he favors the [[raise dead]] monster spell when casting in combat. Furthermore, the wand of death he always generates with is now a huge-sized intelligent chaotic artifact that he uses as a melee weapon: it drains levels on hit as a wand and a weapon and uses the [[mace]] skill in melee; the Wand also cannot be wrested or broken, can be recharged indefinitely, and is even capable of zapping death rays without any charges depending on its [[invoke]] timer.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Orcus is always among the four demon lords and princes whose lair you encounter in Gehennom; the other three are chosen from a set pool of lairs for each tier. Orcus-town is most likely to be the third demon ruler lair in order of appearance.

The Wand of Orcus is an artifact always generated in his possession, and cannot be [[wish]]ed for since it is guaranteed to appear in every game. Its [[base item]] is an ornate [[gemstone]] [[rod]], and it has +1d5 to-hit and +1d6 damage bonuses. Living monsters hit by the Wand will have their maximum hit points drained, and those without magic resistance have a small chance to be killed outright. Moreover, the Wand of Orcus can never be picked up by the player in EvilHack and will harm them if they try; only another NPC demon is capable of even touching the Wand.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Orcus, Prince of the Undead, has a ram's head and a poison
stinger.  He is most feared, though, for his powerful magic
abilities.  His wand causes death to those he chooses.

'''Yeenoghu''', {{monsym|yeenoghu}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[NetHack]]. He is one of the [[demon lord]]s.

==Generation==
Yeenoghu [[monster starting inventory|is always generated with]] a [[flail]]. 

Yeenoghu is one of the two named demons that can be summoned with same-race [[sacrifice]]. If the player is [[lawful]] or [[neutral]] when performing this type of sacrifice, Yeenoghu will be hostile when summoned; if the player is [[chaotic]], they will be peaceful. There is also a {{frac|260}} chance that a [[water demon]] may [[gate]] in Yeenoghu or [[Juiblex]].

==Strategy==
Yeenoghu can deal out tremendous physical damage if you lack [[free action]] and [[MC3]]; his melee attacks can also gate in other [[major demon]]s, and he can zap you with [[magic missile]]s as well, meaning he is immune to them and [[wand of death|death rays]] on top of his high [[monster magic resistance]]. However, Yeenoghu is not generally a problem if you are prepared for him.

Like other demon princes, Yeenoghu is [[covetous]] and will teleport next to you to deliver melee attacks and fire magic missiles. When at low health, he will teleport to the upstair tile to regenerate, and will escape up them if approached too closely; the usual strategies for covetous monsters apply, including obstructing the upstair or else luring him to a floor with a blocked upstair. As he is able to summon [[Demogorgon]] directly, dispatching him quickly is advised.

Yeenoghu respects [[Elbereth]]; however, Elbereth does not work in [[Gehennom]], where Yeenoghu is most likely to be encountered. Even if you encounter him outside Gehennom (e.g. via water demon or a non-Gehennom [[bones]]), you may be better off escaping and avoiding the floor entirely if somehow possible unless your character is sufficiently prepared. If you can take the fight to him, then remember that you cannot attack him while on an Elbereth, either; on top of this, Yeenoghu's confusing gaze will complicate your attempts to engrave, and his tendency to teleport after you at the first opportunity usually means you will have to lure him to a pre-engraved Elbereth elsewhere.

==History==
Yeenoghu first appears in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==="A ludicrous bug"===
Yeenoghu is the subject of one of the longest-running bugs in NetHack history. In [[NetHack 3.1.0]], the [[Riders]] were introduced. The code that handles their special attacks comes right after that which handles Yeenoghu's [[confusion]] attack.{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1474}} Early versions had this code inserted carelessly; consequently, after Yeenoghu used his confusion attack, execution would proceed into the section that handles [[Death (monster)|Death]]'s touch:{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1485}}

 Yeenoghu reaches out with its deadly touch.--More--
 Do you want your possessions identified? [yn]

A comment at the end of Yeenoghu's section read:

<syntaxhighlight lang="c">/* fall through to next case */</syntaxhighlight>

Contemporary source-divers thought from this that the behavior was deliberate; thus, for many years the bug was never reported.

[[Pat Rankin]] of the [[DevTeam]] was made aware of this property in a [[rec.games.roguelike.nethack]] discussion, and called it "a ludicrous bug";<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/ae8d21ca5c42d00a/128792c7be721eb9?lnk=st&q=&rnum=2#128792c7be721eb9 Pat Rankin, "Re: YASQ: Yeenoghu". rec.games.roguelike.nethack, April 9, 2001.]</ref> the then-current version was [[NetHack 3.3.1]], and the illicit death touch bug was finally fixed in time for [[NetHack 3.4.0]].

[[Umber hulk]]s were not affected, because their confusion attack is handled in a different part of the code.{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1948}}

These source excerpts might make clear the origin of the bug. Here is src/mhitu.c lines 999-1012 from [[NetHack 3.0.0]], which was before the [[Riders]] existed:

<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
#ifdef HARD /* a non-gaze AD_CONF exists only for one of the demons */
            case AD_CONF:
                hitmsg(mtmp,mattk->aatyp);
                if(!mtmp->mcan && !rn2(4) && !mtmp->mspec_used) {
                    mtmp->mspec_used += (dmg + rn2(6));
                    if(Confusion)
                         You("are getting even more confused.");
                    else You("are getting confused.");
                    make_confused(HConfusion + dmg, FALSE);
                }
#endif
                /* fall through to next case */
            default:    dmg = 0;
                        break;</syntaxhighlight>

Here is a partial quote of src/mhitu.c lines 1214-1258 from [[NetHack 3.1.0]], the first version to implement the [[Riders]]:

<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
            case AD_CONF:
                hitmsg(mtmp, mattk);
                if(!mtmp->mcan && !rn2(4) && !mtmp->mspec_used) {
                    mtmp->mspec_used = mtmp->mspec_used + (dmg + rn2(6));
                    if(Confusion)
                         You("are getting even more confused.");
                    else You("are getting confused.");
                    make_confused(HConfusion + dmg, FALSE);
                }
                /* fall through to next case */
            case AD_DETH:
                pline("%s reaches out with its deadly touch.", Monnam(mtmp));
                [... the rest of the Rider code ...]
            default:    dmg = 0;
                        break;</syntaxhighlight>

The Rider code was carelessly placed between the AD_CONF section, which handles Yeenoghu's confusion attack, and the default section, where it was supposed to finish. Thus execution improperly proceeded into Death's touch attack.

The bug was written up as bug C331-96<ref>[http://www.nethack.org/v331/bugs.html NetHack 3.3.1 bugs]</ref> and was fixed in [[NetHack 3.4.0]]. Here is src/mhitu.c lines 1474-1486 from [[NetHack 3.4.3]]:

<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
            case AD_CONF:
                hitmsg(mtmp, mattk);
                if(!mtmp->mcan && !rn2(4) && !mtmp->mspec_used) {
                    mtmp->mspec_used = mtmp->mspec_used + (dmg + rn2(6));
                    if(Confusion)
                         You("are getting even more confused.");
                    else You("are getting confused.");
                    make_confused(HConfusion + dmg, FALSE);
                }
                dmg = 0;
                break;
            case AD_DETH:
                pline("%s reaches out with its deadly touch.", Monnam(mtmp));
                [... the rest of the Rider code ...]</syntaxhighlight>

The "dmg = 0;" and "break;" lines duplicate the ones in the default section, and Yeenoghu is restored to his pre-[[NetHack 3.1.0|3.1.0]] behavior.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Yeenoghu}}
Yeenoghu is a character from the  setting of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where he is the demon lord of [[gnoll]]s, which resemble anthropomorphic hyenas. He wields a triple-headed flail.

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], Yeenoghu no longer respects Elbereth.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], Yeenoghu now generates with an [[artifact]] [[triple-headed flail]] called [[Butcher]].

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|
Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth. He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the battle-weary adventurer.

&&%s&& %s Quest {144947 2022-03-17T02:53:43Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Quest branch */ In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''Quest''' is a great journey upon which all seekers of the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]] must embark. It is the only way to obtain the [[Bell of Opening]], which is in turn necessary in order to get the Amulet, so it is [[unwinnable|impossible]] to win NetHack without completing the Quest.

The Quest involves recovering a magic [[artifact]] stolen from your people by a powerful nemesis. Once this task is complete, you are ready to return to your mission to get the Amulet.

==Access==
Somewhere between the [[dungeon level]]s 11 and 16, 6 or 7 levels below the [[Oracle]], you will receive a message from your quest leader, pleading for your help. On this level is a [[magic portal]] that, when found, leads to a new branch of the dungeon. You will find the quest leader in the first level of this branch, and must speak to them before proceeding to subsequent levels. You must be of your original [[alignment]], have at least 20 [[alignment record]], and have at least [[experience level]] 14 to receive permission; see [[#Quest leaders and nemeses|the section on quest leaders]] below for some more detail.

The entrance to the quest proper will be a down stair on the same level as your quest leader. On the bottom level you will encounter your quest nemesis, with the [[Quest artifact|artifact]] and a [[silver bell]]. You cannot go down or level teleport from the Quest home level, even with prior permission, if you are not of your original alignment. Unlike the initial permission requirement, this can be overcome with a [[helm of opposite alignment]].

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You can gain access to the Quest by killing your Quest Leader. Doing so gives +7 to god [[anger]] and -20 to [[Luck]], and causes your Luck to time out to -4. You also forfeit the alignment record bonus from killing your Quest Nemesis.}}

==Quest branch==
The exact composition and inhabitants of the Quest depend on your [[role]], but all Quests share some common features. The Quest always takes place in a separate [[branch]] of the dungeon with at least five levels:

* '''Home level:''' The first level has a layout that is mostly the same in every game played as a given role. It contains your Quest leader (see below) and several [[Quest guardian]]s, [[peaceful|friendly]] monsters present to add flavor. From the home level, you can return to the [[Dungeons of Doom]] through a second magic portal, or you can embark on the Quest through a down staircase on the level. The home level [[non-teleport level|prohibits teleporting]], and the walls and floor are non-diggable.
* '''Upper filler level:''' The second level is a randomly-generated filler level. Depending on your role, it may be a room-and-corridor level, a cavern, or a special type of level.
* '''Locate level:''' The third level also has a layout that is mostly the same for your role, and a message will be displayed each time you enter it until the Quest nemesis is killed. The walls and floor are non-diggable. Other than that, there is nothing special about it.
* '''Lower filler level(s):''' Below the Locate level are one to three more filler levels, which may be the same as or different from the upper filler level.
* '''Goal level:''' The last level is the "Goal" level. Like the Home level, its layout is mostly fixed, and a message will be displayed each time you enter it until the Quest nemesis is killed. The nemesis is generated asleep or meditating, carrying the [[Bell of Opening]], and the [[quest artifact]] is on the floor of the square the nemesis occupies. The walls and floor are non-diggable in all Goal levels; the Goal level in the [[Rogue]] and [[Samurai]] Quests is also no-teleport.

The locate and filler levels are eligible to leave [[bones]]; the home and goal levels are not.

Every time you enter the quest portal level, you'll get a purely cosmetic message about your leader needing your help. If you want to switch it off, #chat with your quest leader while you are carrying the Bell of Opening and the quest artifact.

==Monsters==
While monsters are still randomly-generated, monster generation in the Quest is biased toward monsters that fit its theme (i.e. "quest monsters"). See the following section for a list of quest-specific monsters. Internally, every role has two quest monsters and two quest monster classes; typically, these enemy classes are the classes of the enemy monster, but that is not mandatory (for example, the [[Rogue quest]] breaks this pattern). Monster generation in the Quest uses the following distribution:

* 96/175 (55%) first specific quest monster
* 24/175 (14%) first quest class
* 24/175 (14%) second specific quest monster
* 6/175 (3%) second quest class
* 1/7 (14%) normal random monster

This "biased" part of monster generation is not subject to [[extinction]] where it specifies an individual species, as opposed to a monster class. If an individual monster has been [[genocide]]d (or does not exist at all, such as in the [[Archaeologist quest]]), monsters of the associated class will be generated instead. If the class is also genocided or extinct, the quest monsters will be replaced with ordinary random monsters.<ref>[[Makemon.c#line1090]], [[Makemon.c#line1428]], [[Questpgr.c#qt_montype]], [[You.h#line103]], [[Role.c#line2016]], example: wizards [[Role.c#line561]]</ref> It is possible to make use of this mechanism by genociding a quest monster to increase the number of other monsters of the associated class; see the article on genocide for more details.

==Quest leaders and nemeses==
The '''quest leader''' is the non-player character who verifies that you are ready to undertake the quest and assigns you the mission. If you are not XL 14, but otherwise fulfill the requirements for the quest, you are simply teleported back to the main branch, and can re-enter the quest portal later on. However, if you attack the quest leader,{{refsrc|src/quest.c|320|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} have [[Altar#Sacrificing corpses|converted your alignment]],{{refsrc|src/quest.c|285|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} or fail the alignment test more than seven times,{{refsrc|src/quest.c|290|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} you will be expelled from the quest and the magic portal will be removed. At this point, if you can [[branchport]] back in, you can still pacify them and obtain permission to do the quest; otherwise, the game is [[unwinnable]].

All quest leaders are generated [[meditating]], and those of some roles sit on a [[throne]]. To make them move away before you can get permission, you need to become at least [[fast]], move next to them on a [[speed|free turn]], and either #[[chat]] to them or say no at the prompt for whether to melee them. Once you are teleported out and then re-enter the level, they will move around the area like any other NPC.<!-- Alternatively, you may make a monster throw paralysis (not sleeping) at them, and then decline to melee them when paranoid_hit asks you.-->

The '''quest nemesis''' is the non-player character you must defeat to reclaim your [[quest artifact]] and the [[Bell of Opening]]. It's possible to [[ascend]] without killing your quest nemesis, but this is exceedingly rare. Every quest nemesis resists [[stoning]]; nemeses represented by {{white|@}} do not respect [[Elbereth]], but those belonging to other classes do.
