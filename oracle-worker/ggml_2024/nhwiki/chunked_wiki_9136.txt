The traditional basilisk/Cockatrice is simply deadly. The stoning attack property, comes from [[D&D]].

Like the Cockatrice, it basically resembles a rooster with a reptilian tail and sometimes bat wings. This is why the basilisk is represented by the reptile symbol ":".

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are
just right, a seven-year-old rooster will lay an egg.  Then,
along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation
to wither.

There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows
why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to
sicken and die.

The '''Asphynx''' is one of two monsters added in [[SLASH'EM]] that share the [[cockatrice]]'s petrification attacks. An asphynx is capable of killing you in the same way a cockatrice is; touching a living or deceased asphynx with an exposed part of your body is instadeath, and the asphynx causes delayed petrification in the same manner as a cockatrice. See the article on the cockatrice for specifics of petrification.

An asphynx is much more dangerous than a cockatrice, as it has more hit dice, lower AC, and is faster than a player without speed. The asphynx is also capable of hiding under items like other snakes, potentially catching the player offguard. 

== Strategy ==

The asphynx is a more dangerous version of a cockatrice and thus should be handled with the same care. The increased difficulty means that they will appear later in the game, preferably late enough for the character to have acquired intrinsic or extrinsic speed. The corpse of an asphynx can be used as a weapon to stone non-petrification resistant monsters (be sure to wear gloves), but the corpse is slightly heavier and the asphynx is both rarer and more difficult to kill, so a cockatrice corpse remains preferable.

SLASH'EM's additional petrifying monsters means that it is no longer possible to avoid potential [[YASD]]s by blessed genociding c, as neither the asphynx nor the [[basilisk]] are c.

Polymorphing into an asphynx is a better choice for emergency situations than a cockatrice, unless the player is a low level [[doppelganger (starting race)|doppelganger]]. Like a cockatrice an asphynx can lay eggs that will cause stoning, so female players have the option of polymorphing into an asphynx to create future weapons. In most situations, polymorphing into a basilisk is preferable: they have the same HD, and while an asphynx is faster, a basilisk can carry far more (which in an emergency may make them faster, since an asphynx will need to spend turns dropping items), and is capable of picking up items, something asphynxes cannot do.  The only reason to polymorph into an asphynx is if you intend to lay eggs to turn them into pets: an asphynx's higher speed makes it a more useful pet than a basilisk.  A pet asphynx will attempt to hide under items, which can be annoying if you do not have a [[magic whistle]].

A '''blood imp''' is a [[minor demon]] added in [[SLASH'EM]].
they
==Description==

Blood imps are the most powerful of the new [[imp]]-like monsters added in SLASH'EM, the others being [[dretch]]es, [[rutterkin]] and [[nupperibo]]s.  They have two decently powerful melee attacks, the first of which is [[poison]]-branded, and share the imp's speed and [[regeneration]].

==Strategy==

Poison is unlikely to be a threat by the time blood imps appear, and regeneration is much less powerful once the player is dealing more damage.  As a result, blood imps are generally not a huge threat by the time one encounters them, although an out-of-depth blood imp (e.g. from a [[polytrap]]) can spell doom to an unwary player.

A '''rutterkin''' is a [[minor demon]] added in [[SLASH'EM]].  It is similar to an [[imp]], sharing its speed and [[regeneration|regenerative]] abilities, but has more [[HD]] and a [[poison]]-branded attack.

==Generation==

Rutterkin are generated randomly.  Like many other minor demons, they are not confined to [[Gehennom]], though they can also be found there.

==Strategy==

By the time one encounters them, rutterkin are generally not a threat: the character will likely have [[poison resistance]] or at least good [[magic cancellation]], and monster regeneration is less of a danger outside the early game, where characters (and monsters) do more damage.

The '''byakhee''' is a type of [[monster]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]], and it also appears in [[dNetHack]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. Byakhees are much stronger members of the {{monclass|B}} [[monster class]], and move erratically like the other monsters in that class.

A byakhee has [[sleep resistance]], [[poison resistance]] and [[cold resistance]]; they possess [[regeneration]], [[flight]], are [[breathless]], and can [[follow]] you to other levels. Byakhees have four melee attacks, including a sting that can [[stun]] you and is unaffected by [[magic cancellation]].

==Generation==
Byakhees are always generated hostile, and may appear in small [[group]]s.

==Strategy==
From the mid-game on, byakhees represent a troubling threat due to their 20 [[speed]] and stun-inducing melee sting, making it possible for them to wear you down while you either whiff attacks from being stunned or spend turns trying to cure it. Additionally, their regeneration makes killing them difficult if you cannot deal enough damage consistently, even when using [[Elbereth]]. While not on par with the [[Golem (SLASH'EM)|greater golems]], they can remain nuisances well into the late game.

Strong and consistent forms of offense, such as well-enchanted weapons, are best for dealing with byakhees; funneling them down halls may be ideal due to their scattered movement and tendency to appear in groups. Their [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR score]] of 25 also leaves them fairly vulnerable to magic and other effects - in particular, [[spellbook of charm monster|charming]] or [[scroll of taming|taming]] them may work in your favor, as byakhees are decent options for pets due to the speed, regeneration and stun attacks that make them such a danger.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Byakhee}}
The byakhees (or byakhee birds) originate from the [[H.P. Lovecraft]] short story "The Festival", and were later featured in August Derleth's tale "The House on Curwen Street". They are servants of the Great Old One Hastur, and their description in "The Festival" paints them as four-limbed eldritch monsters with bat-like wings, possessing visual traits of various animals such as vampire bats, crows and buzzards, as well as somewhat resembling human corpses. The text specifically describes them as "not altogether crows, nor" any of the other descriptors used, and their otherworldly, eldritch nature is emphasized by the speaker's difficulty in fully recalling their appearance.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|	A creature of the stars, this bat like being can be summoned
across the vast interstellar gulfs to serve magicians and
dark powers.  It is said that they will seize those who 
summon them and cannot best them and carry them off to whatever
terrible fate awaits them on other worlds.

In UnNetHack, you may very rarely generate a potion of blood by [[apply]]ing a [[horn of plenty]].

The potion of blood is roughly equivalent to a [[potion of fruit juice]] for vampires - a player vampire that quaffs one will gain 30 nutrition for a blessed ptoion or 20 for an uncursed potion, with a diluted potion giving half of the appropriate value. The contents of a cursed potion of blood have congealed, and will give 0 nutrition. Non-vampire players that drink any potion of blood will instead become [[nauseous]] and vomit for 10d8 (more) turns.

All players vampires that would normally start with food items will receive potions of vampire blood instead - they can also create a potion using the [[draw blood]] technique if they have a [[medical kit]] with usable phials and a level to spare. Undead [[vampire]]s, [[vampire lord]]s and [[vampire mage]]s have a 50% chance of generating with a potion of blood, with a ''(level)''/30 chance that the potion will instead be vampire blood.<ref name="bloodgen"/> Potions of vampire blood can be made via alchemy by dipping vampire blood into potions of fruit juice.

In UnNetHack, you may very rarely generate a potion of vampire blood by applying a horn of plenty, and you can get the effect of a potion of vampire blood if you quaff from [[Sink#UnNetHack|sinks in UnNetHack]].

===Effects===
Player vampires that drink a noncursed potion of vampire blood gain 800 nutrition points (400 if diluted). Additionally, a blessed potion increases your HP and max HP by the same amount as from a level gain. Non-player [[Vampire (monster class)|vampires]] (including [[fire vampire]]s and [[star vampire]]s) will drink the potion to heal themselves, restoring 2-10 HP if it is non-cursed and none if it is cursed.<ref>[[source:SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/muse.c#963]]</ref>

Non-vampire players that quaff the potion will instead be subjected to mostly-adverse effects that vary depending on the variant:

* In SLASH'EM, a potion of any beatitude will polymorph you into a vampire, abusing your [[constitution]]; neutral characters will suffer a &minus;3 alignment penalty, while lawful characters and Monks will suffer a &minus;15 alignment penalty and anger their god.
* In UnNetHack, the potion's beatitude determines the vampiric creature you polymorph into: a blessed potion will turn you into a vampire lord, an uncursed one polymorphs the player into a vampire as in SLASH'EM, and a cursed potion changes the player into a [[vampire bat]].

Polymorphing induced by a potion of vampire blood is "semi-permanent" &mdash;you will revert back to your normal form if your HP is drained to zero, but there is no timeout for the form otherwise.

As with regular blood, dipping a unicorn horn into a potion of vampire blood will turn it into water. A thrown potion of vampire blood that lands on a non-chaotic altar will convert the altar to chaotic, abuses your [[wisdom]] regardless of alignment and angers any attendant [[aligned priest|priest]].<ref name="altarblood">

===Strategy===
Player vampires that encounter enemy vampires should kill them quickly to avoid losing any possible potions of vampire blood. Other players that are not chaotic and unwilling to risk their alignment or their god's wrath are better off converting the potions to water.

The standard shoggoth is an unpleasant monster to encounter. It is faster than an unhasted player and can deal a substantial amount of damage, all while degrading every iron and copper item in your inventory. This includes non-weapon items as well, although the effect on those is mostly cosmetic. Fortunately, like its larger cousin, it prefers to hide rather than fight, and so can be left alone.

They have a speed of 20 (making them as fast as a player in speed boots), an [[engulfing attack]] which, in addition to doing a ton of [[acid]] damage, [[corrosion|corrodes]] most of the corrodable items in your inventory (which means you will be walking around with corroded wands and keys for a while), in addition to two very powerful claw attacks. They also have a very high base level, meaning lots and lots of HP.

They can also teleport when they flee. However, they will not teleport to encounter you, preferring to remain hidden. If you choose to reverse genocide them, you should do so on a [[non-teleport level]]; otherwise they will soon scatter themselves.

{{clear}}

===Strategy===
Luckily for those who encounter them, shoggoths are not whirly like [[air elemental]]s, and thus a [[wand of digging]] will work to expel you and set them to one hit point.  However, an engulfed player still has to deal with their 8d10 engulfing damage at least once, not to mention their bite and corrosion attacks. If you have low HP, it is best to avoid being engulfed altogether. [[Acid resistance]], as granted by a [[lab coat]], [[alchemy smock]], or [[yellow dragon scale mail]], will protect you against the damage from the engulfing attack but not from the biting attacks.

Also, shoggoths, unlike other super-monsters in SLASH'EM, are not immune to [[Wand of death|death rays]]. Given the greater number of charges on wands in SLASH'EM, an awake and non-hiding giant shoggoth (see below) is well worth a charge or two from a wand of death, or a casting of {{Spell of|finger of death}}. A wand of death is also a good option if you find yourself engulfed and lack a wand of digging, or if you are low on hit points, as the shoggoth may re-engulf you before you can respond if you zap it from inside with a wand of digging.

The shoggoths and their giant variant do not actually pose a threat to a careful player when they normally appear, because, like trappers and rock piercers, they hide until you enter their square. Thus if you have [[warning]] or extrinsic [[telepathy]], you will never be taken by surprise by a "natural" shoggoth. And you will, by the time shoggoths can appear. This is probably a very good thing because [[Demogorgon]]'s lair is full of shoggoths, which would almost be as bad as Demogorgon himself if they weren't avoidable in this fashion.

Unfortunately for some unlucky players, shoggoths are considered a valid polymorphable form. This means that a [[chameleon]] can turn into one on dungeon level 9, or any monster could theoretically step on a [[polymorph trap]] and turn into one. Since shoggoths are faster than the player, this is very likely to become [[YAAD]].

===Uses===
The fact that shoggoths are considered a valid polymorphable form is very useful for any player with [[polymorph control]] and a source of [[polymorph]].  As a giant shoggoth, you will wipe out [[shopkeeper]]s in the early game, but more importantly, the form can be used to rob the [[Black market (SLASH'EM)|black market]] later on.  They have enough hitpoints to weather One-eyed Sam's attacks, and since they are not @'s (and have no heads anyway), they need not worry about the beheading and canceling abilities of Thiefbane.  Being immune to stoning, they do not need to worry about the cockatrices that guard the black market, and the other monsters there are quite trivial.  Giant shoggoths do not make particularly good traveling polymorph forms though, as they are blind, cannot use weapons and armor, and have no hands. [[Monk]]s are better able to make use of the giant shoggoth form, as the [[Eyes of the Overworld]] will allow sight, and doors can be dealt with by casting {{spell of|force bolt}}. However, you still will not be able to access containers in this form, so it is still better suited to situations where you need a strong melee form (such as the [[Temple of Moloch]] or the [[Astral Plane]]) rather than a general-purpose travel form.

Another use of giant shoggoths (but not the normal variety) is that their corpses are capable of conveying [[teleport control]], but also [[teleportitis]]. This is not terribly useful in and of itself, as typically one will encounter them only shortly before getting the [[Amulet of Yendor]], which in SLASH'EM prevents all forms of teleportation. However, a careful player may find it useful to [[reverse genocide]] them, provided they use some permanently engraved and well-placed [[Elbereth]] squares. They have a higher chance than [[tengu]] to grant the intrinsic, and they always leave corpses. In addition, their corpses are also capable of granting poison resistance, shock resistance, and cold resistance. They do have a high nutritional value, so a player would be well-advised to use a [[tinning kit]] or [[amulet of magical breathing]] when doing this.

Shoggoths would appear to make good pets, as they have extremely damaging attacks and move quickly. Shoggoths are also relatively easy to tame, as the regular variant only has [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]] 25 and will grow up into a giant shoggoth.  Because they tend to hide, it is very safe and easy to walk up to one and repeatedly cast {{spell of|charm monster}} until it becomes tame. While shoggoths are certainly capable of doing large amounts of damage, the fact that they hide, eat both metallic items and regular food, and always have a chance of turning traitor mean that they are difficult to control, especially without a [[magic whistle]]. Despite having extremely powerful attacks, even giant shoggoths only [[Need +x weapon to hit|hit monsters as a +0 weapon]], meaning that they are completely incapable of damaging many of the more powerful monsters that you will encounter in SLASH'EM. Their only advantage over a Solar is that they are much easier to tame and it is easier to raise their tameness, as they will eat almost anything.

In [[dNetHack]], the shoggoth has a unique suction attack with a variety of effects. Each effect is independent, and more than one can occur with the same hit. The effects occur in the following order:

* If your HP is at less than 10%, you have a head, and you aren't wearing a helmet, there is a 5% chance of your head being sucked off, killing you. No further effects will be applied this turn.
* There is a 10% chance that both your legs are badly injured.
* There is a 15% chance that your weapon is sucked out of your grasp. High strength can help prevent this.
* There is a 10% chance that your boots are sucked off, unless they are buckled boots.
* There is a 15% chance that your gloves are sucked off, unless you are wielding a weapon. High strength can block this completely.
* There is a 7% chance that your shield is sucked off. High strength can help prevent this.
* There is a 25% chance that your helmet is sucked off.

==Mythology==

Shoggoths come from the works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]]. The encyclopedia entries are excerpts from Lovecraft's works.

They appear as massive amoeboid creatures made out of iridescent black slime, with multiple eyes floating on the surface. An average Shoggoth measured 4.5 meters (15 feet) across when a sphere, but they can get much larger. They show signs of intelligence.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

"... in the place of utter blasphemy, the unholy pit where
the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate -
I saw a shoggoth - it changed shape ..."

It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster than any subway
train -- a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly
self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and
un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-
filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic
penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and
its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. Still came
that eldritch, mocking cry -- "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" and at

They have relatively damaging attacks and are generated with weapons. Gnolls are always generated hidden, so if you are able to detect them through [[telepathy]] it may be wise to avoid them completely. Higher level gnolls can be generated with [[dragon scale mail]], but all gnolls are [[Physical size|too large]] to wear body armor. None are considered a valid polymorphable form.

As [[Yeenoghu]] is considered the demon prince of gnolls, many are found in [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Yeenoghu's lair|his lair]] in [[Gehennom]].

==Other variants==

===dNetHack===
{{main|Gnoll (dNethack)}}
In [[dNethack]], gnolls are almost entirely different from their counterparts SLASH'EM. They are not represented by {{white|G}}, and have different stats. Gnolls can still be found in Yeenoghu's lair in dNethack.

===GnollHack===
In [[GnollHack]], gnolls are a playable race. They also exist as monsters which are very different than SLASH'EM's gnolls.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack]], gnolls are represented by {{white|9}}. A new gnoll was added, the [[marrashi]]. Gnoll shamans start with a [[parazonium]] instead of an athame. Otherwise they are similar to SLASH'EM's gnolls.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Gnoll}}
The gnoll is a ''Dungeons & Dragons'' creature resembling a humanoid hyena.  Many serve and worship the demon god [[Yeenoghu]].

Gnolls were an early creation of D&D, and are described in the first manual, released in 1974.  Irish fantasy author [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Plunkett,_18th_Baron_of_Dunsany Lord Dunsany] (1878-1957) was given credit for inventing the word "gnoll", or, as he spelled it, "gnole", in a short story published in 1912 called [http://www.sff.net/people/doylemacdonald/d_nuth.htm "How Nuth Would Have Practised His Art upon the Gnoles"].  

D&D gnolls are somewhat different from Dunsany's "gnoles".  Dunsany does not give a description of what his "gnoles" look like, but portrays them as secretive but dangerous creatures that guard a hoard of emeralds in a house in a forbidding forest. The gnolls of D&D, by comparison, are described as aggressive desert-dwelling nomads that actively raid and plunder other settlements.

Early D&D manuals state that gnolls are a cross between [[gnome]]s and [[troll]]s, which implies that the name "gnoll" is a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/portmanteau#Etymology_2 portmanteau] of the two words.  However, the authors acknowledge that Dunsany never stated what the inspiration was for his word "gnole", and later manuals do not describe gnolls' pedigree.  SLASH'EM includes them in the [[Gnome (monster class)|gnome]] [[monster class]], but does not consider them to be [[Monster attribute|gnomish]] for purposes of [[cannibalism]], so [[gnome (starting race)|gnome]] players can eat their corpses without an alignment penalty. (Their corpses are [[poisonous]], however, so one should avoid eating them without [[poison resistance]].)

A '''chasme''' is a demon added in [[SLASH'EM]]. They are unusually fast for a demon and possess a sleep gaze attack that is very dangerous if you do not have sleep resistance. Fortunately they are only randomly generated in [[Gehennom]], by which time you will almost certainly have acquired sleep resistance.

== Strategy ==
A hostile chasme is extremely dangerous if encountered before you have sleep resistance. Blinding yourself with a [[towel]] or [[blindfold]] will negate the sleep attack, but poses its own problems if you are not telepathic. Being invisible also gives a chance for the gaze to not connect (''The chasme gazes around, but misses you!''). Reflection will also protect you, and can put the attacker to sleep if you are not invisible.

Chasmes make superb polymorph forms as they fly, move very quickly, can put monsters to sleep, are inediate, and are capable of [[demon|demon gating]] (but incapable of wearing body armor!). The gaze attack can be used manually with the #monster [[extended command]], but is also done automatically when attacking in melee. Using the gaze attack in melee on a reflecting monster will cause it to be reflected back to you - chasmes are not sleep resistant, and therefore it is possible to put yourself to sleep if you have polymorphed into a chasme before acquiring sleep resistance. Also, like all gaze attacks, it fails if [[you]] are invisible yourself. Attacking bare-handed also gives a chance of summoning a tame chasme. A tame chasme is a good pet due to their speed and ability to put monsters to sleep, but chasmes are [[Pet_(SLASH'EM)#Treachery|traitorous]] and have a chance of spontaneously rebelling. It is not advisible to demon gate a chasme until after acquiring sleep resistance.

However, if you have teleport control, during an intense battle you can save it for last, and use it for the free teleportation. Eating the corpse of a blinking eye has a very large chance of conveying teleportitis.

The '''nickelpede''' is a monster that appears in [[SLASH'EM]]. It is the "big brother" of the [[centipede]]. They are not poisonous to eat but have a high chance of conferring poison resistance.

==Origin==
The nickelpede is a reference to the [[wikipedia:Xanth|Xanth]] novels, and is a [[pun]] based on a play off the words "cent" and "centipede". In Xanth, they are described as "five times as bad as centipedes, gouging out nickel-sized disks of flesh".<ref>Currant Events, page 53</ref>.

&&%s&& %s Kobold (SLASH'EM) {148808 2022-10-13T06:53:13Z {375 Ion frigate} Expanded, these guys are a pretty boring lot [[SLASH'EM]] introduces three new types of [[kobold]]s and a unique kobold, [[Kroo the Kobold King]]; all varieties of kobold can be found on their own [[Special level (SLASH'EM)|special level]], known simplay as the [[kobold level]].  They are also generated randomly.

The new non-unique kobolds in SLASH'EM are fairly indistinct: only their increased hit dice and damage dice distinguish them from [[vanilla]] kobolds.  All can occasionally present a danger to characters with poor [[AC]], but are otherwise not overly threatening.

== Swamp kobold ==
Swamp kobolds have one more HD than [[kobold lord]]s, but do a similar amount of damage in melee.  Despite what their name might suggest, they cannot [[swim]].
