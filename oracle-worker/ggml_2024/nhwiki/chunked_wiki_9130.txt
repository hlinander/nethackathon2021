==== The end? ====
[[Death (character)|Die]] (or [[ascension|win]])! If you've fallen in battle (even if your life gets saved somehow) you drink twice to mourn your loss. Feel free to drink more than twice, dying can be rough.

For each [[conduct]] (official or unofficial) retained unbroken upon death or ascension, give out 1 drink.

If an ascension occurs, the ascending player first pays triple their ante fee, plus any other drinks deemed reasonable/necessary by the other players (non-negotiable). Then, for the remainder of the evening, the ascended player may want only deliver drinks to anyone, as they are a [[demigod]] and that's how it goes.

To play again, simply pay your previous ante cost plus your new ante cost. To clarify, if you paid 5 drinks on your first character and are paying 1 drink on your next character (more common than you might think) you take 6 drinks, but your ante for this round is 1. Next run, you pay 1 for your last ante and whatever your current ante cost might be. That way we don't have too many Mayors McCheese strolling around and upsetting the citizenry.

==== Play again? [ynq] ====
To play again, simply pay your previous ante cost plus your new ante cost. To clarify, if you paid 6 on your first character and are getting ready to pay 1 for your second character (more common than you might think) you take 7 drinks, but your ante for the second round is 1. Round 3, you pay 1 for your last ante and whatever your current ante cost might be.

==== Mayor McCheese ====
The term "Mayor McCheese" designates someone who plays the NetHack Quaffing Game (or even [[NetHack]] itself) with the intent to bend the odds in their own favor to some degree, large or small. Perhaps because the NetHack Quaffing Game is nothing short of [[RNG]] worship, even selecting your own race/role/gender/alignment is action considered grounds for instant mayoral election. "Mayors McCheese" (as they are called plurally) pay quite a bit more drinks to play than your average nameless hacker as a consequence of the burdens of cheesy office. See the ante section for more information on the costs (in drinks quaffed, silly!) to play the NetHack Quaffing Game.

This will initiate a [[melee]] attack using the weapon you are [[wield|wielding]], or your hands if you aren't holding a weapon. But be warned: some monsters automatically retaliate to melee attacks with a [[passive attack]] that can hurt you greatly.  Doing this with your pet is usually safe - you will attempt to displace it rather than attack it (unless your weapon is [[bloodthirsty]]). If you ''want'' to attack your pet for some reason, you can use the {{kbd|Shift}}-{{kbd|F}} command to force your next input to be interpreted as a melee attack. 

You can use a [[ranged attack]] to attack from a distance. Use {{kbd|f}} to fire a weapon or item that you have [[quiver|quivered]], or use {{kbd|t}} to manually choose something to throw. You can throw anything, but some [[projectile|projectiles]], like [[darts]] or [[shuriken]], are designed to be thrown. Other projectiles are meant to be used with a [[launcher]]. For example, wield a [[bow]] to fire [[arrows]].

[[Magic]] is another option for attacking a monster. If you have an [[attack spell]] memorized, and sufficient [[power]], you may cast it using the {{kbd|Shift}}-{{kbd|Z}} command. If you have an [[attack wand]], you can zap it with {{kbd|z}}. [[Frost horn|Frost horns]] or [[fire horn|fire horns]] are also sources of magical attacks. Use {{kbd|a}} to apply them.

To know how likely you are to hit in combat (and conversely how likely monsters are to hit you), see the [[Armor Class]] page. The [[Weapons]] page will tell you all about the different kinds of weapons in terms of damage and other properties, but note that for ranges of weapons you may need to look elsewhere (for instance, the range of your bow is actually defined by the type of [[Arrow]], it would seem, and most objects of reasonable throwing weight seem to have similar ranges as arrows).

It is important to note that you don't have to attack every monster you encounter. Some are best left alone or actively avoided. As the proverb states, discretion is the better part of valor.

A '''dretch''', {{yellow|i}}, is a monster that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is a [[minor demon]] that is almost identical to an [[imp]], including the tendency to taunt you with [[demonic malediction]]s. The only differences are its base level, which is one lower than the imp, and the chance of [[treachery]] - it is likely the first monster you will encounter than can potentially turn hostile even while tame, unless you have more HP.

==Strategy==
Dretches are somewhat tricky to hit for early characters, but do not pose any more significant threat than their imp brethren.

&&%s&& %s The Arkenstone {148480 2022-10-05T00:43:34Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} de-SLEX '''The Arkenstone''' is a [[defunct features|defunct]] [[Quest artifact]] [[diamond]] belonging to the Dwarf role, which existed in versions of [[SLASH'EM]] before [[NetHack 3.3.0]] made race and role separate choices.  When carried, it gave [[magic resistance]] and acted as a [[luckstone]]. When invoked, it granted [[object detection]], as per the potion. 

==Origin==
The Arkenstone comes from the [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien universe]].  It was one of the greatest treasures of the dwarves of Erebor (the Lonely Mountain), who called it the "Heart of the Mountain".  Its function as a light source, or as a means of detecting treasure, is inspired by Bilbo's discovering it in the hoard of Smaug by its own luminosity.  Its association with conflict was probably suggested by its role in the dispute that preceded the Battle of the Five Armies.

==Variants==

===Arkenstone patch===

{{patch
 |name=Arkenstone v. 1
 |author=Aardvark Joe
 |download=http://bernoulli.atspace.com/nethack/patches/arkenstone-v1.patch
 |bilious=291
}}

The Arkenstone patch for vanilla NetHack makes it a randomly generated lawful artifact that can occasionally (with a 1 in 75 chance) be found in the inventory of a [[dwarf king]].  This version of the Arkenstone is coveted by all monsters, so carrying it in open inventory causes [[conflict]] and [[aggravate monster]].  Even demons want it: if a [[demon prince]] sees that you have the Arkenstone in your open inventory, it will demand the gem as a [[bribe]], instead of [[gold]].

===dNetHack===

The Arkenstone is also present in [[dNetHack]] as the [[crowning]] gift for [[dwarf]] [[knight]]s, a chaotic diamond.  Here it does not aggravate monsters, and its conflict effect is toggled by invoking it (as with the [[Sceptre of Might]]).  In addition, it functions as a [[light source]] when carried in open inventory.

==Encyclopedia entry==
===SLASH'EM===
{{encyclopedia|Arkenstone, Heart of the Mountain, property of the King
under the Mountain, is the most valued jewel that the
dwarves possess. It shines white light that can guide
your steps in the darkness, and carrying it is said
to increase your carrying capacity. When invoked it
will reveal the gold around you.}}

===Patch===
{{encyclopedia|It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo
guessed from Thorin's description; but indeed there could not
be two such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all
the world.  Ever as he climbed, the same white gleam had shone
before him and drawn his feet towards it.  Slowly it grew to a
little globe of pallid light.  Now as he came near, it was
tinged with a flickering sparkle of many colours at the
surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of
his torch.  At last he looked down upon it, and he caught his
breath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner
light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug
it from the heart of the mountain long ago, it  took all light
that fell upon it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of
white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.
[ The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]}}

'''Gugs''' are a new monster in [[SLASH'EM]]. They appear in large groups, are fast and hard-hitting, and have a paralyzing bite.

==Strategy==  

Although by the time you encounter them, your [[magic cancellation]] should neutralize the paralysis, gugs are still a large threat in the midgame, mainly because they appear in large groups and are quite fast.  Note that they can be detected through [[telepathy]]; in general, one should exercise caution when seeing a {{monsym/gug}} with a mind in SLASH'EM; it is either a hard-hitting gug, or a spellcasting [[ghoul mage]] or [[ghoul queen]].

The '''fire vampire''' is a powerful type of [[Vampire (monster class)|vampire]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. Unlike other members of the [[monster class]], it is not [[undead]] and is instead an extraterrestrial being that is [[humanoid]] and [[infravisible]], though it still shares the vampire's [[regeneration]] abilities and resistances along with their weakness to [[silver]]. 

Fire vampires are [[unbreathing]] and capable of [[flight]], and can [[follow]] you to other levels; they also possess [[fire resistance]] and [[cold resistance]]. They move at twice the speed of an unhasted, unburdened player character, and have five total attacks: two fire-element claw attacks, a [[life drain]]ing bite, an [[energy drain]]ing touch, and a ray-type fire [[monster spell]] similar to the [[magic missile]] attack of [[Angel]]s and [[Yeenoghu]] and the cold attack of [[Asmodeus]] - this spell is a [[deferred feature]] in vanilla ''[[NetHack]]'', and is similar to the [[fireball]] spell when used at a distance.

==Generation==
A fire vampire always generates as hostile, and [[Corpseless|will never leave a corpse]] when killed.

In addition to random generation, fire vampires may be generated in any level or branch where random {{white|V}} are placed at level creation.

==Strategy==
The fire vampire can be very dangerous to the unprepared, as its 24 speed and melee-range fire spell can quickly burn through much of your HP; the fire spell  bypasses [[reflection]] at a distance and can also [[burn]] applicable items in your inventory. Additionally, they have a natural [[AC]] of 0 and are capable of wearing all armor. The [[Chaotic Quest]] in particular is a disaster waiting to happen for those without fire resistance, as fire vampires can generate among the random {{white|V}} placed on level creation.

Fire resistance will blunt most of the damage from fire vampire attacks, though it will not protect your inventory; once you obtain fire resistance, you may want to turn off the '[[sparkle]]' [[option]] in order to shorten the time used on animations and lessen distractions during combat with them. As they are not undead, fire vampires lack [[drain resistance]] and can be weakened with the [[wand of draining]] among other similar items and effects, though they still have a solid [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR score]] of 50.

===As a polyform===
A fire vampire is one of the strongest polyforms for any character with a means of [[polymorph]] and a source of [[polymorph control]] due to their high speed, regeneration, flight, 0 AC, and ability to wear all armor. For a [[Doppelganger (starting race)|doppleganger]] in particular that gains polymorph control through experience levels or an external source, fire vampires represent a power boost that can buoy even weaker characters against high-level threats.

Be careful not to rely too much on it in either case, however - in addition to [[Doppelganger (starting race)#Strategy|the perils of excessive shapechanging]] for dopplegangers in particular, fire vampires cannot utilize silver weapons and items, and monsters such as [[footrice]]s can result in an undignified [[instadeath]] by [[stoning]] if you are careless. Fire vampires can also only feed by draining the blood of other monsters like the rest of their vampire kin, and as such may make its use difficult in certain stages of the game. Finally, their fire attacks will destroy scrolls and potions in monsters' inventories, which is a variable concern depending on how much loot you seek out at a given point.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Cthugha}}
Fire vampires are extraterrestrial monsters that originate from Donald Wandrei's short story "The Fire Vampires", which is considered part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. There are two distinct kinds of fire vampire: the flame Creatures of Cthugha that appear as many points of fiery light, and the fire Vampires of Fthaggua that appear as crimson bursts of lightning. Their tile and description in SLASH'EM could easily depict either; somewhat strangely, they are still considered humanoid.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
A swirling cloud of bright, burning motes, the fire vampire
descends upon its victim and easily burns them to death once 
they are in its deadly embrace.

When a room and corridor level is generated, secret passages are often created on some corridor squares.  You can sometimes guess the existance of a secret passage from surrounding corridor squares, especially if they are at a corner, but corridors can also have natural dead ends.

Until exposed, a secret passage doesn't only look like solid wall, but also acts like one: monsters (including pets) won't step on a secret passage square, the square blocks thrown objects, and you can't see through them.  

== Exposing a secret passage ==

There are multiple ways to expose a secret passage, turning it to an ordinary corridor square.

* The [[search]] command or the [[automatic searching]] property has a chance of finding them: see [[searching]] for what influences the probability.
* Apply a [[stethoscope]] at them.
* Read a blessed [[scroll of magic mapping]].
* Cast the [[spellbook of detect unseen|spell of detect unseen]] or zap the [[wand of secret door detection]] when you're near the corridor.
* Start to [[dig]] the secret door square.
* Kicking can expose them sometimes.

Secret passages are more difficult to expose than [[secret door]]s, as effects that would usually open or break down a door (multiple wands or spells) do not work on them.

Interesting link about the new game Borderlands: only tangentially news about Nethack regarding its influences on the president of Gearbox Randy Pitchford.

"Whenever I’m asked what is the game I’ve spent more time playing than any other, the answer is Nethack. And whenever I’m asked what is my favourite game, it’s Doom II.

And Borderlands is really just Doom II plus Nethack. Or you can say it’s Halo plus Diablo… but Halo’s just an iteration of Doom II and Diablo is a graphical interface for Nethack.”

&&%s&& %s Lycanthrope (starting race) {145768 2022-04-30T07:52:25Z {4000978 Aximili}  '''Lycanthropes''' are a race available in certain [[variant]]s, including [[SLASH'EM]]. In SLASH'EM, lycanthropes are always [[chaotic]] and can play as a [[Barbarian]], [[Ranger]], [[Rogue]], or [[Undead Slayer]]. Lycanthrope characters offer a very different play experience from the other races. According to the guidebook:

{{guidebook|Lycanthropes are wild beasts who draw their strength from the phases of the moon, and can transform into wolves when they channel their magical energies. Even unarmed, a Lycanthrope is a savage fighter, as many scarred by their deadly claws can attest.}}  

== Starting properties ==
Lycanthropes start with the following attributes:
*[[Regeneration]]
*[[Lycanthropy]] (as a [[werewolf]])
*[[Drain resistance]]
*Polyself
*The [[eviscerate]] [[technique]]

Any silver weapons that may be generated in a lycanthrope's starting inventory are reverted to their non-silver counterpart.

Lycanthropic characters generally have excellent physical stats, but poor mental ones. The following table contains the maximum initial [[attribute]]s for a lycanthropic character.

== Strategy ==

=== Regeneration and nutrition ===
Starting as a lycanthropic character can be exceptionally difficult, especially early in the game, as all lycanthropic characters begin with the [[regeneration]] intrinsic and the extra hunger it induces. On the one hand, this can make many early fights significantly easier. On the other hand, the small [[nutrition]]al value of the [[corpse]]s typical for the first few levels puts lycanthropic characters at risk of starving. Often it is better to make for the [[Gnomish Mines]] or [[Sokoban]] than to stay near the first few levels of the dungeon, at least until you have a good stockpile of rations.

=== Lycanthropy ===
Lycanthropic characters, as the name suggests, have intrinsic and incurable [[lycanthropy]]. Specifically, they are werewolves. This comes with all the benefits and downsides this intrinsic has, with a few exceptions:

*A lycanthropic character will only change form about once per 100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;[[experience level|XL]] turns. At higher levels, this will be indicated by "You feel less in control of yourself".
*A natural lycanthrope, like a [[doppelganger]], will remove non-cursed body armor when they change form. Cursed armor will still be destroyed as normal.
*A lycanthropic character in wolf form will have hit dice equal to their current level. This is more than acquired lycantropy gives.
*If killed in wolf form, you transform back into your humanoid form with half of your base HP missing. This includes deaths by food poisoning.
*You can [[exercise]] and increase your stats.
*Your AC is significantly lower while transformed. As your HP increases, your AC will drop even further.
*You are poison resistant while transformed.

There are particular downsides of being transformed:

*You cannot wear armor (but you can wear accessories).
*You cannot engrave.
*You cannot open doors. (You can still kick them down, however.)
*You cannot apply items.
*You cannot force locks.
*Your carrying capacity is significantly reduced.

It is possible to throw items, such as daggers or potions, while transformed.

=== Polyself ===
Lycanthropes start with the ability to change between humanoid and wolf form; using this ability requires 20 [[power]]. All polymorph effects simply switch them between humanoid and wolf forms.

=== #monster ===
When in wolf form, you can spend 10 power to [[summon]] a few [[tame]] [[wolf|wolves]] or [[winter wolf cub]]s to aid you in battle. Winter wolf cubs are quite advantageous, as they eventually [[growing up|grow]] into fairly potent winter wolves.

=== Early game ===
Early on, it pays significantly to become familiar with the ins and outs of the limitations of your wolf form. Often it is best to simply dump your primary weapon and armor right when you begin, to save both space and time when the first transformation occurs. Body armor is weighty and nearly worthless until you have the ability to freely control when you transform. Keep any daggers you start with, and save up as many others as you can safely carry in a single stack. Every one of the lycanthropic classes bar [[Barbarian]] can reach expert [[skill]] in [[dagger]]s, and they can be [[firing|fired]] even in wolf form. Do this to soften up enemies at range before they come close enough to hit you in melee. If you get in trouble, the techniques [[eviscerate]] and [[berserk]] can be used in a pinch to prevent an untimely death against a stronger foe (for example, a single [[soldier ant]] or [[yeti]] when you are level 7). Feel free to #monster a few times to get a small pack of wolves. 

Your first major challenge as a lycanthrope is to find enough non-perishable food. Otherwise, you would starve due to your innate regeneration. This is normally best done by either rushing for the first half of the [[Gnomish Mines]] or [[Sokoban]], depending on your play style. The Gnomish Mines are much easier to reach as a low-level character, and the resulting gnome and dwarf corpses there can keep you fed while you collect rations and other food. Sokoban is harder to reach, but it's guaranteed to have at least five ration items and either an [[amulet of reflection]] or a [[bag of holding]] (both especially useful to a lycanthrope), as well as a number of wands, potions, and rings.

===Mid to late game===
Once you have a steady food supply, your main goal should be to find a [[ring of polymorph control]] to gain full control over your were-changes so you can wear your [[ascension kit]]. Ideally, you should stash anything you can't carry or use in wolf form, and simply stay a wolf unless you need to use your hands (e.g. to open a door or bag).

Once you have a ring of polymorph control, your game will play pretty much like any other race except for the lycanthrope benefits. Fast [[regeneration]], guaranteed pets including [[winter wolf|winter wolves]], #youpoly to remove cursed armor, innately high physical stats, and two race-specific techniques can lead to a very potent character from the midgame on.

The lycanthrope starting race existed in early versions of [[SpliceHack]], but was removed. Thus it is a [[defunct features (SpliceHack)|defunct starting race in SpliceHack]].

&&%s&& %s Storm {139987 2021-05-18T04:41:50Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* DaggerStorm */ [[backstab]] page says it was nerfed in 3.6.0 '''ArrowStorm''', '''DaggerStorm''', or '''SilverStorm''' are the use of [[Missile|missile weapons]] as the primary way to deal damage in NetHack.

The preferred roles to do this are [[Rogue|Rogues]] and [[Ranger|Rangers]], for their [[Skill|weapon proficiency]] and for their +1 [[Multishot|multishot]] bonus, but roles with high skill in missile weapons also work (particularly [[Wizard|Wizards]], [[Tourist|Tourists]] and [[Valkyrie|Valkyries]] for Expert daggers). In addition, a [[Ring of increase damage]] would also be of considerable benefit since the damage bonus will be added to '''each''' projectile.
== DaggerStorm ==
As a Ranger or a Rogue you get +1 multishot for thrown [[Dagger|daggers]], even when dagger is Unskilled, so, even as an early-game character, you can probably deal more damage by throwing daggers than by using a melee weapon, even in melee range.

The best type of daggers to do this is probably the silver dagger, due to his high damage [[Silver damage|bonus]] (+1d20) against the silver-hating monsters, but since they are hard to find, most people end up using a stack of elven daggers or just plain normal daggers.

Rogues also get a backstab bonus (+1dXL) against fleeing monsters (pre-[[3.6.0]]), for '''each''' thrown dagger; in the end game, the damage of a stack of thrown, enchanted silver daggers against a fleeing silver-hating undead, assuming that every projectile hits and the character has maximum [[Strength|strength]], as a level 30 Rogue with Expert dagger skill:
  2       skill bonus
 +6       strength bonus
 +2.5     average of 1d4 against small monsters, becomes 1d3 (2) against large
 +7       enchantment
 +10.5    average of 1d20 silver damage against silver-haters
 +2.5     average of 1d4 blessed damage against undead
 +15.5    average of 1d30 backstab damage against fleeing monsters
 =45.5    average for a single blessed +7 silver dagger against a fleeing small silver-hating undead
 *2.5     1d4 daggers thrown in a single firing
 =113.75  *average* final damage (112.5 against large, absolute best case is 292! damage)

In [[3.6.0]] and later, [[backstab]] does not apply to thrown weapons, so the average final damage is instead 30*2.5=75 against small monsters, and 73.75 against large.

Compare this to the average damage for [[Grayswandir]], the best weapon in the game, [[Twoweapon|twoweaponing]] it with another silver saber, with maxed skills (assuming, with the same Rogue, Expert two-weapon combat and Skilled saber):
 2*(      Grayswandir's double damage
  4.5     average of 1d8 against any
 +7       enchantment
 )
 +6       strength bonus
 +10.5    average of 1d20 silver damage against silver-haters
 +2.5     average of 1d4 blessed damage against undead
 +
  4.5     average of 1d8 against any
 +7       enchantment
 +6       strength bonus
 +10.5    average of 1d20 silver damage against silver-haters
 +2.5     average of 1d4 blessed damage against undead
 =72.5    average of the blessed +7 Grayswandir twoweapon with a blessed +7 silver saber against a silver-hating undead
That said, a stack of silver daggers is one of the rarest item in the [[Mazes of Menace]] (stacks of 1d6 silver daggers are 0.3% of all the randomly-generated items), so most adventurers will settle for a stack of daggers, or elven daggers when possible, but even in that case, it's usually enough to kill most monsters before they even have a chance of landing a hit on you, since daggers are a ranged attacks, with the range depending purely on your strength (with St:25 you have 10 squares of range).

Unless you're using silver daggers, if there are spare scrolls of enchant weapon laying around, it's better to [[Fooproof]] your stack of enchanted daggers, since a lot of monsters can corrode iron, limiting your damage; it's also better to [[Name|#name]] your stack of daggers giving it a unique name, and to set an autopickup exception for your own daggers, to help picking them up. Also, watch out when firing around water, since daggers that end up in a pool or a moat are hard to recover; better have a backup melee weapon for sea monsters.

One of the advantages of throwing daggers, as opposed to using a melee weapon, is the fact that you can use a wielded [[Artifact weapon|artifact weapon]] for the bonus it provides, and not just for the damage; [[Magicbane]]'s damage is low, compared to other artifacts, but the perks it gives ([[Magic resistance|MR]] and curse absorbing) are nice; Magicbane is a great weapon, even for Rogues (chaotics) because it also gives you a way to engrave a semipermanent Elbereth - great for the backstab bonus. Another way to scare monsters, that works at range, is a [[Tooled horn|tooled horn]], which is another great tool for Rogues.

== ArrowStorm ==
Another great alternative to melee weapons, especially if you are an [[Elf (starting race)|Elven]] Ranger, are elven arrows, fired from an elven bow: Rangers get a +1 multishot for every projectile, and Elves have a +1 multishot (together with a +1 to-hit and +1 damage) for firing elven arrows from an elven bow, bringing the average fired projectiles to 3.

In the early game, using daggers is probably the best choice, since they don't break, but as soon as you can rotproof, enchant (+2 or more), bless and get high [[Luck]] (9 or higher) arrows pretty much never break, so you can ditch the daggers and start accumulating arrows (they are *way* lighter - 25 daggers weigh the same as 250 arrows). Note that enchanting the bow only adds to the to-hit bonus, not to the damage, so enchanting the bow is mostly useless). You can also poison arrows, by [[Dip|#dipping]] a stack of arrows into a potion of sickness, adding damage against non-poison resistant monsters, and giving a chance of instakilling them; note that using poisoned weapons as a Lawful gives you -1 [[Alignment record|alignment]].

Damage calculation for blessed poisoned +7 elven arrows, fired from an elven bow as an Elven Ranger, with Expert bow skill:
  2       skill bonus 
 +1       racial bonus
 +4       average of 1d7 against small, becomes 1d6 (3.5) against large
 +7       enchantment
 +3.5     average of 1d6 poison damage against non-poison resistant
 =17.5    average for a single blessed poisoned +7 elven arrow
 *3       average of 1d5 fired arrows in a single firing 
 =52.5    average final damage (51 against large)
This applies when attacking normal enemies that are not poison-resistant, not including a 10% chance of instakilling with poison - with 14 poisoned arrows you have over 50% chance of killing an enemy, regardless of damage. Undead and demons are poison-resistant, but they suffer from the blessed damage (2.5 average). Using a launcher gives you extended range of fire, so you can get even more shots at monsters while they come to you.

Firing poisonous arrows can remove the poison coating, so after a while you may want to re-dip your de-poisoned arrows in another potion of sickness to bring the stack back together.

== SilverStorm ==
A way to get the "best of both worlds" is using [[Silver arrow|silver arrows]] with a bow, usually the [[Longbow of Diana]] as a Ranger. Still way lighter than daggers, there's no need to Fooproof them, they can be poisoned and they deal silver damage against silver-haters. Again, avoid using them until you have maxed your luck and blessed them, enchanted silver arrows deal a damage comparable to a rogue throwing silver daggers:
  2       skill bonus
 +3.5     average of 1d6 against any
 +7       enchantment
 +10.5    average of 1d20 silver damage against silver-haters
 +2.5     average of 1d4 blessed damage against undead
 =25.5    average for a single blessed poisoned +7 silver arrow
 *2.5     average of 1d4 fired arrows in a single firing
 =63.75   average final damage
Again, this is for a maximum range of 11, so, especially if you're [[Fast|fast]] or very fast, you have the time of killing monsters before they get even near you. The same advices regarding missile managing apply here.

'''Thiefbane''' is always generated in the inventory of [[One-Eyed Sam]] (unless wished for before Sam is generated). Thiefbane is typically generated with an [[enchantment]], but the greater prize is the [[instadeath]] by decapitation (10% chance) on monsters symbolized by [[@]]. Thiefbane also has a 1 in 6 chance of [[canceling]] whatever it hits, which is probably you.{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|1206|unnethack=1406}}

Note that Thiefbane may [[Artifact blast|blast]] you, even if you are chaotic.

== Acquiring Thiefbane ==
Given that One-eyed Sam is level 24 and carries most of an ascension kit, it's usually a bad idea to simply engage her in melee. A [[scroll of earth]] or [[scroll of flood]] may fix One-eyed Sam on her spot (assuming she is not flying), and highly enchanted firearms or poisoned darts work fine for the kill. More suggestions can be found at the [[black market]] page.

However, this is not neccessary to acquire Thiefbane. If you are appropriately fast, armored, brave, or stupid, and you have the [[disarm (technique)|disarm]] [[technique]] and can hit with something you are at least skilled in, you can steal Thiefbane. Be aware that you still risk decapitation. If you try that, you will need an escape plan that works despite the [[black market]]'s restrictions. One way is to apply (break) a wand of digging, trapping her (away from the door).  Note that unless you are wearing an [[amulet of life saving]], you don't really need an escape plan, since you won't be around to use it.

== UnNetHack ==
In [[UnNetHack]], Thiefbane's base item class has been changed to [[two-handed sword]] and the player is in danger of being decapitated even if not in a form symbolized by {{kbd|@}}.

As if that's not hard enough, UnNethack does not allow Thiefbane to be wished for (the code calls this <code>wishing abuse</code>).{{refsrc|src/objnam.c|3036|unnethack=1406}} So you're going to have to fight her ''and'' her sword.

The '''Bat from Hell''' is an [[artifact]] [[baseball bat]] introduced in [[SLASH'EM]] and included in [[SpliceHack]]. It gets +3 to-hit and +20 damage bonus, making it a weapon suitable even for SLASH'EM's endgame. It uses the [[club]] skill. In SLASH'EM, it is the first [[sacrifice gift]] for [[Rogue]]s.

==Obtaining==
Rogues can get this weapon as their first sacrifice gift. Other chaotic characters may receive it from sacrifice, but all others will have to wish for it or find it in a bones pile. Since its base item type is never randomly generated, it cannot be randomly generated either.

==Strategy==
The Bat from Hell is one of the strongest artifact weapons available in SLASH'EM. Its +20 damage bonus versus all enemies is matched only by [[Reaper]], and as Reaper is a pole-arm it is both two-handed and can only be used for mounted combat or pounding. The Bat makes the Rogue role much easier in SLASH'EM, combined with the other advantages they are given; a Rogue's only goal in SLASH'EM's early game is almost certainly going to be to find an altar and sacrifice everything in sight. It makes the early game relatively easy, felling most monsters in one or two hits, but one should always be careful not to be overconfident; the Bat does not make you invulnerable.

The Bat is something that many roles may find it worthwhile to wish for, although it is not strictly speaking an essential. Even non-chaotics might want to wish for it; it is not an [[intelligent]] artifact, although one should be mindful that [[artifact blast#SLASH'EM|blasting damage]] has been considerably increased for all artifacts in SLASH'EM. Also, for those roles that can manage it, it may be worthwhile to #twoweapon the Bat with an artifact that provides drain resistance, since that will not compromise its increased damage.

Both [[Mjollnir]] at +24 and [[Disrupter]] at +30 have higher damage bonuses than the Bat, but Mjollnir's damage bonus doesn't apply to shock-resistant monsters, and Disrupter's only applies to undead.

==SpliceHack==
In SpliceHack, the Bat from Hell is not affiliated with Rogues. The flat +20 damage bonus is reduced to +1d20.

A rot worm, {{Monsym/rot worm}}, is a monster in SLASH'EM.  It is very weak, but its bite can make you [[sickness|ill]].

==Generation==
Although not normally randomly generated, spellcasting monsters can create them via [[summon nasties]], meaning they are a reasonably common sight in the middle to late game.  They also appear in [[the Wyrm Caves]] and the [[Lawful Quest]].

==Strategy==
Rot worms are capable of dealing delayed instadeath to any character without [[sickness resistance]], and it is often quite easy to overlook the "deathly sick" message amidst all the other battle spam.  Thus, if a [[demilich]] summons one, be sure to use your unicorn horn after the fight, as sickness has no further messages, unlike [[stoning]], and it is far too easy to overlook the "Ill" indicator on the status bar.

Wax golems are typically seen in the early levels of SLASH'EM.  Their attacks can destroy scrolls and potions, but otherwise they are not a huge threat.  They drop [[wax candle]]s when destroyed.  This makes them potentially valuable as a non-conduct-violating source of candles in those games where [[Izchak]]'s lighting store doesn't have enough.

Ruby golems are the first of SLASH'EM's highly dangerous gemstone golems.  They do large amounts of physical damage, and resist most magical attacks.  Fortunately, they are not very fast, and any player with [[speed]] can outrun them.  They always drop [[ruby|rubies]]; in general, the gemstone golems are quite useful to identify valuable gems.

More dangerous than a ruby golem, as they are magic resistant on top of being stronger.  They drop diamonds when destroyed.

Similar to the previous two, only still more dangerous.  Their bodies also have [[reflection]].

Steel golems are probably the largest threat of SLASH'EM's new golems.  While they do slightly less damage than the crystal golem, they more than make up for it with their passive [[disenchanter|disenchant]] attack.  They are sufficiently dangerous that it is difficult to use a junk weapon (such as a [[pick-axe]]) to destroy them, but they will generally be able to remove some enchantment from your main weapon if you attack them with it.  Fortunately, they appear rarely enough that you should only need a couple of spare [[scroll of enchant weapon|scrolls of enchant weapon]] or [[magic marker]]s handy.  They drop [[iron chain]]s when destroyed.
