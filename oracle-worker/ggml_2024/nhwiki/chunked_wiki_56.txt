‡ Hack for PDP-11 replaced the [[scroll of confuse monster]] with a scroll of losing.  The porters to PC/IX reinstated the former as a potion.

===Scrolls===
Available scrolls are as follows.  The Hack121 list is ordered in an attempt to match the other two.

For PDP-11:
* The "scroll of losing" takes away the hero's entire inventory and scatters it about the level.  It is noted in source code comments as replacing the scroll of confuse monster.
* The "scroll of curse levels" appears to curse the hero himself, causing shopkeepers to be angry and all picked-up items to become cursed.  The scroll of remove curse will rescind this effect, and in these versions it is not itself affected by curses.  
* The scroll of transportation, as well as teleporting, functions as an elevator.  The code carries the notice "Extended by Michiel and Fred: One can jump between levels".

===Wands===
Available wands are as follows.  The Hack121 list is reordered in an attempt to match the other two:

In Hack121, the wand of wonder is a random wand of another type which changes each time you zap it.  In D&amp;D, a wand of wonder works as a random wand of another type.  

''Note: In iLarn (and in [http://www.cordier.com/ularn/ ULarn]), a wand of wonder prevents the player from falling down holes when in the main inventory.  It could serve the same purpose here, as this would not be very apparent to most players.''

It is uncertain if the hack121 ring of protection from magic has any connection to the ring of protection from shape changers in the other versions.

===Gems===
Hack121 appears to have gems, but their function is uncertain.  In Hack for PDP-11, they only add to the player's score; neither of these Hacks has unicorns.  Hack 1.0 has gems in their modern form.

===Other objects===
The remaining objects in each game seem to have no connection to each other.  Hack121 has these objects:
*the sphere of power
*[[mirror]]
*cross
*tinder box
*[[brass lantern|lantern]]
*torch
*[[potion of oil|flask of oil]]
*shield (which is not a type of armor in this game)

Hack for PDP-11 only has the "amulet of Frobozz", which may be the forerunner of the [[Amulet of Yendor]].

Hack 1.0 has these objects:
*[[tin whistle|whistle]]
*[[magic whistle]]
*[[expensive camera]]
*[[ice box]]
*[[heavy iron ball]]
*[[iron chain]]
*[[boulder|enormous rock]]
*[[amulet of Yendor]]

'''The Palantir of Westernesse''' was the [[Elf (role)|Elf]] [[quest artifact]] that previously appeared in ''[[NetHack]]''. It served as the prize for completing the [[Elf quest]] and defeating the [[quest nemesis]], the [[Goblin King]]. It was [[chaotic]] for [[wishing]] purposes, and its [[base item]] was a [[crystal ball]].

When carried, the Palantir of Westernesse granted [[regeneration]], [[telepathy]], and [[half spell damage]]. When [[invoked]], it [[taming|tamed]] nearby creatures.

==History==
The Palantir was introduced in [[NetHack 3.1.0]], and last appeared in [[NetHack 3.2.3]] - it was rendered [[defunct]] along with the Elf role in [[NetHack 3.3.0]], which introduced the ability to choose a starting race, including [[Elf (starting race)|the elf]]. The role itself was given a spiritual successor in the [[Ranger]], whose [[Ranger quest|quest branch]] employs a somewhat similar structure and uses the exact same layout for the goal level, though [[The Longbow of Diana|the quest artifact]] and [[Scorpius|the nemesis guarding it]] are much different.

The data for the Palantir can still be found within artilist.h in the code of 3.3.0 and later versions.{{refsrc|include/artilist.h|186|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Palantír}}
A '''palantír''' (/ˈpælənˌtɪər/; pl. palantíri) is a magical artifact from the setting of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s Middle-earth novels. It is an indestructible ball of crystal, used for communicating and viewing past and future events in other parts of Arda. The palantíri were made by the Elves of Valinor in the First Age - by the time of ''The Lord of the Rings'', only a few remained in existence.

Various major characters make use of palantíri, and a major recurring theme is that users had to "possess great strength of will and of mind" to direct the stone's gaze to its full capability. Others would find the stones unreliable, since it was unclear whether the events shown were from the past or future - users with sufficient power could take advantage of this if they chose to.

Palantíri are the basis for [[Elvenking]]s in ''NetHack'' having a 2% chance to generate with a crystal ball. Elves are also the only starting race that can ''naturally'' reach an [[Intelligence]] of 20, which allows crystal balls to be [[applied]] without any chance of failure.

==Variants==
A few modern variants still retain and/or retool the Palantir of Westernesse in some manner.

===NetHack Plus/SLASH 6===
In [[NetHack Plus]], the Palantir of Westernesse was made lawful to reflect the Elf role being lawful instead of chaotic. [[SLASH 6]] retained this while making the Elf role open to all alignments. Their successor [[SLASH'EM]] did not retain the role or its artifact in versions based on 3.3.0 and later.

===SlashTHEM===
In older versions of [[SlashTHEM]], the [[Elph]] role was a retool of the old Elf role, and the Palantir of Westernesse served as the quest artifact.

===dNetHack===
[[dNetHack]] retools the old Elf quest as the [[Elvish Racial Quest]], where elven [[Noble]]s, [[Priest]]s, Rangers, and [[Wizard]]s face the [[Necromancer (Quest Nemesis)|Necromancer]] for the Palantir of Westernesse. The Palantir remains a chaotic, elf-favoring intelligent crystal ball - when carried, it grants x-ray vision, telepathy, [[warning]], and [[reflection]]. Invoking the artifact can tame nearby monsters.

A '''hobbit''', {{monsym|hobbit}}, is one of the monsters you will encounter a few floors down in the NetHack dungeon.

[[Chat]]ting with a peaceful or tame hobbit gives the message "<monster> asks you about the One Ring." It could give the message "<monster> complains about unpleasant dungeon conditions." if the hobbit is at least 10 HP down from its maximum, but hobbits almost never have enough HP to survive that much damage.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Hobbits now complain about any damage, if they have less than 11 max HP.}}

== Generation ==

Hobbits will always be [[monster starting inventory|generated with]] one of a [[dagger]], an [[elven dagger]], or a [[sling]] (but no [[rock]]s), with an equal chance of receiving any of them.  In addition, they have a 10% chance of receiving an [[elven mithril coat]], and a 10% chance of receiving a [[dwarvish cloak]].{{refsrc|makemon.c|288}}  They also enjoy collecting things off the floor, so one may frequently find other random items in their inventories.

They are usually - but not always - [[peaceful]] for [[lawful]] characters.

== Strategy ==

Hobbits are useful as potential early sources of a mithril-coat, or daggers to fill your quiver or turn into [[Sting]]. If you're lawful and don't want to take the [[alignment record]] penalty for killing a peaceful monster, any pet should be able to make short work of it.

== Variants ==

=== EvilHack ===
{{main|EvilHack#New_player_races}}
In [[EvilHack]], hobbits are a possible starting race.

=== SLASH'EM ===
{{main|Hobbit (starting race)}}
In [[SLASH'EM]], hobbits are a possible starting race.

=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]] Nazgul will attack any [[Hobbit]]s they see, (and vice versa) as part of Nephi's grudge patch.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
and quiet and good tilled earth:  a well-ordered and well-
farmed countryside was their favourite haunt.  They do not
and did not understand or like machines more complicated
than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a handloom, although
they were skillful with tools.  Even in ancient days they
were, as a rule, shy of "the Big Folk", as they call us, and
now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find.

{{stub}}
A member of the {{white|M}} '''mummy''' [[monster class]], is simply an artificially preserved version of another monster and superficially similar to [[zombie]]s. However, Mummies tend to be stronger than their corresponding zombies.

Although mummies have been preserved, their flesh is nonetheless pre-aged and thus unsuitable for [[sacrifice|sacrificing]], except for [[Sacrifice#Sacrificing_creatures_of_own_race|same-race sacrifices]]. They are also [[tainted]], so consumption is only safe if their flesh is [[Tinning kit|tinned]] first. You can eat corpses from mummies without tinning them, if you manage to cure yourself - using a [[unicorn horn]], the [[spellbook of cure sickness|cure sickness spell]], or [[prayer]] - before you die of food poisoning, but this is a risky strategy, and any [[intrinsic]]s you might gain from eating raw mummy could probably be obtained more easily and safely from another source.

All mummies are [[cold resistance|cold resistant]].

If a player gets killed by a mummy, the bones file of that person will contain a mummy instead of a [[ghost]]. The character's items will then appear in the mummy's inventory rather than in a loot pile, so mummies in bones levels must usually be killed to get the late player's things.

[[Monster_starting_inventory|Mummies are generated with]], unsurprisingly, a [[mummy wrapping]] (86% chance).

{{clear}}

==Origin==

A mummy is a corpse that has been preserved in some way, whether because of deliberate preparation (mummification) or because of environmental factors (such as low temperature or lack of moisture or oxygen) that prevented or slowed decomposition. The assumption that mummification rituals were intended to keep the body intact for eternity probably inspired the fictional concept of the undead mummy that can be reanimated because of the charms placed on it.

Mummies as a type of [[undead]] creature are sometimes only distinguishable from mindless [[zombie]]s or fully sentient [[lich]]es by being wrapped in cloth bandages. This image comes mainly from the mummies made by the ancient Egyptians, which were usually wrapped in linen. Not all cultures that practiced mummification used wrappings, however, and the term "mummy" is also applied to bodies that were preserved unintentionally, without preparations such as wrappings. 

Mummies in NetHack are similar to Egyptian mummies in that they are [[mummy wrapping|wrapped]], but they are probably not embalmed using strict Egyptian practices. NetHack mummies have brains that can be eaten by [[mind flayer]]s; the Egyptian practice was to remove the brain before burial.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
But for an account of the manner in which the body was
bandaged, and a list of the unguents and other materials
employed in the process, and the words of power which were
spoken as each bandage was laid in its place, we must have
recourse to a very interesting papyrus which has been edited
and translated by M. Maspero under the title of Le Rituel de
l'Embaumement. ...
Everything that could be done to preserve the body was now
done, and every member of it was, by means of the words of
power which changed perishable substances into imperishable,
protected to all eternity; when the final covering of purple
or white linen had been fastened upon it, the body was ready
for the tomb.

=== SpliceHack ===
In [[SpliceHack]], all {{white|M}}-class monsters can cause [[withering]]. Giant mummies also gain the ability to knock the player back several spaces, similar to other [[giant]]s in SpliceHack.

SpliceHack also adds a new mummy called the [[adherer]], which can disarm enemies and has a [[sticky]] attack.

The '''small shield''' is the cheapest and lightest kind of [[shield]].

Unless made [[fireproof]] or rotproof, it can burn or rot when faced with [[fire]] or a [[black pudding]]/[[brown pudding]]'s attack.

It does not inhibit [[spellcasting]] as much as the other shields due to its small weight.{{refsrc|src/spell.c|1802|nethack=3.6.6|comment=extra shield penalty doesn't apply for small shields}}

==Generation==
[[Knight]]s and [[priest]]s start out with one, as well as [[valkyrie]]s (theirs is enchanted +3 from the beginning).

[[Mercenary|Mercenaries]] are also generated with small shields sometimes.

==Strategy==
{{main|Shield#Strategy|l1=Shield § Strategy}}
The small shield is the best shield for spellcasters and characters with low [[carrying capacity]].

A Valkyrie's starting small shield is worth wearing for a long time due to its high enchantment. Eventually, Valkyries will probably want to ditch the shield so they can [[twoweapon]].

There are three '''unlocking tools''' in ''[[NetHack]]'': the '''skeleton key''', the '''lock pick''' ('''osaku''' to [[Samurai]]) and the '''credit card'''. The skeleton key and the lock pick are the only items allowing you to lock ''and'' unlock [[door]]s and [[chest]]s. Credit cards can only unlock doors and chests, as a reference to their popularity in films for jimmying open door locks.

''NetHack'' has two [[artifact]] unlocking tools: [[The Master Key of Thievery]] and [[The Platinum Yendorian Express Card]].

==Generation==
All unlocking tools are generated uncursed unless found on a [[bones]] level; since [[3.6.1]], they can also be found among the cursed items in the "bones" generated on some [[trap]]s. 

==Effects==

===Usage===
To unlock doors, [[apply]] the unlocking tool and then choose the direction of the door. To unlock chests, apply the unlocking tool while standing on the chest and then choose "&gt;", for down or ".", for here.

The chance of successfully locking or unlocking a door depends on which tool you use, your [[dexterity]], the type of lock, and whether or not you are a [[Rogue]]. The per-turn probabilities of success are listed in the table below. A cursed unlocking tool will also have a halved chance of success, applied after all other modifiers.

For Rogues, the lock pick has a higher (un)locking chance than the key for boxes at dexterity 17 or higher, and for doors at dexterity 21 or higher (usually achievable only with [[gauntlets of dexterity]]). For non-rogues, the key is better than the lock-pick except at normally unreachable dexterity levels, and in all cases the lock-pick has better chances than the credit card.

If you have not succeeded after 50 turns, you give up. This [[exercise]]s your [[strength]] if using a non-bladed weapon, and exercises [[dexterity]] if using a tool or bladed weapon; the exercise is only counted once you've succeeded or given up. each failed attempt is worth nothing alone.

When unlocking chests and boxes with bladed weapons vs. other weapons, the chance of succeeding is the same, but the effects are different. Edged weapons have a small chance of breaking on every failed unlock attempt. Non-edged weapons have a 33% chance of damaging the chest, which destroys the lock completely; in that case, all potions within are broken, along with a 33% chance of breaking every other item.

The message given varies depending on the material involved, as detailed below, and occurs in the form "A(n) <item> <message>!" (e.g. "An orange potion shatters!")

===Onlookers===
If a [[watchman]] sees you picking a lock, he may warn you or become [[hostile]]. If a warning is given, a trap is automatically added to the door in question.

Attempting to apply a credit card at a shopkeeper or the Oracle will produce the message "No checks, no credit, no problem." Attempting to apply an unlocking tool on a visible monster (other than a disguised mimic) in any other situation will produce the message "I don't think ''<monster>'' would appreciate that.".

===Monster use===
Some monsters with unlocking tools in their inventories may use them to unlock doors. <ref>{{sourcecode|monmove.c|43|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}</ref>

==Strategy==
Credit cards are the lightest unlocking tool, but also the slowest, and cannot re-lock objects like the others. Lock picks are the heaviest and most expensive, and for a Rogue with 18 dexterity they give a 97% chance of (un)locking a box in one turn. However, in all other circumstances, skeleton keys are faster, as well as cheaper and lighter.

Being corroded or rusted does not impede the operation of any unlocking tool; however, [[BUC|cursed]] tools have only half the chance of unlocking that uncursed tools have.

While it is possible and sometimes reasonable to kick down doors, especially when without an unlocking tool, it has some adverse consequences.
* Kicking wakes up nearby monsters. This includes the fabled invisible [[nymph]]. (This can have a major effect on your game, and is one of the main reasons you might choose to avoid kicking doors.)
* You cannot close and/or lock doors to partition out spawned monsters if you have kicked them down (unless you have the [[wizard lock]] spell or a [[wand of locking]]).
* For characters with low [[Strength]] and [[Constitution]], kicking can take longer, unless wearing kicking boots. (Note that for characters with high values in those physical statistics, even an unlocked door can be faster to kick down than to open naturally if approached on the diagonal, because open doors, as opposed to destroyed doors, must be approached orthogonally.)
* The door might be attached to a shop [[closed for inventory]]. (You can check this by examining the square orthogonally next to the door using the <code>:</code> command, except in a few corner cases related to [[bones]] levels.)
* Kicking doors is impossible while [[riding]] or [[levitation|levitating]].

==History==
All the unlocking tools first appear in [[NetHack 3.0.0]]. In addition, the NetHack 3.0 Series had special shaped keys that fit specific locks on chests and [[large box]]es. For example, you might see "a chest (triangular keyhole)", for example, and a "triangular key" would open its lock much more quickly than a skeleton key, but a "square key" would not fit.

Doors did not have locks of any specific shape, and the shaped keys could not open them; you had to use one of the other unlocking tools.

Keys, and the locks that they fit, were as follows in [[NetHack 3.0.10]]:
