                  Elsif The bell is cursed:
                   (level_difficulty() + 1)/10 + d5 undead are created.
                  Elsif on the Vibrating square:
                   "The Bell of Opening issues an unsettling shrill sound..."
                    You have completed one of the three tasks required for
                   "opening" the square.
                 
                  Of course, the bell opens stuff.

   level_difficulty(): If in endgame: = sanctumlevel + XPlev/2
                       Else: If you have the Amulet: = deepest lev. reached by U
                             Else: = dungeon level you're on.

 raise dead:     "You turn the pages of the Book of the Dead..."

                 If you're on the Vibrating square AND:
                  None of Book,Bell or Candelabrum are cursed, the Candelabrum
                  is lit and the Bell is recently rung: You "open" the stairs to
                  the sanctum.

                 When you read the Book of the Dead without being on the
                 vibrating square, it still has some specials...

                 If the Book is cursed: "You raised the dead!"
                  There is a 1/3 chance of a Master Lich or Nalfeshnee being
                  created. Then one egg/corpse from each inventory slot will
                  be reanimated.
                  Lastly some random undead creatures are made.
                        (Same no. as when ringing the cursed bell)

                 If the Book is blessed:
                  Undead creatures within sight are made peaceful.
                  Next to you & co-aligned:
                   Your pet undead is made a bit more tame, and if you
                   have same alignment a taming is attempted.
                  Otherwise:
                   It is made scared.

                 If the Book is uncursed:(three possible messiages)
                  "Your ancestors are annoyed with you!"
                  "The headstones in the cemetery begin to move!"
                  "Oh my!  Your name appears in the book!"

 summon-undead:  If your luck is < -9: "The Hand claws you with its icy nails!"
                  You get d20 +4 damage!
                 Else: "Creatures from the grave surround you!"
                  You summon d4 +3 random tame undead monsters!
                  Equal chances of: Vampires, Zombies, Mummies, Ghosts or
                  Wraiths.

        It seems they've been removed. Too bad, "Scalpel" seemed fun :-(
        Atleast "Scalpel" and "Cat's claw" added something to the game, the
        usefulness of "Cat's Claw" is limited though.

'''Itlachiayaque''' is an [[artifact]] introduced in [[L (person)|L]]'s Itlachiayaque Patch, where it acts as a replacement for the [[Archeologist]] [[quest artifact]], [[the Orb of Detection]]. Itlachiayaque replaces the Orb of Detection in [[UnNetHack]], [[dNetHack]], [[Fourk]], [[xNetHack]], and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is [[lawful]] for wishing purposes, and its [[base item]] is a [[shield of reflection]].

==Effects==
When carried, Itlachiayaque confers [[ESP]], [[fire resistance]] and [[half spell damage]]—additionally, it does not inhibit [[spellcasting]] for an Archeologist wearing it. When [[invoke]]d, it duplicates the effects of a blessed [[scroll of stinking cloud]], allowing the player to create a temporary seven-tile diameter mass of [[poison cloud]]s. Archaeologists invoking the artifact in UnNetHack and xNetHack can center it on a designated visible tile—other roles will end up being the "target" of the resulting cloud.

In [[xNetHack]], Itlachiayaque has quite a few differences from other variants—it is made out of [[gold (material)|gold]] and confers [[warning]] and fire resistance while carried, rather than ESP and half spell damage. When invoked, it prompts the player to choose from two different effects: they can create a poison cloud as normal, or gaze into the surface to look for an object, monster, or furniture symbol just like a [[crystal ball]].

==Strategy==
Itlachiayaque effectively exchanges the Orb's [[magic resistance]] for [[reflection]], but at the cost of blocking the player's off-hand for [[twoweapon]]ing Archeologists and other roles. Fire resistance, telepathy and half spell damage are welcome, though the former can easily be acquired intrinsically before the quest in most variants. The invoke ability is an improvement on the Orb's [[invisibility]]—the stinking cloud is efficient in clearing masses of enemies that lack poison resistance, and should be useful in [[barracks]] and [[treasure zoo]]s.

Players should be warned that the quest nemesis, the [[Minion of Huhetotl]], is almost guaranteed to put on the shield and subsequently benefit from its reflection—avoid using ray attacks that can be reflected back at you.

==Origin==
Itlachiayaque is the name of an object, either a mirror or a shield, carried by the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca (whose name literally translates to "fiery mirror").

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Tezcatlipoca (Fiery Mirror) was undoubtedly the Jupiter of the
Nahua pantheon. He carried a mirror or shield [ Itlachiayaque ],
from which he took his name, and in which he was supposed to see
reflected the actions and deeds of mankind. The evolution of this
god from the status of a spirit of wind or air to that of the
supreme deity of the Aztec people presents many points of deep
interest to students of mythology.

'''Toves''' are a new type of "Jabberwockian" that can be encountered in [[dNetHack]]. On every move, they have a 5% chance of digging a [[pit]] in the ground ("The tove gyres and gimbles into the ground"). If a tove digs in a square that already contains a pit, it creates a [[hole]] and falls through to the next level. Toves can only dig downward; they cannot [[tunnel]] through walls. They are immune to grab and swallowing attacks.

Toves are a valid polymorph form.  A player polymorphed into a tove can dig with #[[Monster (command)|monster]], is immune to grab and swallowing attacks, and can also quickly open tins without a tin opener.

Contrary to their encyclopedia entry and source material, toves are not [[slithy]].

The '''jubjub bird''' is a monster in [[dNetHack]]. They periodically "scream shrill and high", frightening all monsters on the level and [[stun]]ning the player character. Any pets that are frightened by the scream also have their [[tameness]] ''increased'' by one.

A blessed [[tin]] of jubjub bird meat is "symmetrical" and particularly nutritious, giving 600 [[nutrition]] and acting as a single-use [[unicorn horn]].

A player polymorphed into a jubjub bird can use the #monster command to scream.

{{encyclopedia|
	But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
		And the evening got darker and colder,
	Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)
		They marched along shoulder to shoulder.
	Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
		And they knew that some danger was near:
	The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
		And even the Butcher felt queer.
	[...]
	Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
		Have seldom if ever been known;
