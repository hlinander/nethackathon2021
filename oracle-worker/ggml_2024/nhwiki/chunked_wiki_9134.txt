[[SLASH'EM]] introduces four new '''[[werecreature]]s''': the werepanther, weretiger, weresnake and werespider. Only the first two are randomly generated, while the werespider can sometimes be found in the [[Special level (SLASH'EM)#Spider caves|Spider caves]]. Oddly enough, unlike other lycanthropes, the animal form of the werespider is genocidable.

Enemy werecreatures also function differently in SLASH'EM: all polymorphed monsters, including lycanthropes, revert to their human forms when killed. Unfortunately, lycanthropes will then often quickly turn back into animals, which must (again) be killed to turn them back into human form, after which they can be banished permanently.

Werewolves in SLASH'EM do not always start hostile, and Chaotic players may see peaceful randomly generated werewolves.

The werespider is an interesting type; the spider form is considered [[oviparous]], so it is possible to acquire lycanthropy as a werespider and lay eggs that will hatch into tame werespiders.

==Strategy==
One must be careful around even [[wererat]]s in SLASH'EM.  Although the early lycanthropes are not strong, the reversion property can make it so you have to kill them many times before they are gone. Because of this, they are about the most dangerous of SLASH'EM's early monsters. Like most introduced [[monster (SLASH'EM)|SLASH'EM monsters]], the new lycanthropes are also far more dangerous than their vanilla counterparts. The werepanther is probably the greatest new threat, as it tends to appear somewhat early (often as early as the [[mall]] or [[Minetown]], and often at the [[The Oracle]]); it hits very hard, summons hard-hitting [[panther]]s and [[jaguar]]s, and at [[speed]] 15 it can outrun a player without [[speed boots]]. For this reason, you should always use the farlook command to identify any feline at a distance, and not be afraid at all to run away.

To fight lycanthropes in SLASH'EM, it is most important to be able to do damage quickly enough to destroy the human form before it reverts back (again) to animal form. In addition, there are some other techniques that are useful for fighting them. Luckily, no lycanthrope can follow you to other levels, so retreat is usually an option if you are close enough to the stairs.

===Silver===
Silver is one of the better ways of dealing with lycanthropes in SLASH'EM, as the d20 extra damage can wipe out a lower-level lycanthrope in one hit, and both human and animal forms of lycanthropes are affected by silver. Luckily, there are more types of silver weapons in SLASH'EM, and thus it is more likely to find one. Also keep in mind that silver non-weapon items or ammunition can be equally potent, provided you can hit with them. Note that silver rings will do silver damage when worn (not wielded) as long as you're not wearing gloves.

===Ring of protection from shape changers===
The [[ring of protection from shape changers]] is considerably more useful in SLASH'EM; while not necessarily easier to identify, it becomes a much more fortuitous discovery, as it forces all [[shapeshifter]]s into their "natural" form, including lycanthropes. As such, you only have to kill them once; in addition, they are unable to confer [[lycanthropy]] or summon help in their human form.

===Ranged weapons===
Fighting lycanthropes [[ranged weapon|at a distance]] is quite valuable, as not only are they unable to confer lycanthropy except through melee attacks, they also cannot summon help at a distance. With multishot bonuses, some roles might be able to do more damage fighting with a [[bow]] or [[dagger]]s than a melee weapon; maximizing damage if of the utmost importance against lycanthropes. [[Silver arrow]]s are a particularly potent option.

===Elbereth===
Although their human forms will not respect [[Elbereth]], animal lycanthropes and their summoned friends will, so even an Elbereth written in the dust can give you breathing room and allow you to plan either your escape or the lycanthrope's demise.

A pixie is a one of several nymph-based monsters introduced in [[SLASH'EM]]. While it has only one seduction attack to the nymph's two, it is slightly faster, has a significantly lower armor class, and is always generated [[Invisibility|invisible]].

==Strategy==
Like [[nymph|nymphs]] in vanilla NetHack, pixies are always generated asleep. Unfortunately, this is not so useful, as it is quite easy to blunder into them if you can't see them. Once they are awake, they are a major threat, as they are quite likely to steal an item and [[teleport]] away before you can respond. Fortunately, they have only one theft attack. To fight them, you need a means to see them. The best way is to have [[see invisible]], either through the [[ring of see invisible|ring]], [[potion of see invisible|potion]], or intrinsically. Failing that, a somewhat easier option for a low-level character is to have [[telepathy]] and a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]]. Once you have a means of detecting them, they are no more threat than a usual nymph; their lack of a second seduction attack more than makes up for their slightly increased speed and better AC as compared to normal nymphs.

The '''brownie''', {{monsym|brownie}}, is a small fairy-like creature that appears in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is essentially a spellcasting counterpart to standard [[nymph (monster class)|nymphs]], and shares its glyph with the [[mountain nymph]].

==Generation==
Brownies are almost always generated asleep. One brownie is guaranteed to appear in [[Nightmare]]'s forest within the [[Lawful Quest]].

===SlashTHEM===
In SlashTHEM, one brownie is generated asleep within the village of the [[Town]] branch.

==Strategy==
Brownies are especially dangerous when awake; they are [[fast]] and possess spells such as [[Destroy armor (monster spell)|destroy armor]] and [[curse items]], on top of being able to steal items and teleport away. They also have many more hit dice than the typical nymph, although they only have one seduction attack.

While not a particularly ''damaging'' threat, they are annoying and generally not worth the risk of a cursed inventory, stolen items or even destroyed armor. It is well worth to check if that {{brown|n}} is a brownie or a mountain nymph before engaging it - if you decide not to avoid them altogether using [[stealth]] or other methods, be prepared to get rid of them quickly. Brownies can be dispatched most safely using available [[ranged weapon|ranged weapons]] and/or [[Elbereth]] - be wary that even with [[magic resistance]], allowing the brownie to get within melee range may lead to them whisking the source of your resistance off your person.

'''Quicklings''' are nymph-like monster introduced in [[SLASH'EM]]. True to their name they are extremely fast, having a [[speed]] of 30, exceeded only by the [[air elemental]]. They are also able to attack with weapons, although not for very much damage. They only appear in [[Gehennom]] and the [[Lawful Quest]].

==Strategy==
It can be something of a dizzying experience to fight a quickling, as they may move as many as 3 times before you can even get one hit in.  They do not have many hit points and only have one seduction attack, as opposed to nymphs' two. Thus they are not a huge threat, although they can be annoying when they flee after stealing an item; even if you find them they can still be very difficult to catch, even with a [[ranged weapon]]. They are best attacked when they are approaching you to attack again, preferably with a [[Multishot|good volley]] of projectiles.

Be careful not to mistake them for [[water nymph]]s, whose glyph they share. If you see a {{blue|n}} in [[Gehennom]], it is likely a quickling.

===As a polymorph form===
The intrinsic speed and relatively low level of a quickling makes them an attractive polymorph form for a starting [[Doppelganger (starting race)|doppelganger]]. They are able to carry 1000 units of weight, and unlike air elementals, can see. A doppelganger will be able to infallibly polymorph into one upon reaching experience level 3, as opposed to 8 for an air elemental. Unfortunately, they do have very few hitpoints, and they are too small to wield weapons, wear armor, or use doors. Still, they are useful forms for escaping or traveling through the Mines.

==Common traits==
All apelike creatures are defined by the <code>'''S_YETI'''</code> macro in [[monst.c]]. Apelike creatures favor clawing and biting in combat. The [[monkey]] has a theft attack, while the [[owlbear]], [[carnivorous ape]] and [[sasquatch]] have a [[grabbing attack]]. As pets, these monster regard [[banana]]s as [[treat]]s.

All apelike monsters leave [[corpse]]s which are safe to eat, subject to freshness. Furthermore, yeti corpses may grant resistance to [[cold]].

Most monsters with this ability are either those that possess significant strength or are magical in some manner.

This property treats the monster's attacks as coming from a weapon of a certain enchantment, with the exact level of enchantment governed by a set of flags describing what enchantment their attacks hit as (<tt>MR_HITASONE</tt>, <tt>MR_HITASTWO</tt> and so on). The property is also intrinsic to monsters with enchantment resistance as described above: monsters that are not given a specific <tt>MR_HITASFOO</tt> flag 'implicitly' hit as the same enchantment of weapon that they resist<ref>[[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/mhitm.c#line1002|SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2 mhitm.c, line 1002]]</ref> - e.g., the [[Aleax]] has the <tt>MR_PLUSTWO</tt> flag but no <tt>MR_HITASFOO</tt>, so Aleaxes require a +2 weapon or better to hit and hit as +2 weapons themselves.

[[You]] can gain this property by [[polymorph]]ing into such monsters, but this does not confer equivalent enchantment resistance.

Below is a list of monsters that hit as a particular enchantment of weapon - monsters with <sup>i</sup> next to their names have this property implicitly due to their enchantment resistance.

&&%s&& %s Need +x weapon to hit {142302 2021-09-03T06:30:36Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  [[SLASH'EM]] introduces two new properties derived from D&D: the ''Need +x weapon to hit'' and ''Hits monsters as a +x weapon'', where x is an integer from 1 to 4.  Essentially, monsters with the first property cannot be damaged with weapons with less than the required enchantment.  It is effectively enchantment resistance.  The second property is mainly of relevance to those who keep pets, in particular, [[pacifist|pacifists]], as an otherwise strong pet may be unable to damage a particular monster.  Note that these two properties are given to both new monsters and monsters from vanilla. It is possible to gain the ''[[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|"hits monsters as a +x weapon"]]'' property through [[polymorph]], but not the ''"needs +x weapon to hit"'' property.

==Mechanics==
What exactly the game checks for is dependent on what you are attacking with. If you can hit the monster, your weapon does normal damage. If you cannot, it does no damage, but will still count towards advancing your skill.

===Wielded weapon===
The game checks the enchantment {{refsrc|uhitm.c|769|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} of the wielded weapon.  For artifact weapons, it adds two to the enchantment check{{refsrc|uhitm.c|886|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}, and [[Magicbane]] always counts as a +4 weapon{{refsrc|uhitm.c|885|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}.  If the thus derived enchantment is greater than or equal to the monster's resistance, it can hit.  For example, a +0 artifact weapon will hit a [[statue gargoyle]] (whose enchantment resistance is +1), but not [[Vecna]] (whose enchantment resistance is +4), since it is a +0 artifact, having for the purposes of this check +2 enchantment.  As always, there are exceptions:
*A silver weapon will do normal and silver damage against a silver-hating monster
*A poisoned weapon will always be able to hit (although it may become unpoisoned as usual)
*Monsters attacking with artifact weapons get no artifact bonus; only the enchantment itself is used
An artifact which is not sufficiently enchanted to hit a monster will not cause damage from any special attacks it might have.  However, such attacks will still give their corresponding messages, leading to somewhat confusing situations such as the following:

 ''[[Serpent's Tongue|The twisted blade]] poisons the ki-rin!  The poison was deadly...''
 ''Your attack doesn't seem to harm the ki-rin.''

The ki-rin in the above situation was indeed unharmed.

===Ranged weapons===
For ranged weapons, only the enchantment of the projectile matters, not the enchantment of the launcher.  Otherwise, it works as for wielded weapons.
===Other items===
If you are wielding an item that can be enchanted or charged, whether it is [[armor]], a [[tool]], or even a [[wand]], the game still checks the enchantment/charge of that item.  The dependence on charge may seem strange, but enchantments and charges are stored by the same variable for objects ("spe"), which is the number that is checked for enchantment resistance.  This means that bashing a statue gargoyle with a wand of wishing (0:0) will do nothing, but bashing it with a wand of wishing (0:1) will hurt it.  Therefore a charged wand or tool is actually a useful backup weapon, at least for weaker monsters with enchantment resistance.  As with wielded weapons, wielded non-weapon artifacts do get a +2 bonus to this check.

===Lightsabers===

[[Lightsaber]]s can do damage to all monsters, regardless of enchantment, charges or being lit. A +0 lit lightsaber will damage [[Vecna]], but also a +0 uncharged one. Note that when unlit, damage is puny, and enchantment is ignored.

===Kicking===
If you are kicking a monster, the relevant enchantment is the enchantment of your boots.  Note that [[kicking boots]] do not help towards this, as one might expect, and that [[Whisperfeet]], the artifact [[speed boots]], do not provide a +2 bonus for this check when worn.

===Bare-handed combat===
Bare-handed attacks count as a +0 weapon irrespective of your skill, with two exceptions:
*You are polymorphed into a monster with the ''hits creatures as a +x weapon'' property, in which case you can hit if ''x'' is high enough.
*You are a [[monk]]: Monks fighting bare-handed hit creatures as a +[[XL]]/4 weapon, meaning that a level 4 monk hits as +1, level 8 as +2, level 12 as +3, and level 16 as +4.  Note that this does not apply for wielded weapons, i.e. a level 4 monk wielding a +0 weapon will not be able to hit a [[statue gargoyle]].
Note that enchanted gloves do not help, contrary to what one might expect.

===Magic attacks===
Magic attacks, from spells, scrolls, and wands, will function as normal.

==Strategy==
Finding yourself unable to attack a monster can be a deadly situation, as most of the monsters with enchantment resistance are rather dangerous.  If you find that your main weapon is insufficiently enchanted, check the other cases above to see if you might have something able to attack the monster.  If neither you nor your pet is able to damage it, then retreat and/or [[Elbereth]] are some of the only options.  Whatever you do, note that attempting to attack the monster still uses turns.  Also note that many monsters from vanilla NetHack (notably [[vampire|vampires]] and [[lich|liches]]) now have enchantment resistance.

If you are a monk, in general you will find that the effective enchantment of your attacks rises quickly enough to keep up with the resistance of monsters being generated.  However, monks should avoid descending too deep or doing the [[Chaotic Quest]] before [[XL]] 16, since they will not be able to damage [[Vecna]] or the [[Archon|Archons]] that can appear near the castle.

If you are playing a [[pacifist]] or merely using a strong pet to attack monsters, the enchantment resistance can pose a problem.  Most easily obtainable early pets lack the ability to hit monsters with enchantment resistance.  Probably the easiest route is to get a pet that can wield weapons, and give it an enchanted weapon.  Note that an artifact weapon confers no bonus to a monster merely for being an artifact weapon - it must be enchanted.  [[Magic trap|Magic traps]] in the [[Gnomish Mines]] can often leave you with some pet [[Dwarf (monster)|dwarves]] or [[Gnome (monster)|gnomes]] as pets, which can wield weapons.  Also, some baby dragons, obtainable from [[egg|eggs]], hit creatures as a +1 weapon, and are reasonably obtainable in the early game.  Those who are unable to tame a baby dragon or an intelligent monster would be well advised to save [[banana]]s: in SLASH'EM, they can be used to tame many different {{white|Y}}, including [[yeti]]s, [[sasquatch]]es, and [[zruty]], all of which hit as a +1 weapon.  In the later game, a [[bullwhip]] is quite useful for disarming your pet to enchant its weapon, a useful feature in vanilla that becomes almost crucial in SLASH'EM, as there are no tamable monsters that can naturally hit even an [[Archon]], let alone a [[Solar]].

A '''silver short sword''' is a [[weapon]] that appears in [[SLASH'EM]], [[SlashTHEM]] and [[SporkHack]]. It has roughly the same properties as an ordinary [[short sword]], but it is made of [[silver]] and thus [[erosion|erodeproof]], in addition to doing more damage against silver-hating monsters.

[[The Sword of Balance]] is an [[artifact weapon|artifact]] silver short sword found in SLASH'EM and its variants.<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/trek/mazewest/spoilers/arti_007e6.txt</ref>

==Strategy==
In [[SporkHack]], it's a useful primary weapon for [[Tourist]]s, and a solid offhand weapon for [[Valkyrie]]s, [[Knight]]s and other roles limited to Skilled in two-weapon fighting.

 |reference = [[SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2/monst.c#line2101]]
}}

Small groups of nightgaunts are commonly seen in later levels of both the [[Dungeons of Doom]] and [[Gehennom]].  They possess a unique attack, AD_TCKL,{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1416|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} which behaves exactly the same as a [[paralysis]] attack except for having a different message, and abusing constitution in addition to dexterity.

===Strategy===
The paralysis attack is no particular threat, as it is affected by [[magic cancellation]], and one is highly unlikely to encounter these monsters before having MC 3.  They are mostly a threat for being hard to kill; having a base level of 15, even with your best weapon they will take quite a few hits.  Since they are generated in groups and are quite fast, like the [[bat|bats]] with whom they share a glyph, they can be quite a nuisance.  The amount of physical damage they do is not particularly high, but from two or three of them over the period of time it will take to destroy them, can wear you down.  Note that they are capable of picking up and using [[wand|wands]] and other magic items.

Chatting with a nightgaunt will produce the message "The nightgaunt squeaks." This is likely a holdover from bats.

===Appearance===

Nightgaunts come from the works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]]. They are humanoid, thin, black, and faceless. Their skin is slick and rubbery. They have a pair of inward-facing horns on their heads, clawed hands and a long barbed tail. They can fly using a set of membranous wings. They make no sound.

Small groups of nightgaunts are found in later levels of both the [[Dungeons of Doom]] and [[Gehennom]]. They possess a unique tickling attack, with which they can strip you of your secondary weapon, your cloak, and your armor, as well as immobilizing you. In dNetHack, nightgaunts are a {{blue|g}} rather than a {{brown|B}} like SLASH'EM.

===Strategy===
The tickling attack is high dangerous. It is affected by MC, but is only partially mitigated. If the tickling attack is not resisted by your MC, you will be paralyzed for a short period and may drop your wielded weapon(s). If the tickling attack is ''blocked'' by your MC, the nightgaunt will instead attempt to remove some of your equipment, or failing that paralyze you. Note that free action will prevent the paralysis but will not affect the removal of any armor.
*If you are wearing a cloak, they will attempt to remove it and drop it in your square. 
*If you aren't wearing a cloak, but have an alternate weapon readied, they will remove it from your inventory and drop it in your square. 
*If you aren't wearing a cloak and don't have an alternate weapon readied, they will attempt to remove any body armor you are wearing and drop it in your square.
*If you aren't wearing any body armor, you will be paralyzed for a short amount of time unless you have free action. This can happen even if you are wielding weapons, and has an additional chance to make you drop your weapons. You have a 2/3 chance of being paralyzed for one turn, and a 1/3 chance of being paralyzed for d10 turns.

Only one piece of equipment can be removed per attack.

They are somewhat hard to kill; having a base level of 15, even with your best weapon they may take quite a few hits. Since they are generated in groups and are quite fast, they can be a serious threat. They are vulnerable to death rays and are a valid genocide target. They can also be [[Ward (dNetHack)|warded]] off by the Elder Sign, Elbereth (elves only), or a Heptagram.

A '''poisonous cloak''' is a cloak unique to [[SLASH'EM]].  It is dangerous, as it can [[poison]] you, possibly fatally.  The cloak has a randomized appearance, the ''dirty rag'' being the new random appearance added to accommodate it.
==Mechanics==
When worn, if you lack [[poison resistance]], the cloak delivers a [[poisoned]] attack with a 1 in 3{{refsrc|do_wear.c|233|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} chance of being fatal, otherwise doing normal strength/hp damage and identifying the cloak.  If you have poison resistance, the cloak has no effect, but gives the message "This cloak feels a little itchy."{{refsrc|do_wear.c|228|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}  Although this unambiguously identifies the cloak, it does not actually self-identify in this case.  The cloak does not cause any sort of continuing damage, but only hurts you when you [[wear]] it with the [[W]] command.

==Dangers and uses==
As the attack has quite a high chance of being fatal, it is obviously undesirable to put these cloaks on before getting poison resistance.  It can be difficult to identify them, though, since they are '''not''' normally generated cursed, thus, an altar provides no help in avoiding them.  [[Price identification]] is a useful way to identify them, as no other cloaks have a base cost of 40.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof, as poisonous cloaks, unlike other [[fumble boots|harmful]] [[levitation boots|pieces]] of [[Gauntlets of fumbling|armor]], are reasonably likely to be generated with a +1 enchantment, giving them the same cost as a [[cloak of protection]] or a [[cloak of displacement]].  The only surefire ways to identify these cloaks are to formally identify all randomized cloaks you intend to put on, or to [[cancel]] every cloak you intend to price-ID, or to use a monster with the [[need +x weapon to hit]] property to determine their enchantment.

However, should you put on a poisonous cloak and survive the attack, you should probably not immediately take it off.  Although it provides no base AC, it does provide [[Magic cancellation|MC 3]], a property ironically useful against, among other things, monsters' poisoned attacks.  It will not poison you further, unless you take it off and put it on again, and so is harmless to leave in place.  Thus, it is best to leave it on until you come across a better cloak or wish to replace your body armor (although be sure not to put the cloak back on if you still lack poison resistance!).  If you do have poison resistance, these cloaks are a good source of MC 3 if you can find no others, which happens occasionally.

It slows down the turn counter for rnd(TECHLEVEL+1)+2 time. The technique can be used again after 500-1499 turns.

While the technique is in use, you have an effective speed of 24 if you have normal speed, 28 if you are fast, or 30 if you are very fast.

{{message|You sense the flow of time returning to normal|The technique has expired. The turn counter has returned to normal.}}

In the early game, the Blink technique only lasts for a couple of game turns. Because of this, you should only use it when you are close to a monster that you may have trouble with. You can also use it to throw more daggers or cast more spells before the monster can reach you.

Its main goals are:
# Fix game balance issues.
# Eliminate tedious and frustrating parts of the game.
# Make uninteresting things more diverse, unique, and varied.
# Experiment with new ideas from the community.

It is not intended to be a "kitchen-sink variant"&mdash;the main focus is on enhancing and deepening the existing systems in the game, rather than adding lots of new objects, monsters, and roles willy-nilly.

It is intended to keep up with the development version of vanilla NetHack, and will regularly merge in its latest commits. It has also drawn inspiration from [[SpliceHack]], [[EvilHack]], [[NetHack Fourk]], [[GruntHack]], SliceHack, and various patches from the 3.4.3 era.

Version 7.0 of xNetHack is currently released and is available to play on the [[hardfought]] public servers.

xNetHack's source can be found [https://github.com/copperwater/xNetHack on Github], should you want to compile it yourself.

SpliceHack aims to be a kitchen sink variant that maintains similar balance to vanilla and offers a large selection of quality of life features.

The main goals of SpliceHack are as follows:
* Add many new monsters, items, and other features in order to make the game more dynamic and interesting.
* Maintain a healthy balance that is challenging, but still fun to play.
* Create a more interesting endgame and ascension.
* Make changes intuitive enough that a player used to playing vanilla NetHack can learn to play SpliceHack with little difficulty.
* Pull in changes from vanilla NetHack if they are compatible.

Conducts only apply to actions in game; a priest "should" believe in a god but does not automatically lose atheist conduct, and classes that begin the game with learned [[spell]]s can play illiterate.

It features virtual trophies for achievements and user and clan competitions.

Junethack differs from other tournaments like the [[:/dev/null/nethack_tournament|/dev/null nethack tournament]] in that the users play on participating [[public server]]s instead of dedicated tournament servers.

The game will store no more than one bones file per dungeon level. When a player enters a level for the first time and a bones file exists for that level, it will only be loaded as a bones level 1/3 of the time; otherwise it will generate the usual level and the bones file will remain untouched. 

If a second adventurer is killed in a bones level, the level may then again be saved as bones, creating a '''double bones''', or rarely even a triple or quadruple bones.

Bones levels can be very beneficial to find, since they will contain a '''bones pile''' where the dead adventurer has dropped all their possessions, but they can also be dangerous, since whatever killed the adventurer is likely still lurking around somewhere.

Across variants, each time you attempt to attack a displacer beast in melee, you have around a 50% chance of merely displacing it like a [[pet]]. Using {{kbd|F}} to force an attack will not move you or the displacer beast, and results in attacking "thin air" if you would have displaced it.

Displacer beasts can pose a real problem in combat - in addition to their intrinsic displacement rendering around half your melee attacks harmless, they also have a very low AC and high HP, and can do quite a bit of damage. Luckily, they are not fast, and a player with [[speed]] should be able to outrun them. This is particularly advisable if there are other hostile monsters around, since missed attacks leave you open to retaliation from them and the displacer beast itself.

Amusingly, you can displace a displacer beast into water or lava, killing it instantly.

In xNetHack, displacer beasts are eligible to be summoned with the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]]. Eating displacer beast meat confers intrinsic [[displacement]] for 6d6 turns.

<!--==Variants== <- in preparation for 3.7.0's eventual release-->

The displacer beast is a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', monster that projects a displaced image a few feet from where it actually stands. It is the source mythology for the displacement provided by the [[cloak of displacement]].

'''Lightning''' is a [[Monster_spell#Clerical_Spells|clerical spell]] that monsters of level 12 or higher can cast at you.  It deals 8d6 [[shock]] damage, which can be reduced by [[half spell damage]], or prevented completely by [[shock resistance]] or [[reflection]].

:Your source of [[reflection]] protected you (and your equipment) from the Lightning spell.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and some variants based on it like [[SLASH'EM]], this spell does not cause blindness.  Given that most other attacks described as "[[lightning]]" have a blinding flash, this was considered unusual and marked as a [[bug]] ([[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3|C342-46]]).
