* No SLASH'EM roles can start with magic markers anymore (from Evil).

==== Convict ==== 

Convicts present a unique challenge from the standard vanilla roles. Their alignment is always chaotic, regardless of racial background. They start out with some critical disadvantages that the player will have to quickly and creatively overcome to survive. 

Convicts start out with negative alignment and punished with a [[heavy iron ball]] chained to their leg, and they also start wearing a cursed fireproof striped shirt. The shirt prevents entry into any shop while worn and visible (not covered by a cloak or robe). The shirt is fireproof so one can't simply dip it in a forge to dispose of it. They get no other weapons or armor at the start of the game, and to top it off convicts start on the verge of hunger. However, one of the convict's strengths is that they  burn nutrition at half the normal rate while hungry or worse. Be careful before rushing to Minetown because the watchguards are on the lookout for you! If they see your face, they will be angered and pursue you. Wear a blindfold or towel as a quick disguise! Keep in mind that if a shopkeeper sees you with the striped shirt on - they will ban you for life (services will also not be available), so make sure to cover it up before getting close to a shop. Another challenge is that Convicts cannot tame domestic pets as normal - they will always be "wary" of you.

* Their first artifact gift is [[Luck Blade]], a chaotic broadsword (short sword in other variants) that acts as a [[luckstone]].
* Their starting pet is a sewer rat, and convicts can tame other rats by #chatting them.

Changes from Convict Patch:

* Replaced convict's quest artifact, [[The Iron Ball of Liberation]], with [[The Iron Spoon of Liberation]].
* Added secret doors to some of the prison cells on the quest home level, so it's easier for players to navigate.
* Convicts start with a spoon, which uses knife skill. Convicts also get [[backstab]] bonuses (similar to Rogues) when wielding a spoon.
* Convicts can reach expert in firearms.


==== Infidel ====

The Infidel role was created by [[User:Tomsod]] (see [https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/User:Tomsod/YANIs_and_patches/Infidel this link] for the original patch and author notes). It has been ported from EvilHack and subsequently to Hack'EM with minimal changes.

If you are looking for something completely different (and evil) - look no further than the Infidel!  Infidels don't follow any of the typical alignments, they are worshipers of [[Moloch]] and therefore unaligned.

Forget searching for the Amulet of Yendor because you actually start with it! Your primary mission is to travel down to the [[Sanctum]], find the unaligned altar, and sacrifice the Amulet in honor of Moloch. When doing this, you must have your quest artifact in open inventory (the [[User:Tomsod/YANIs_and_patches/Infidel#Quest_artifact|Idol of Moloch]]). Moloch may then imbue the Idol with the power of the Amulet. 

Your secondary mission is to travel back up through the dungeon and make your way to the [[Astral Plane]], where you will attempt to invoke the Idol on the correct altar (to Moloch), thereby giving Moloch dominion over 'heaven' and the other three aligned gods, thus winning you the game.

Like a standard game with the Amulet of Yendor - the correct altar that an Infidel needs to invoke the [[User:Tomsod/YANIs_and_patches/Infidel#Quest_artifact|Idol of Moloch]] on in the Astral Plane will vary each game. They can discover which is the correct altar by #chatting both their [[quest leader]] and the [[High priest of Moloch]] in the [[Sanctum]]. 

{|class="prettytable"
!Level 1:

|-
!Level 15:

|-

'''Inventory:'''

* a [[spellbook of drain life]] plus one other random spellbook.
* Infidels starting armor is cursed - they actually benefit from wearing cursed armor and wielding cursed weapons, and are able to remove/unwield these items without penalty. 
* Wearing blessed armor slightly hurts spellcasting success rates.
* a [[cloak of protection]] (cursed)
* 2 [[scrolls of charging]]
* a [[fire horn]]
* 3 potions of unholy water
* an [[oilskin sack]]

* Their starting pet is a [[lesser homunculus]].

'''Perks'''

* Their first artifact gift is [[User:Tomsod/YANIs_and_patches/Infidel#First_gift|Secespita]], a copper ritual knife that greatly aids with altar sacrificing, and can drain energy from the monsters it was used to kill, helping to replenish spell power for the Infidel.
* The [[User:Tomsod/YANIs_and_patches/Infidel#Quest_artifact|Idol of Moloch]] is the Infidel's quest artifact, a figurine of a horned devil that can be used to easily convert altars to Moloch, and provides magic resistance when carried. It can also be used to summon demons to aid the Infidel. An Infidel cannot win the game without having the Idol in their possession.
* Crowning - if an Infidel is crowned by Moloch, they transform into a demon, replete with a stinger-tipped tail and large wings, both of which can be used. In demon form, the Infidel can enjoy all of the strengths (and weaknesses) associated with being a demon. Trident skill is unlocked and can be trained all the way up to expert skill. Their crowning gift is a spellbook of fireball.

'''Gameplay'''

* Infidels are considered primary spellcasters.
* Infidels are either not penalized or will gain alignment for doing things that would normally be detrimental for other roles, such as murdering peacefuls or sacrificing their pets (killing your pet is still viewed as bad).
* Infidels praying to Moloch ''outside of [[Gehennom]]'' can expect an 80% failure rate. The only reliable means of praying are standing on an unaligned altar or being in Gehennom. Converting an aligned altar to Moloch is also much more difficult without aid - Moloch's power and influence are weakened outside of hell.
* '''Moloch expects an Infidel to perform a sacrifice to him at least once every 6000 turns.''' Not doing so adversely affects your [[alignment record]], and it will begin to drain at an increasing rate; reaching negative values has a chance of incrementing Moloch's anger as well. Successfully performing a sacrifice delays this effect for 500 turns per point of sacrifice value; this delay is not cumulative, and if the previous remaining delay was higher, it isn't affected. Any sacrifice to Moloch counts, including same-race sacrifice and a sacrifice on a cross-aligned altar (as long as you're actually trying to convert the altar and not yourself). You will be warned when you're due for a sacrifice, both through a message and in the base attributes window.
* Infidels create unholy water the same way other roles would create holy water, by placing potions of water on a co-aligned altar and praying (Moloch's 'blessings' are actually curses). This can present a unique challenge for the Infidel role, as having certain blessed items is still desirable. They will need to find already blessed potions of water much the same way other roles typically have to find an already cursed potion of water to use.
* The Amulet suppresses teleportation and drains spell power when casting spells as it always has - this can prove quite challenging, especially in the early game. If you cast without the Amulet in your inventory, the spell will drain hit points instead of power. {{spell of|Healing}} and {{spell of|extra healing}} drain extra health so that using them is never a net gain. Hit point regeneration is also suppressed without having the Amulet in inventory. Once the Idol is imbued with the power of the Amulet, Moloch gains control over its power and suppresses the spell power draining and non-hit point regeneration effects (teleportation is still suppressed while holding the Idol).
* All aligned priests are hostile towards Infidels and will attack them should they enter their temple.

==== Flame Mage ==== 

The Flame Mage first made it's appearance in SLASH'EM - where it was mostly a pseudo-copy of the wizard role but with fire items and spells. In Hack'EM, we have aimed to add more depth to this role and explore the power of their element. Because fire can be viewed as a symbol of divinity and wisdom, Flame mages cast magic (and get spellcasting bonuses) using wisdom and can reach expert in the magic of divination. Their special spell has also been changed to Enlighten, functioning as a play on "light" magic and a result of wisdom. (The reason it is not fireball is that the Infidel has fireball as their special spell, and the flame mage starts with a spellbook of fireball).

{|class="prettytable"
!Level 1: 
|Extrinsic fire resistance (inventory is protected from fire damage)
|-
!Level 5:
|Becomes vulnerable to cold
|}
* Flame Mage can only be Lawful or Neutral.
* Flame Mages no longer gain cold resistance at level 13. (Their quest artifact also does NOT grant cold resistance anymore)
* Flame Mages also "like fire", so fire usually doesn't have an adverse affect on them.

'''Inventory:'''
* Starts with a more fire based inventory: 
** potions of oil
** fire bombs
** scrolls of fire
** fireproof quarterstaff
** fireproof robe
* Starts with Fire Bolt instead of Flame Sphere (Fire Bolt is a Flame Mage exclusive spell).

* Gets spell-hunger reduction (similar to wizards but a little weaker).
* Flame mages cannot twoweapon and have a multishot penalty.
* Their skill set has been rebalanced more in favor of blunt weapons (staff, club, etc).
* Fire Elementals generate peaceful for Flame Mages
* They can reach skilled in firearms.

* One major drawback to Flame Mages is that they can never attain 100% cold resistance. When they get Vulnerability to Cold at level 5 their max cold resistance caps at 50%.

* Flame mages cannot use anything that is decidedly the domain of cold magic:
** No wielding Frost Brand/Deep Freeze.
** No reading cold based spellbooks (cone of cold, freeze sphere)
** Should not receive cold based spellbooks or weapons from their god either.

'''#youpoly'''
* At level 8, the Flame Mage gains access to their baby red dragon form via the #youpoly command. Transforming costs 20 MP.
* At level 15, you can #youpoly into an adult red dragon form. Transforming costs 40 MP.
* The transformation process takes 2 turns.
* You get a discount for wearing red dragon scales or scaled armor.

==== Ice Mage ====

Ice Mages are the masters of cold magic. Like Flame Mages, they also appeared in SLASH'EM. In Hack'EM, they embody the dangerous but strong nature of ice. Their skills have been adjusted to represent mostly piercing weapons (knives, daggers, etc), and they have a few more tricks then they did in SLASH'EM. 

* Can only be Chaotic or Neutral

* Ice Mages no longer gain fire resistance at level 13. (Their quest artifact also does NOT grant fire resistance anymore)

* '''Intrinsic ice armor AC protection'''
** When you gain levels, your protection (ice armor) will grow more powerful.
** Calculation is: ''ACBONUS = -((YOURLEVEL / 2) + 2)''
** Like SLASH'EM, this bonus caps at -11
** Ice mages also get a passive ice attack that scales with their ice armor strength and level. The chance of triggering this passive improves as you gain levels. Ice mages don't get a passive ice armor attack until level 4.

* Removed studded armor, replaced with robe
* Removed starting potions (they might freeze from the cold)
* Starts with a [[frost horn]] in addition to a [[wand of cold]]
* Start with a stack of [[snowballs]] (random quantity).

* Gets spell-hunger reduction (similar to wizards but a little weaker).
* Can now reach skilled in two-weapon and expert in riding.
* Ice mages get the multishot penalty, but it does not apply to knives.
* Their special spell is [[spell of reflection]].
* Ice Elementals generate peaceful for Ice Mages.

'''#youpoly'''
* At level 8, the Ice Mage gains access to their baby white dragon form via the #youpoly command. Transforming costs 20 MP.
* At level 15, you can #youpoly into an adult white dragon form. Transforming costs 40 MP.
* The transformation process takes 2 turns.
* You get a discount for wearing white dragon scales or scaled armor.

One major drawback to playing Ice Mages is that they can never attain 100% fire resistance. When they get Vulnerability to Fire at level 5 their max fire resistance caps at 50%.

* Ice mages cannot use anything that is decidedly the domain of fire magic:
** No wielding Fire Brand/Firewall.
** No reading fire based spellbooks (fireball, flame sphere)
** Should not receive fire based spellbooks or weapons from their god either.

==== Necromancer ====

'''Inventory:'''
* Removed starting quarterstaff, starts with 2 daggers instead. They still start with a +1 pick-axe.
* Starts with a robe and wand of fear.
* Removed starting scrolls; only starts with 1 ring.

'''Gameplay:'''
* Enabled necromancer to reach expert in polearms (for access to [[scythe]]s like [[The End]]).
* Necromancers now receive a +1 alignment bonus when digging graves, and will exercise wisdom if they find a corpse.
* The necromancer's starting [[ghoul]] has the ghoulname option available.
* Their special spell is summon undead.
* Undead will never betray Necromancers (lots of undead are treacherous in Hack'EM, so charm monster isn't as reliable as it used to be.)
* Like convicts, Necromancers now cannot tame anything other than undead. Instead of taming, the best result that occurs will be pacifying the target. 

With inspiration from aosdict, the Necromancer role has been overhauled with a new approach.

'''Spirits'''

* When playing as a necromancer, monsters that die drop "spirits". These are auto-collected as you walk over or adjacent to them.
* Spirits show up as a light-blue '~' symbol.
* Spirits in shops will not be auto-collected since it will be in the possession of the shopkeeper.
* Nonliving monsters do not leave spirits.
* Spirits cannot be picked up by you or other monsters, they will disappear as soon as anything tries to pick them up. If wished for, they will be absorbed immediately into your being.
* Spirits will fade away quickly, so don't let them sit around. On graveyard levels, they have a much higher timeout.
* Very rarely, spirits will sometimes turn into will-o'-the-wisps when they fade. On swamp levels this is much more common. 
* Spirits generate when graves are dug up.
* Spirits generate in morgues (on the corpses of dead players).
* Multi-headed monsters drop more spirits (hydras, ettins, two-headed trolls).
* Some classes and specific monsters will also want your spirits so try to collect them before they do!
** All L, W, A, & will consume spirits.
** Valkyries, Necromancers, shades, specters, weredemons, aloons also will try to get your spirits.
** ''Tame undead will not try to eat your spirits.''

'''Spirits heal HP:'''

'''Spirits renew magical power:'''
* Necromancers do not regenerate magical power as other roles do. 
* To renew your MP, you will have to collect spirits or find some other means (potions of gain energy, scrolls of charging, etc).
* A new necromancer starts with 0 energy, but a max of 99, so you can stock up.

==== Undead Slayer ====

Remember Simon from the Castlevania games, or Buffy the Vampire Slayer? This role takes cues from both of those characters and more. Are you sick of the Evil zombie constantly eating your brains and dying from illness?  Well, now is your turn to kick some zombie butt. The Undead Slayer is your answer to zombies, vampires, and all sorts of things that crawl in the night. Originally from SLASH'EM, we have retooled the Slayer a bit for the challenges in Hack'EM. Starting out slow is no longer an option, so that has been discarded. They have more strength in actually slaying undead and their skills and intrinsics have been rounded out. Warning and Clairvoyance kick in at higher levels, and when speed is gained at level 7 it means more than overcoming the old slowness.

* Crossbow bolts and bullets will be silver.
* If playing as a tortle slayer, your trident will also be silver.

'''Gameplay:'''
* Can now #turn undead
* Immune to fear attacks from undead or ghosts.
* Slayers get an alignment penalty for eating wraith corpses.
* Undead slayers get +2 to-hit bonus against undead/demons and inflict +d4 damage (like hitting as a blessed weapon (this also stacks with the blessed weapon bonus.)
* Undead slayers obliterate zombies to the point that they don't leave corpses. 2 in 3 chance of this happening every time you kill a zombie.
* Their special spell is protection
* Their first sacrifice gift is the [[Holy Spear of Light]].
*
* Undead slayers do NOT have a multishot penalty.
* Instead of being able to attain Grand Master in Bare Handed combat, they can now get Master in Martial Arts.

* Undead Slayers can reach basic in two-weaponing.

==== Yeoman ====

The Yeoman is another role from SLASH'EM that we have retooled a bit. In SLASH'EM the Yeoman closely resembled the Knight, maybe too closely. We have given them a few more tools and a dashing green coat to get them started. Like the Undead Slayer, they also had their starting slowness removed. Other races like tortle and giant have slowness, so that trait isn't totally lost with this change.

==== Pirate ====

Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! If it's a pirate's life ye want, then it's the pirate role for ye! This role offers a fun immersive experience into the pirate role where most of the game messages will be translated into pirate speak for you. You'll also start with a pet [[monkey]] or [[parrot]], and what pirate would leave home without a few bottles of rum?

This role offers a few twists on the standard NetHack experience. Most notably, the pirate can only gain one gift from altar sacrifice gifts - the [[Marauder's Map]] - after that, they will receive no further gifts from their god. After that, you have to rely on randomly generated artifacts. Luckily, pirates have improved odds: artifacts generate four times as often as for other roles when you're a Pirate! Although they can't get weapons from sacrifice gifts, they do get an artifact cutlass from being crowned - the [[Reaver]], which will handily steal items from enemies when it hits them. Finally, their quest artifact is the [[Treasury of Proteus]] - a powerful chest that has mysterious powers. Once you have possession of the chest, you are considered "King of the Hill", and will attract the attention of pirates far and wide, dead and alive.

==== Jedi ====

The Jedi role has been ported from SlashTHEM. The Jedi have a delicate relationship with their lightsabers - the lightsabers provide offense, defense, and utility, but they demand attention and maintenance. As a master of the force, you will have to balance your use of the lightsaber to make sure you don't exhaust its charges when you need it most. The Jedi skill set is narrowly focused on swords and sabers, so you will have to make the most of your lightsaber and use your techniques to get out of tight spots.


'''Inventory:'''
* +1 robe,
* +0 leather gloves,
* Chance of either a red, green or blue lightsaber,
* 50% chance of a blindfold.


'''Gameplay:'''
* Jedi can reach skilled in enchantment spells.

* Jedi can reach basic in firearms.
