If the first guess here yields two turning gears, you know the B must be in the first position. Repeat this process for C, but with the known A and B in place:

 BCDAD
 BDCAD
 BDDAC

If the third guess here yields three turning gears, you know the C must be in the third position.

Because G is present twice, you know that the remaining two unknown letters must both be G, and so the passtune is BGGAC.

This method uses at most 16 guesses.

==The slightly clever solution==

The idea here is the same as above, but you make guesses as you discover information, as shown in the example below:

First guess AAAAA. If no gears turn, try BBBBB, then CCCCC, and you will find a letter which is present in the solution, say, A.

Now guess that A is in the first position, and try to discover whether the solution contains B:

 ABBBB

If two tumblers click, the first position must be B, so next guess that A is in the second position and that there are C's:

 BACCC

If two tumblers click and one gear turns, the second position must be C, so next guess that A is in the third position and that there are D's:

 BCADD

If one tumbler clicks and two gears turn, you know the A can't be in the third position and that there are no D's, so try:

 BCEAE

If one tumbler clicks and two gears turn, you know the A can't be in the fourth position and that there are no E's, so try:

 BCFFA

If three gears turn, you know there are no F's, so the solution must be:

 BCGGA

This method is faster than the intuitive one, but requires some thought.

==The best solution==

A number of schemes for solving general mastermind games are known, such as [http://web.archive.org/web/20030218014634/http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/degrees/undergrad/Reports/rtrosu/heuristic.htm this one], which requires random guesses, but on average only a small number of them.

&&%s&& %s Studded leather armor {149822 2023-01-30T12:16:43Z {4001618 Tmkrth} /* Origin */ capital letter at beginning of sentence {{armor

'''Studded leather armor''' is a type of [[body armor]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It weighs 200 [[aum]] and is made of [[leather]].

==Generation==
Armor comprises 10% of all randomly-generated items in the [[Dungeons of Doom|main dungeon]], 12% on the [[Rogue level]], and 20% in [[Gehennom]]. There is a 72/1000 chance that a randomly spawned armor object will be studded leather armor.<ref>http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/armr-343.html</ref>

[[Mercenaries]], including that make up the [[Watch]] and the [[Yendorian army]], [[Monster starting inventory|may be generated with]] studded leather armor, depending on that mercenary's target AC.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|628|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Description==
Studded leather armor provides 3 points of AC and [[magic cancellation|MC1]] when worn.

==Strategy==
Studded leather does not inhibit [[spellcasting]], making it a common body armor choice for early [[Wizard]]s and players focused on combat spellcasting; for other players, studded leather is usually a somewhat lighter substitute for heavier starting armor in order to reduce inventory weight. In either case, this armor is usually and eventually replaced with a [[mithril-coat]] or [[dragon scale mail]]; [[crystal plate mail]] does not inhibit spellcasting, but it has more than twice the weight of studded leather.

==History==
Studded leather armor first appears in [[Hack for PDP-11]], a variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]]. Before this, studded leather was one of the stock armor types in the original ''[[Rogue (game)|Rogue]]'', where it provided two points of AC reduction as it does in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Brigandine}}
[[File:Brigfront.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Reconstruction of 15th century brigandine armor]]
The studded leather of ''NetHack'' is borrowed from the first edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where it was described as "leather armor to which have been fastened metal studding as additional protection, usually including an outer coat of fairly close-set studs";<ref>AD&D1 Dungeon Masters Guide, Page 27</ref> this description may be derived from medieval artworks and reconstructions of brigandine armor. With highly visible rivets on the outside layer of leather, these rivets held many small metal plates beneath the leather exterior to allow greater maneuverability than full plate armor, and greater protection than armor made entirely of leather.

Real-world studded leather armor uses the studs to provide structural support, rather than serving a defensive purpose; they were used to fasten small metal plates beneath the leather exterior or hold the layers of leather together. Very rarely they are included as decoration, as this typically hampers the armor's functionality.
{{clear}}

==Variants==
In variants with [[object materials]] systems, the armor is referred to as simply '''studded armor''', with the name of the material appended in front (e.g., "a leather studded armor").

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], [[Knight]]s get a weight reduction for any body armor heavier than studded leather armor.

The rating it might attain depends on the quality of your imagination: on the surface, it has no graphic violence (indeed no graphic anything), but gameplay generally involves slaughter on a massive scale, murder, [[theft]], [[genocide]], [[demon]] sex, hallucinogenic drug use and [[Altar|occult rituals]].

'''Moats''', '''pools''' and '''swamps''', {{blue|<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}, are bodies of deep water.

[[You]] cannot swim in your natural form. Entering a water [[square]] without any precautions will cause you to fall in ("You sink like a rock!"). If there is a floor tile next to the water (with no monster on it), you will try to climb out safely;{{refsrc|trap.c|2902}} otherwise you can [[drown]]. If your [[encumbrance]] status is at least stressed (or burdened, if you are [[punished]]), you will automatically drop some of your gear into the water to lose enough weight to be able to climb out and avoid drowning.{{refsrc|trap.c|2930}} However, you might not be able to drop worn armor or a cursed [[loadstone]] in time to avoid drowning.{{refsrc|trap.c|2772}} Even if you make it out, you risk [[wet|water damage to your items]].

Water can be found at [[Fort Ludios]], the [[Castle]], the [[Wizard of Yendor]]'s room, [[Juiblex's swamp]] and [[Medusa's Island|Medusa's level]], and after digging down on a [[fountain]], among other places; see [[#where it is|below]] for a complete list.

Many [[sea monster]]s live in water areas. They will try to grab you and drown you. To avoid this, you should detect and evade the relatively slow eels, or wear a non-cursed [[oilskin cloak]] or [[grease]]d armor. If you can detect the sea monsters from afar, you may kill them with some [[spell]]s, [[missile]]s or [[polearm]]s. In case this is not an option, you should always have some [[escape item]]s in your inventory.

==Destroying water==
===Boil it away===

Water can be evaporated with a [[wand of fire]], [[fire horn]], [[potion of oil]], or [[fireball|the fireball spell]]. You can also [[polyself]] into or exploit nearby [[red dragon]]s and [[red naga]]s whose breath attacks can evaporate water. Only water in pools can be evaporated; see {{sa|Pool vs. moat vs. water|sectionsign=1}} below.

{{message|Some water evaporates.|Something evaporated a water tile.}}

===Freeze it solid===

Water can be frozen into [[ice]] with a [[wand of cold]], [[frost horn]], or [[cone of cold|the cone of cold spell]]. You can also [[polyself]] into or exploit nearby [[silver dragon|silver]] and [[white dragon]]s and [[winter wolf|winter wolves]] whose breath attacks can freeze water. Beware of [[red naga]]s and [[red dragon]]s which can melt the ice, and note that ice may melt over time.

The [[Amulet of Yendor]] and [[invocation items]] will appear on top of the newly-created [[ice]]. For other items, dig a pit in the resulting [[ice]] to retrieve the objects. Beware the pit filling back up from adjoining non-frozen water&mdash;see {{sa|Pool vs. moat vs. water|sectionsign=1}} below.

{{message|The water freezes.|Something froze a water tile.}}

===Fill it in===

Use a boulder to fill up the tile, making it [[floor|solid ground]]. This has a 90% chance of success, and always consumes the boulder.

Just as when the water freezes, the amulet and invocation items float, while others will need to be dug out.

{{message|You push the boulder into the water.|You pushed a boulder onto a water tile.}}
{{message|Now you can cross it!|The water tile was filled in.}}
{{message|It sinks without a trace!|The water tile was not filled in. This happens 10% of the time.}}
{{message|There is a large splash as the boulder fills the water.|A boulder generated by [[scroll of earth]] or thrown landed directly on a water tile and filled it in.}}
{{message|There is a large splash as the boulder falls into the water. It sinks without a trace!|As above, but the boulder failed to fill in the water tile.}}

==Getting across water==
Water squares can be passed in several ways. These include (roughly in order of usefulness and desirability):

* [[levitation|Levitate]] over the water.
* Wear [[water walking boots]] and walk over them.
* [[Jumping|Jump]] over the water. There need to be closely spaced islands for this method to work (this is the case, for example, on [[Medusa's Island]]).
* [[Teleport]] to the other side of the water. This is only occasionally helpful, as most bodies of water are on [[no-teleport level]]s.
* Fill in the water using [[boulder]]s, perhaps from a [[scroll of earth]].
* Freeze the water using a [[wand of cold]], the [[cone of cold]] spell, or some other means such as a breath attack. Be aware that fire can melt the ice and drown you if you're walking on it.
* Evaporate the water with a [[wand of fire]], the [[fireball]] spell, or some other means such as a breath attack. This only works with pools (see {{sa|Pool vs. moat vs. water|sectionsign=1}} below).
* Wear an [[amulet of magical breathing]] and walk through the water (your objects will become [[wet]]).
*[[Saddle]] and [[ride]] a [[flying]] or [[levitating]] [[pet]]. (There are no rideable [[amphibious]] or floating monsters. A rideable [[breathless]] monster would just drown you, if one existed.)
* [[Polymorph]] into a [[flying]], [[levitating]], [[floating]], [[amphibious]], or [[breathless]] monster.
* Get [[Punishment|punished]], pick up your [[iron ball]], and throw it over the water, having the ball pull you along. Be careful where the ball lands&mdash;if it lands in the water, it will pull you down and drown you!
* Step into the water and hope to climb back up on the correct side (your objects will become [[wet]]). You can repeat this process as many times as necessary, but you can only cross a one-tile-wide water barrier this way. (This works for the [[Castle]]'s moat if you have no other means of getting across.)

==Retrieving items==

Items that have fallen into a pool or moat do not disappear; rather they remain at the bottom. They can be retrieved in one of several ways:

*Zap a [[wand of teleportation]] or [[Spellbook of teleport away|spell of teleport away]] at the pool or moat and find the teleported items. (This works all right on levels that are mostly land, but is generally a bad idea on watery levels, as the item will likely end up in the water someplace else and be difficult to find again.)
*Wear an [[amulet of magical breathing]].
*Polymorph into a [[M1_amphibious|amphibious]] or [[breathless]] monster. [[Flying]], [[levitating]], and [[floating]] monsters cannot pick up underwater items. This includes monsters that are also [[breathless]] (wraiths).{{refsrc|hack.c|1858}}
*Successfully apply a [[bullwhip]] downward while [[flying]] or [[levitating]] over the square.
*Freeze the water, then dig out the item.
*Fill in the water, then dig out the item.
*Evaporate the water.

If you use any other method to get above the water and try to pick things up, you will fail. ("You cannot dive into the water to pick things up", or "You can't even see the bottom, let alone pick up something" if [[breathless]] and [[flying]]/[[levitating]]/[[floating]].) This is a generic message and does not reveal if the square actually contains items to retrieve.

==Pool vs. moat vs. water==

According to the source code, there are three types of watery terrain; "WATER" terrain is found only on the [[Plane of Water]], and cannot be altered directly by the player. All other watery terrain is either "POOL" or "MOAT".

Note that NetHack does not necessarily report "MOAT" as "moat"; it may be described as "swamp" ([[Juiblex's Swamp]]), "water" ([[Medusa's Island]]) or "moat" (any other level).{{refsrc|mkmaze.c|1147}}

In most respects, the terrain types "POOL" and "MOAT" behave identically. They cannot be distinguished easily by the player. However, moats are considered to have considerably more water in them than pools. Their behavior differs in the following respects:

* Pools can be evaporated with [[ray]]s or [[explosion]]s of [[fire]]; moats cannot.{{refsrc|zap.c|3576}}
* You need three adjacent pools to have a chance of having a [[pit]] you [[dig]] filled with water. You only require a single adjacent moat square.{{refsrc|dig.c|443}}
* Pools have a {{frac|10}} chance of containing a [[kelp frond]], while moat squares have a {{frac|30}} chance of containing one.{{refsrc|mklev.c|850}}
* Moat squares are considered contiguous with adjacent moat squares for the purposes of [[punished|dragging a heavy iron ball]]; pools are not.{{refsrc|ball.c|564}}
* When you die from [[drowning]], moats are reported as "moat" unless you are on the Medusa's Island level. Otherwise, you drowned in a "pool of water". This means that the MOAT terrain of Juiblex's swamp counts as a "moat" for this death message.{{refsrc|mhitu.c|1233}}{{refsrc|trap.c|2947}}
* Water under a [[drawbridge]] is always a moat.{{refsrc|dbridge.c|171}}
* In [[wizard mode]], you can only wish for pools, not moats (or water).

The easiest way to distinguish the type of water you are dealing with is by {{va|where it is}}:

* Overflowing [[fountain]]s produce pools.{{refsrc|fountain.c|104}}
* The [[swamp]] special room contains pools.{{refsrc|mkroom.c|446}}
* The water created during the [[invocation ritual]] is moat.{{refsrc|mklev.c|1467}}
* The following special levels contain only moats at the start (any water produced from a fountain will still be pools):
** [[Fort Ludios]]
** [[Medusa's Island]]
** The [[Castle]]
** Both [[Fake Wizard's Tower|fake]] and [[Wizard's Tower|genuine]] Wizard's Towers.
** [[Archeologist quest]]
** [[Rogue quest]]
** [[Tourist quest]]
** [[Wizard quest]]
* The following special levels contain only pools:
** [[Barbarian quest]]
** [[Healer quest]]
** [[Knight quest]]
* The following special levels contain pools and moats:
** The [[Valkyrie quest]]; water that starts as liquid, around [[lava]] pools, is pool. Water that starts frozen is frozen moat.
** [[Juiblex's Swamp]]; almost all the water is moat. There are six pools, four in a diamond shape in the middle of the central island, and two more within another island to the right, separated by a single square.
** The [[Samurai quest]]; almost all the water is pools. On the locate level, there are a small number of moat squares within the castle.


==FIQHack==

Monsters in [[FIQHack]] can crawl (or teleport) out of water to save themselves from drowning.

{{Wikipedia|Dwarf}}
{{otheruses|dwarves in general|the specific monster|Dwarf (monster)}}

A '''dwarf''' is a type of [[monster]] in ''[[NetHack]]'', and is also a playable [[race]]. It also characterizes several dwarf-related monsters.

According to the guide book:
{{guidebook|Dwarves are smaller than humans or elves, but are stocky and solid individuals. Dwarves' most notable trait is their great expertise in mining and metalwork. Dwarvish armor is said to be second in quality not even to the mithril armor of the Elves.}}

== Racial benefits and restrictions ==
Dwarves are always [[lawful]]. They can be [[Archeologist]]s, [[Caveman|Cavemen]], or [[Valkyrie]]s. 

Dwarves have [[intrinsic]] [[infravision]]. From an [[attribute]] perspective, dwarves have good physical attributes (the highest dexterity and constitution), but those are offset by the lowest mental attributes. The following table outlines their maximum (unaided) attribute levels.

{| class="prettytable"
! Strength 
! Dexterity
! Constitution
! Intelligence
! Wisdom
! Charisma
|-
| 18/** || 20 || 20 || 16 || 16 || 16
|}

When playing as a dwarf, you will see yourself as {{white|@}} (unless you have [[Options#showrace|showrace]] on), but you are considered to be ''both'' {{white|@}} and {{white|h}}. For this reason, using blessed [[genocide]] to eliminate [[mind flayer]]s (entering <code>h</code> at the prompt) is a [[Bad Idea]], as it will result in an [[instadeath]]. Therefore, dwarves must use two uncursed genocides to eliminate both [[mind flayer]]s and [[master mind flayer]]s, while other characters can eliminate them both with a single blessed genocide.

Curiously, there is no dwarf role that seems especially "dwarvish"&mdash;Cavemen are primitive, Archeologists are combat-averse scientists, and Valkyries are Norse psychopomps. The typical fantasy vision of the dwarf warrior, craftsman, or miner is therefore not really available to the player of ''NetHack''.

== Dwarvish monsters ==
The monster flag M2_DWARF determines if a monster is considered to be a sort of dwarf or otherwise of dwarvish origin. The following monsters have this flag:
* {{monsymlink|dwarf}}
* {{monsymlink|dwarf lord}}
* {{monsymlink|dwarf king}}
* {{monsymlink|dwarf mummy}}
* {{monsymlink|dwarf zombie}}

== Dwarvish items ==
The following objects are defined as dwarven objects.{{refsrc|obj.h|295|nethack=3.6.1}} Strangely, the code doesn't actually use this definition anywhere.

[[Weapon]]s:
* [[Dwarvish mattock]] (broad pick)
* [[Dwarvish short sword]] (broad short sword)
* [[Dwarvish spear]] (stout spear)

[[Armor]]:
* [[Dwarvish iron helm]] (hard hat)
* [[Dwarvish mithril-coat]]
* [[Dwarvish cloak]] (hooded cloak)
* [[Dwarvish roundshield]] (large round shield)

No dwarvish [[artifact]]s currently exist in the game.

Dwarvish items are said to be exceptional metalworks, and their stats generally show this: they are superior to orcish and non-racial counterparts, and are largely better (if heavier) than elven counterparts.

== Strategy ==
With a peaceful [[Gnomish Mines]] and the best [[HP]] increase per level of any race, dwarves are arguably the strongest race in NetHack. 

Their poor spellcasting ability is largely irrelevant, as the roles that dwarves can play aren't particularly well suited to casting spells. 

Dwarven [[Valkyrie]] is often recommended as the most straightforward and beginner-friendly role.

==dNetHack==

Dwarves in [[dNetHack]] can additionally take on the [[Noble]] or [[Knight]] role. Dwarves in one of these roles get special quests, the [[Dwarf Noble]] and [[Dwarf Knight]] quest. Dwarves begin the game knowing all four [[stave-ward]]s.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy, living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible, and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them, and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible nose for precious metals.
Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

A '''leprechaun''', {{monsym|leprechaun}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is the only member of the [[leprechaun (monster class)|leprechaun]] [[monster class]].

Leprechauns have intrinsic [[teleportitis]], and approach you to try and steal any [[gold]] they see in your open inventory - they will otherwise keep their distance from you where possible. When you attack a leprechaun that is not [[Paralysis|frozen]], [[Sleep|asleep]], [[Confusion|confused]], or [[Blindness|blind]], it has a {{frac|7}} chance of moving one square away instead of being hit - this will cause you to "miss wildly and stumble forward" into that square.{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|431|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Eating a leprechaun's [[corpse]] has a 50% chance of conveying teleportitis, the highest of any corpse in the game.

{{upcoming|3.7.0|Per [https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/2591a21cf0f752331124acc52750c0f5b91c4c29 commit 2591a21]: Leprechauns that steal your gold have a chance to bury it in the ground after teleporting if their destination is in a non-shop room out of your sight.}}

==Generation==
Leprechauns are [[monster creation|normally generated]] [[sleep]]ing, and will always carry ''[[LD]]''d''30'' pieces of gold.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|764|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|1259|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} [[Leprechaun hall]]s are [[special room]]s filled with sleeping leprechauns, with each one on top of a pile of gold in a similar manner to a [[treasure zoo]].

Leprechauns are the first [[quest monster]] for the [[Rogue quest]], and several guaranteed leprechauns also appear on each floor during level creation.

==Strategy==
While they are often relatively harmless, leprechauns can use offensive wands against you, and can also generate with [[defensive item]]s like a [[wand of digging]] that can make it difficult for you to recover your gold or the wand in question.

When a leprechaun makes a successful gold-stealing attack, it teleports away; [[polymorph]]ing into a leprechaun allows you to do the same to monsters, though this has limited use. You can prevent them from robbing you by using ranged attacks or attacking in melee while carrying no gold; keep in mind that they also can steal gold from directly under your feet - it is best to bag it or stash it elsewhere, or throw it a short distance away if neither is possible.

Amusingly, using [[conflict]] in a leprechaun hall will cause them to steal from each other&mdash;but it will soon prove annoying, as this scatters them across the level.

===Credit cloning===
Leprechauns can be exploited for [[credit cloning]]: Drop all but one of your gold coins in a shop, then lure a leprechaun inside - once it picks up the pile of gold, then let it either steal your last gold piece or teleport out. Once you kill it to retrieve your gold back, you'll still have your credit - since you can only do this once per leprechaun, you should do it with as much gold as possible. Using leprechauns this way is difficult since they won't follow you, but it does mean you can credit clone even without a [[pet]] or a [[sack]].

==History==
The leprechaun is among the many monsters present in [[Hack 1.0|the very first version of ''Hack'']] by [[Andries Brouwer]], along with "Hack for PDP-11" (which was based on an early draft). In early versions such as this and [[NetHack 1.3d]], leprechuans used the {{white|L}} glyph and had slightly different behavior: they would still attempt to attack players that closed in as they attempted to keep their distance.

The ability to make player characters miss and stumble was always present; the message clarifying this was added in [[NetHack 3.6.2]].<ref>[https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/commit/bf10a70de0d5cd0f7925d77bfcfd320b7d58e7d8 NetHack commit bf10a70: Make it clear when a leprechaun dodges your attack]</ref>

==Messages==
{{message|You miss wildly and stumble forward.|A leprechaun dodged one of your attacks.}}
{{message|Your purse feels lighter.|A leprechaun hit you and stole some or all of the gold in your open inventory.}} 
{{message|Your purse feels heavier.|You stole some gold from a monster while [[polymorph]]ed into a leprechaun.}}

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Leprechaun}}
The leprechaun (Irish ''leipreachán'' or ''luchorpán'') is a diminutive supernatural being in Irish folklore, and is often classified as a type of solitary fairy; leprechaun-like creatures only became prominent in later folklore. They are usually depicted as little coat-and-hat-clad bearded folk with a tendency towards mischief, and were later portrayed as shoe-makers who have a hidden pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. The association with gold is often carried over to portrayals in media such as ''NetHack'', where they always generate with gold.

==Variants==
In variants featuring an [[object materials]] system, leprechauns are commonly given the additional ability to steal [[gold (material)|gold items]].

===SLASH'EM===
[[SLASH'EM]] introduces the [[leprechaun wizard]], a stronger form of the leprechaun that it can [[grow up]] into. They posses slightly better AC and the ability to cast clerical [[monster spell]]s. Leprechauns can also [[Monsters with hits creatures as a +x weapon (SLASH'EM)|hit as a +1 weapon]].

===xNetHack===
Leprechauns are capable of stealing gold items as well as gold pieces.

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], leprechauns are among the many [[Fey (dNetHack)|fey creatrues]] that take extra damage from iron weapons. The [[Ward (dNetHack)|wards]] [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Thjofastafur|Thjofastafur]], [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Elder Sign|Elder Sign]] and [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Cerulean Sign|the Cerulean sign]] can repel leprechauns; carving Thjofastafur into a weapon will cause that weapon to grant detection of them when wielded.

A [[gnome king|gnome-]] or [[dwarf king|dwarf]][[dwarf queen|-ruled]] [[Special room (dNetHack)#Throne room (throne occupied)|throne room]] may have leprechauns as part of its court.

===NetHack: The Next Generation===
In [[NetHack: The Next Generation]], the Key Level is a [[Special level (NetHack: The Next Generation)|special level]] that contains several leprechauns and [[nymph]]s.

===DynaHack===
In [[DynaHack]], many leprechauns are generated within the [[nymph level]] upon its creation, and the monster generation on that floor has a much higher chance of creating more.

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
under various names in different parts of Ireland:
Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
twinkling of an eye.

== Shopkeeper prevention ==
It is possible to steal from [[shopkeeper]]s. However, they have ways to prevent some methods. Here is a list of some ways that shopkeepers normally prevent you from taking their items without payment:
* ''Use a charge from an unpaid item.'' The shopkeeper will charge a usage fee. You now owe the shopkeeper money, as if you were carrying an unpaid item. Shopkeepers also charge you for reading their spellbooks.
* ''Try to walk out of the door with an unpaid item.'' The shopkeeper will stand on the entrance square, blocking your path. Because it is a [[door]], you cannot walk through diagonally.
* ''Use a [[pick-axe]] to dig a hole out of the shop.'' If the shopkeeper is adjacent, he or she will grab your "pack", thus taking everything in your inventory! This is punishment for making a hole in the shop floor.
* ''Teleport, [[throw]], or [[kick]] any items out of the shop.'' The shopkeeper will charge you for the items, as if you now own them.
* ''Walk out through a gap in the wall.'' Shopkeepers configure their shop walls to magically heal. Even if a [[dwarf]] or [[Umber hulk]] came by and left a gap while entering or exiting the shop, the gap will heal after 5 turns, assuming that there is no monster in the way.{{refsrc|eshk.h|8}}{{refsrc|shk.c|3073}}
* ''Try to trap the shopkeeper with a [[bear trap]] or [[landmine]].'' The shopkeeper will disarm and pick up the trap after 5 turns.

==Indirect theft==
For those who prefer not to steal directly, there are a few options for all the fun of theft and minimal risk.

===Using your pet===
Shopkeepers in NetHack, when it comes to taking items, do not care about any creature or monster other than you. Thus, a common practice is to let a monster or [[pet]] pick up items and drop them either outside the shop or in the square right in front of the doorway, which is considered outdoors. To obtain the shopkeeper's gold, sell valuable items back to him and repeat. This technique is sometimes known as shoplifting. The process of robbing a shop with the aid of a pet can be sped up considerably:
* Train your pet, raising its [[apport]]. When the pet drops an item near you, reward it with a treat. [[Tripe ration]]s and [[meatball]]s are treats for carnivorous pets, while apples and carrots are treats for herbivorous pets. [[Banana]]s are treats for primates. Stand in the door, and use 's' or '.' until your pet drops an item in the square directly in front of the door. This square is not considered part of the shop, so items there are free. By standing in the door, your pet cannot escape, and will bring the shop to you.
* Use a [[magic whistle]] to teleport your pet out of the shop as soon as it picks something up.
* Put all the light items you want to steal (like scrolls, rings and gems) in a [[sack]] or [[bag of holding]] (as much as your pet can carry{{reffunc|mon.c|max_mon_load}}) so it only needs to steal that one item. It can also be sold for the value of the sack and everything inside. Consider putting all your gold into the sack to build large amounts of credit.
* [[Drop]] items you don't want as far away from the entrance as possible, best with a [[cursed]] item on top of the pile. Things you want go near the entrance, in sight. That way, you can stand by the [[door]] and your [[pet]] will pick up nearby [[object]]s.

===Use a strong pet to kill the shopkeeper===
If you have a strong pet, they may be able to kill the shopkeeper for you. Large cats and dogs will not attempt this unless you have fed them [[wraith]] corpses to level them up beyond their natural growth limit. A fully-grown warhorse will attack shopkeepers but may well lose the fight.  Better pets (as from a polymorph trap) can often kill the shopkeeper easily.  As always in NetHack, neither the shopkeeper nor your god will punish you for your pet's actions, although it is considered very bad form to allow [[Izchak]] to die, even if playing an [[extinctionism|extinctionist]]. This is a faster way of obtaining all the shopkeeper's property than shoplifting, and the only way to get the wands most shopkeepers have in their personal inventory. The disadvantages are that the pet might die and that the shopkeeper will no longer be available for [[price identification]].

===Credit cloning===
{{main|Credit cloning}}
Another method of indirect theft is [[credit cloning]]: dropping gold in the store to establish credit, and then getting monsters or pets to take the gold back outside for you to repeat.

===Gelatinous cube engulfing===
Additionally, a [[gelatinous cube]]'s [[engulf]] ability can be used to completely clean out a shop's inventory of non-[[organic]] items by piling them all on a single-square near the entrance. The cube can then be lured onto the item pile, and back outside the shop again, where it can be killed to retrieve the stolen inventory. This technique works best in shops that specialize in weapons or armor, or have enough floorspace to safely store any desired [[organic]] items far away from the hungry cube.

==Direct theft==

* ''Kill the shopkeeper'': This carries the usual [[murder]] penalties, as well as being somewhat suicidal for a weak character. The presence of some items - especially a [[wand of death]] or (wand-shattering!) [[Mjollnir]] - will make this safer; indeed, this can be the best way for you to obtain such expensive items. [[Cockatrice corpse]]s also work well.
* ''Teleport the shopkeeper'': This works if you want to avoid Kops and murder. This angers the shopkeeper unless he lands in his shop. Grab all the items you want, teleport the shopkeeper, then make a run for it, or dig down with a slow implement like a pick-axe. Note that the shopkeeper will be angered if he is teleported out of his shop by ''any'' means, even if you are not (directly) related. A quantum mechanic hitting the shopkeeper during conflict will result in the shopkeeper becoming angry at '''you'''.
* ''Polymorph the shopkeeper'': For a weaker character, a properly identified [[wand of polymorph]] can be used to polymorph and then kill a shopkeeper. This allows the player to take all the items for free and carries no penalties (except for the 1-in-25 chance of [[system shock]], which counts as [[murder]], and the risk of creating a monster that could kill you.)  Note that due to their 50 [[Magic resistance (monster)|MR]] and 12 [[HD]], shopkeepers will resist the wand half the time, potentially leaving the character facing a still-human and now angry shopkeeper.
*''Dig out of the shop with unpaid items'': If you have no means of protection from the shopkeeper, you should use a fast method, like a [[wand of digging]] (not a pick-axe). If you can surround the shopkeeper with traps, monsters, or [[boulder]]s, the shopkeeper will be unable to reach you and you can slowly dig out; keep in mind, though, that shopkeepers are generated with a [[wand of striking]] and sometimes also a [[wand of magic missile]]. You can also surround yourself with [[boulder]]s and dig your way out. Finally, if the shop is large enough, even a slow implement like a pick-axe will allow you to escape. If you dig a hole downwards, the shopkeeper may follow you through your hole. If the shop is too small to use your wand of digging, you can still zap it horizontally, walk out, and let the Kops shield you from the shopkeeper when you zap it down.<br/>Reading the source, it seems the shopkeeper will always grab your non-worn/wielded items and fall down with you unless:
*#there is no available square next to you where he could teleport to
*#you are not in a radius 5 square centered on the shopkeeper
*#he cannot move.{{reffunc|shk.c|shopdig}}{{reffunc|apply.c|um_dist}}{{reffunc|mon.c|mnexto}}
* ''Jump out of the shop'': This is done with a spell or with boots of jumping, or when playing as a knight. This only takes you a few squares away, however, so you'll want to get away quickly. [[Jumping#Path|Don't bump into the wall or the shopkeeper]]. You could [[digging|dig out]] in advance a [[spellbook of light|lit]] landing space diagonally outside the door, and steal by jumping two squares diagonally through the doorway.
* ''Walk through the shop'': If you're [[polymorph]]ed into a [[xorn]] or some other creature that can walk through walls, just pick up the items and walk through the wall of the shop.
* ''Teleport out of the shop'' and/or ''steal one, get one free'': You just need to have some method of [[teleportation]], such as intrinsic [[teleportitis]], a [[wand of teleportation]], a spell, or a scroll of [[teleportation]], ready to take you and your unpaid items out of the shop. Wands or scrolls are easier to control as teleportitis might send you out of the shop before you're ready. A riskier method of teleportation for characters with low [[intelligence]] is to read a low-level [[spellbook]] and hope that it sends you out of the shop. However, the few turns of paralysis that follow make it potentially treacherous. A cursed scroll of teleportation (resulting in a level teleport) is a safer option, especially when paired with teleport control. If you can control teleporting, a good strategy to keep everyone happy is to take a cheap item and then teleport out as far away as possible. Fend off any Kops that come and when the shopkeeper nears, teleport back into the shop and steal everything. Then go back out and meet the shopkeeper and pay for the cheap item you stole originally. The shopkeeper will be happy again even though you've just taken the entire stock. Instead of paying, you can also [[tame]] him, provided you have several scrolls and can really afford to take a few hits, especially after his wands are empty. Also you can try to teleport the shopkeeper with a wand of teleportation and hide away with all non-paid items.
* ''Walk out of the shop'': If you are fast or very fast, you can use your extra moves to walk out without the shopkeeper blocking the door. You can also use a boulder to occupy the square the shopkeeper would use to block your exit, then leave while pushing the boulder out of the shop. Finally you can break the door (and be prompted to pay 400zm) which will enable you to walk out diagonally.
* ''Block the door with a trap or pit'': Set a landmine or bear trap just inside the doorway (where the shopkeeper would normally stand to keep you from leaving). The shopkeeper will avoid that square for 5 turns before removing the trap. You can either walk over the trap, or jump over it. If the trap is still present when the shopkeeper's alarm sounds, the trap will not be removed and the shopkeeper will be stuck in his shop until he is pacified (or another monster sets off the land mine). Alternatively, digging a pit on this square will prevent the shopkeeper from blocking the doorway and they will be unable to pursue once you exit the shop.<br />Shopkeepers can't remove [[web]]s, and you can spin webs when [[polymorph]]ed into a [[giant spider]] or [[cave spider]]. Spinning a web where the shopkeeper usually stands will prevent him from guarding the exit and chasing thieves until you or another monster destroys the web.
* ''Levelport'': Pick up all the items you would like to steal and [[levelport]], e.g. through a cursed or confused [[scroll of teleportation]] or a cursed [[potion of gain level]].  The typical alarm will sound and the keystone kops will be after you on the level that the shop is located.  Controlled levelporting is safe, as long as you can deal with the enemies if you go back to the shop level.  Uncontrolled levelporting carries the usual risks.
* It is possible to ''accidentally'' steal from a shop if you have uncontrolled [[teleportitis]]. This can be avoided by dropping gold in the shop to establish credit. Any items taken out of the shop without paying will be deducted from your credit.
* ''Put the shopkeeper to sleep'': A wand of sleep can put shopkeepers to sleep, but the sleep [[ray]] can miss, and even if it hits the shopkeeper has a 50% chance of resisting. A [[magic flute]] cannot miss, although the shopkeeper has a slightly higher chance of resisting the effect.

When you leave the shop, an alarm sounds and the [[Keystone Kops]] are summoned.

==Bug exploits==
* ''200 rock steal'': The maximum number of items you can be charged for in a shop is 200. Anything you pick up after your shopping bill reaches 200 item slots will be given to you for free ("You got that for free!").{{refsrc|eshk.h|10}}{{refsrc|shk.c|2093}}{{refsrc|shk.c|2210}} [http://alt.org/nethack/dudley/?552 See here for a comic-style walkthrough.]<br />The simplest way to exploit this is to find 200 [[rock]]s, name them each a different thing so they don't stack, place them in a [[bag of holding]] to reduce weight, and throw the bag into a shop. Once you pick it back up everything else you pick up is free. You can then easily sell the expensive items back to the shopkeeper repeatedly [no pet-steal necessary] to bleed him dry of cash, and build up enough credit for the price of the bag and rocks. The naming portion of the setup can be automated by a paste script as follows: assuming inventory letters of B for BoH and S for stack of rocks, start by #name-ing with the (y)es option the stack of rocks "1", then paste the string (minus quotes): "<code>aBi*&lt;CR&gt;1S&lt;CR&gt;#n&lt;CR&gt;yS</code>". That is, (a)pply the (B)ag, put (i)n (*)gems. (1) from (S)tack. and (#n)ame onl(y) the (S)tack ____. The game should be waiting for a new name for the stack, at which point you can type whatever number comes after the current stack name. Repeat with paste, name, enter, paste. The exact sequence will probably have to be adjusted as your burden level crosses boundaries, depending on your Term width, adjust as necessary. For the [[Healer]]s or others with [[stone to flesh]] as an option, you can get a very significant weight reduction by using [[meatball]]s instead. You can also use [[scrolls of mail]], but mail is priced at zero, so you will actually need about 210. After giving you the first few scrolls for free, the shopkeeper will mark them up to about 7 zorkmids each.<br />This bug has been corrected in development versions of SLASH'EM 0.0.8. (based on #nethack's Rodney)
* Overflowing the debt counter, which is stored in a signed integer. You can do this by angering the shopkeeper, putting up a boulder fort, and repeatedly dropping and picking up your gold.  However, this strategy is extremely time consuming - even with 100000 gold, it would require more than 20000 turns.

==Consequences of theft==
Indirect theft carries no in-game consequences. [[Death by boredom|Tedium]] and the chance a gecko will kill you if you are holding down the '.' key are the chief dangers.

Direct theft, however, is dangerous. First of all, successfully stealing from a shop summons Keystone Kops – they are numerous, but for higher level characters they are merely more of a nuisance. The larger worry is the shopkeeper, who tends to be both high level and equipped with dangerous wands, usually a [[wand of striking]] and/or [[wand of magic missile|magic missile]]. One extremely helpful technique is to dig a series of [[pit]] traps outside of the entrance to the shop – this will hinder the shopkeeper if he tries to leave the shop and pursue you. However, be careful when doing this in Minetown, as the watchmen will become hostile if they fall into your pit traps.

The Keystone Kops are only summoned if you leave the shop without paying with the shopkeeper present. Killing the shopkeeper, or teleporting him out of his store, does not generate Kops.

Theft carries a -1 alignment penalty for lawful characters and a +1 alignment bonus to chaotic non-[[rogue]] characters.

&&%s&& %s Experience level {146132 2022-06-09T14:41:21Z {187 Darth l33t} /* Strategy */ Your '''experience level''' in ''NetHack'' is a measure of the overall power of your [[hero]] and progress of your adventure. You start at level 1, and can level up to 30 at the highest. As you gain experience, you become better at both fighting and magic, but more difficult monsters are generated.

[[Experience points]] (XP) are the units that you accumulate to increase your level. Depending on the [[options#showexp|<tt>showexp</tt> option]], you may see a display of your XP or only see your current experience level.

== Effects ==
Gaining an experience level has a number of effects on gameplay:
=== Benefits ===
* Your maximum [[hit points]] and their recovery increase.
* Your maximum [[energy]] and its recovery increase.
* You gain an additional [[skill slot]].
* Your [[to-hit|chance of hitting]] in combat increases.
* Your chance of successfully learning spells from uncursed [[spellbook]]s increases.
* At levels divisible by three, your [[spellcasting]] success rate increases.
* The chance of your spells overcoming [[magic resistance (monster)|monster magic resistance]] increases.
* The spell of {{spell of|magic missile}} deals more damage.
* The spell of {{spell of|protection}} grants more [[AC]] at level powers of 2.
* You are more likely to convert an [[altar]].
* A [[spellbook]] granted as a [[favor]] is more likely to be a useful one.
* You are more likely to successfully play certain [[musical instrument]]s, and the range of some of their effects increases.
* You are more likely to find a [[container trap]] when searching for it.
* A [[Rogue]] deals more backstab damage.
* At specific levels, the range of the [[turn undead]] [[command]] increases, and the duration of the helplessness it causes decreases.
* High-level [[polyself]] forms last longer.
* [[Nurse]]s are more likely to raise your maximum hit points.
* The average enchantment of generated items determined by [[rne]] ''very'' slightly increases.

=== Drawbacks ===
* More difficult [[monster]]s are able to be [[monster creation|generated]], and they can be generated at higher [[monster level]]s.
* Monster [[group]]s are larger.
* Protection and other favors from an [[aligned priest]] become more expensive.
* The [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]] can summon more monsters.
* A [[squeaky board]] can awaken monsters from further away.

=== Thresholds ===
* Certain [[role]]s gain [[intrinsic]]s at specific levels.
* You must at be least level 3 to receive a [[Sacrifice#Gifts|sacrifice gift]].
* An [[elf (starting race)|elf]] gains [[sleep resistance]] at level 4.
* Lawful characters must be at least level 5 to dip for [[Excalibur]].
* [[Wizard]]s must be level 8 to invoke [[teleportitis]] at will, while other characters must be level 12.
* Monsters become more proactive about fleeing or healing themselves at levels 10 and 14.{{refsrc|src/muse.c|399|nethack=3.6.6}}
* You must be level 14 to get permission to begin the [[Quest]] from your Quest leader.
* A [[Tourist]] at level 15 is no longer automatically considered a sucker by [[shopkeeper]]s.
* The turn undead command may pacify or destroy certain classes of [[undead]] at specific level thresholds. At level 16, it may also turn [[demon]]s.

== Gaining levels ==
There are several ways to gain an experience level, ranging from obvious to somewhat obscure:
* [[Experience points]] (mostly from killing monsters)
* Quaffing a blessed or uncursed [[potion of gain level]]
* Eating a [[wraith]] corpse
* Chance from [[incubus]] or [[succubus]] encounter
* Chance when [[polymorph]]ing into your own [[race]]
* Chance of regaining a lost level when [[praying]] successfully at a coaligned [[altar]]
* Regaining a lost level when quaffing a [[potion of full healing]]. Up to half of your lost levels can be regained this way.
* Regaining a lost level when quaffing a [[potion of restore ability]]. All of your lost levels can be regained this way; all at once if the potion is [[blessed]].

You may never gain more than one experience level at a time; killing a [[water demon]] at XP1:0 will only put you on 2:39, not 4:148 as might be expected. (You can, however, gain multiple experience levels in a single turn, as for example when a beginner character manages to destroy many creatures at once with an exploding gas spore.)

If you are already at level 30, experience points will not raise your level. Except for polymorph, effects which instantly increase your level can still increase maximum HP and energy at level 30.

== Losing levels ==
The following effects can decrease your experience level:
* [[Level drain]] attacks
** [[Drain life (monster attack)|Monster attacks]]&mdash;[[vampire]] bite, [[wraith (monster class)|wraith]] touch, or [[Demogorgon]] sting
** Getting hit by [[the Staff of Aesculapius]] or [[Stormbringer]]
** Casting the {{spell of|drain life}} spell on yourself.
* Chance from [[foocubus]] encounter
* Chance when receiving a [[god]]'s anger from incorrect [[prayer]] or [[sacrifice]]
* Chance when [[polyself|polymorphing]] into your own race

[[Drain resistance]] protects against all these except polymorph.  In addition, [[magic cancellation]] protects against level drain from monster attacks.

Having a level drained puts you a single experience point below the threshold of the level you just lost.{{refsrc|src/exper.c|235|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} If you gain any experience at all, you will regain a lost level, but only one level can be restored in this way. A blessed potion of restore ability will immediately restore all lost levels to your former maximum, while uncursed potions of restore ability and blessed potions of full healing will restore one level at a time. However, full healing will only restore half of the levels that were lost (rounded up). 

When losing a level, your HP and maximum HP are both decreased by the amount they had increased when you last gained the lost level, to a minimum of one. Energy and maximum energy work similarly, down to a minimum of zero.{{refsrc|src/exper.c|214|version=NetHack 3.6.1}} Being drained below experience level one is deadly, although an [[amulet of life saving]] can rescue you, leaving you at level one with no experience.{{refsrc|src/exper.c|205|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

===Deliberate level drain===
You may sometimes want to deliberately drain levels for several reasons:
* Donation rewards from [[aligned priest]]s are cheaper at lower levels.  By draining to level 1, you may be able to cheaply buy many points of [[protection]] and enough turns of intrinsic [[clairvoyance]] to last the rest of the game.
* If you have increased your [[constitution]] or [[wisdom]] since you gained your present levels, you may drain and regain your levels to increase your maximum [[HP]] and [[Pw]].
* If you have spent [[skill]] points [[enhance|enhancing]] a skill that you no longer find useful, you may drain levels to lose skill points until the skill is un-enhanced, then regain levels and reallocate the skill points to a more useful skill.
* Lower-difficulty monsters will be [[monster creation|generated]] when your level is lower.

Be careful that you do not accidentally drain below level 1 or get killed by unexpected combat while you have low HP, no skill points, and a lower [[to-hit]].  You may want to wear an [[amulet of life saving]] as insurance.

You will probably want to regain all your lost levels with a blessed [[potion of restore ability]] after the purpose of the deliberate level drain is fulfilled.

In versions prior to NetHack 3.6.0, a bug called "[[drain for gain]]" existed.  This bug allowed players to gain an arbitrary amount of maximum HP and Pw by repeatedly lowering their stats, draining levels, regaining stats, and regaining levels, since HP and Pw loss during level drain was based on current stats.  Since NetHack 3.6.0, the HP and Pw gain are remembered when gaining a level, and the remembered amount is subtracted when draining, so this exploit no longer works: you can now only gain a finite amount of HP and Pw through drain and regain.

== Experience points required per level ==
Several [[variant]]s alter the experience requirements to reach each level; these are included in the tables below. ([[xNetHack]] and [[SpliceHack-Rewrite]] use the [[FIQHack]] column.)

{{message|Goodbye level <x>.|You lost a level as any other role.}}

==Monsters==
{{main|Monster level}}
Monsters also have experience levels, but they are largely a function of their maximum hit points. When a monster (usually a pet) kills another monster, it gains a few maximum hit points. Unlike the player, monsters do not gain current hit points when their max HP increases. Some monsters can [[grow up]] into more mature monsters by gaining experience levels.

==Strategy==
Every character must reach level 14 at some point to complete their Quest and retrieve the [[Bell of Opening]], required for the [[Invocation ritual]]. In general, levels beyond 14 only provide a real power boost for characters who are heavily into spellcasting. Other characters get more HP and to-hit chance, but [[alchemy]], [[nurse dancing]], [[Luck]], and enchanting your weapon can substitute for these boosts. The minor gains from higher levels should be weighed against the more powerful monsters that a high-level character will face.

Most characters can level up to 10 or 11 fairly easily just by killing monsters. However, since the required experience points double with each level, while the points granted by more difficult monsters rise more slowly, you will most likely have to resort to alternative leveling methods to reach level 14. For example, a level 13 character would need to descend to at least dungeon level 23 to fight a [[Jabberwock]], a rare and very dangerous monster. They would then need to kill 82 Jabberwocks just to reach level 14; most other monsters they would encounter grant far less experience.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You can bypass the Quest level requirement by killing your Quest Leader, but this comes with severe penalties. It's only recommended for speed runners or characters who have locked themselves out of the Quest, not for those who simply don't want to level up.}}

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
Getting zapped with the {{spell of|drain life}} spell or a [[wand of draining]] drains an experience level. Using [[draw blood]] to make a [[potion of vampire blood]] also drains a level, but you are put at the <em>minimum</em> experience for the new level; killing a monster won't get the level back.

In SLASH'EM, a character usually gains enough experience to reach XL 30 naturally without [[farming]]. This advantage is slightly balanced by the higher experience requirement at low levels; most early characters will be about one level lower than their vanilla counterparts.

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], [[Monk]]s receive the message "Punardarsanaya level <x>" when losing a level.

===FIQHack===

In [[FIQHack]], the EXP formula was replaced and it is generally much easier to gain new levels after level 10.

Level-draining melee attacks are no longer blocked by [[MC]], each successful attack will drain a full level.

While you are level drained, experience gain is boosted significantly.  Quaffing a [[blessed]] [[potion of full healing]] will restore all lost levels, not just half.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], it's still an exponential growth curve like vanilla, but the curve ends sooner (level 17 instead of 22), and the experience needed to progress is much less (320,000 per level instead of 10,000,000 per level). The logic being, the player can reasonably/realistically reach the maximum experience level from killing monsters only, without it being too easy to do so.

 |name=free action
 |cost=200
}}
Wearing a '''ring of free action''' gives you the '''free action''' extrinsic, which protects [[you]] from [[paralysis]].

== Identification ==

Identifying a ring of free action indirectly is difficult, since observing the effects would likely require the player to undergo a paralysis attack. Quaffing a potion of paralysis in a locked closet while standing on a permanent [[Elbereth]] or [[scroll of scare monster]] is probably the absolutely safest method. Meleeing a gelatinous cube is also relatively safe, but the paranoid may perform this under similar circumstances. Keep in mind that attacking any creature will erode Elbereth.

Dropping a ring of free action into a [[sink]] produces the message, '''"You see the ring slide right down the drain!"'''

== Effects ==

Free action includes protection from:
* Paralysis [[Trap#Container traps|container traps]]
* A [[throw]]n or [[quaff]]ed [[potion of paralysis]] or [[potion of sleeping]]
* Paralysis or stunning [[monster spell|spells]] (reduced to one turn)

In addition, protection from the paralyzing attacks of the following [[monster]]s:
* [[Floating eye]]s ("You momentarily stiffen under the floating eye's gaze!)
* [[Gelatinous cube]]s
* [[Ghoul]]s
* [[Guardian naga]]s
* [[Shade]]s
* [[Yeenoghu]]

Free action does '''''not''''':
* Protect you from being "paralyzed" by fear when an enormous [[ghost]] appears in a deserted [[temple]], or you [[chat]] to a [[skeleton]]
* Protect you from [[sleep]], except from potions of sleeping
* Protect you from [[stunning]], except from spells
* Protect you from any [[grabbing attack]]s, including [[drowning]]
* Protect you from [[Trap#^ Bear trap|bear traps]], [[pit]]s, [[spider web]]s, or any physically binding traps
* Protect you from [[stoning]]
* Allow you to move freely on the [[Plane of Air]] or [[Plane of Water]]
* Prevent you from being incapacitated by [[lightning]] in clouds on the [[Plane of Air]]
* Grant any extra [[turn]]s
* Protect against helplessness caused by [[engraving]], a [[cursed spellbook]], [[fumbling]],{{refsrc|timeout.c|330}} or [[hurtling]] through the air while [[levitating]].

[[Eating jewelry|Eating the ring]] will give you [[intrinsic]] [[sleep resistance]] instead of free action.

== Strategy ==

A ring of free action is useful enough in high-density endgame areas such as [[Moloch's Sanctum]] and the [[Astral Plane]] that some players will [[wish]] or [[polypile]] for one if they have not found one by the time they get there. Thrown potions of paralysis are quite common, and getting hit by one and paralyzed for several turns while surrounded by [[aligned priests]] or, worse, one of the [[Riders]], can be very painful or even deadly. If you go in without one, it's wise to avoid being surrounded if at all possible and have an [[amulet of life saving]] or at least some [[potion of full healing|potions of full healing]] ready for use.

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], the ring does protect against grabbing attacks, including those of both drowning monsters and [[mind flayer|mind flayers]], with a chance dependent on your Luck - 50% at 0 Luck, 90% when maxed out.  It gives the message '''"<foo> grabs you, but you quickly free yourself!"'''

&&%s&& %s Safe area {99187 2015-12-21T04:39:19Z {4000080 ChasonBot}  A '''safe area''' is a place that is (relatively) free of [[monster]]s or other hazards.  They are typically used to allow the [[adventurer]] and [[pet]]s to retreat to regenerate [[HP]], to [[identification|identify]] that stack of unknown [[potion]]s, to store or manage a [[stash]], or to perform other actions away from the threat of monsters.

There are multiple [[strategy|strategies]] to locate or create a safe area, including:
* Locate a [[sanctuary]] - a co-aligned temple. Monsters will not attack you in a sanctuary, but will flee from you, but with a few exceptions.
* After completing the first level of [[Sokoban]], use the spare boulders to block off the part of the room that contains the down [[staircase]]. There are several good reasons to use Sokoban as a safe area. ''See [[Sokoban#Strategy]]''
* Hide in a [[closet]] and [[lock]] the [[door]]. A closet is too small to bring your pet with you, but large enough to hide from most monsters during an emergency, provided that you can lock the door before some [[kobold]] opens it and blocks the door [[square]]. Be careful to not choose a closet that contains a trap.
* Find a [[room]] that features doors in all its doorways, and lock the doors. This is not a common strategy, because such rooms are rare and often at inconvenient places. If you happen to have a [[wand of locking]] or the spell of [[wizard lock]], then you can also put locked doors in the open doorways. A [[boulder]] can also block a doorway, but will not stop a ranged attack. You also have to worry about teleporting monsters (such as [[tengu]]), [[xorn]]s (which can [[phasing|phase]] through rock), tunneling monsters such as [[dwarf|dwarves]] and [[rock mole]]s, and [[giant]]s (which can break doors and lift boulders).

A safe area with a downward staircase can be especially valuable, once you have cleared the level that contains it; you can withdraw into it when badly injured from combat in the level below.

{{otheruses|the #turn command}}
The '''#turn''' ('''turn undead''') [[extended command]] allows [[Knight]]s and [[Priest]]s to frighten, and possibly even destroy or pacify, nearby undead creatures by calling upon the power of their [[deity]].

Only those two roles can use this ability.  Members of other roles using the command will attempt to cast the [[Spellbook of turn undead|turn undead spell]] if they know it, or else be told, '''"You don't know how to turn undead!"'''. You cannot turn undead if you are unable to speak.

<nowiki>#Turn</nowiki> undead is, in fact, a special sort of [[prayer]] to your [[god]], not a spell, although it doesn't affect your [[prayer timeout]].

The name comes from [[Dungeons and Dragons]], where it is a specific supernatural ability for causing undead beings to turn and flee. There are some unfortunate linguistic ambiguities associated with it in NetHack; for instance, the #turn command has the description "Turn undead", which might make a beginning player assume that it causes their character to become an undead creature!

== Effects ==
Using the #turn command has the following effects{{refsrc|src/pray.c|1995|nethack=3.6.6}}:
* You [[exercise]] [[wisdom]].
* All hostile undead monsters in range and line of sight which fail a [[Magic_resistance_(monster)|resistance]] check are turned. Turning has a range of <math>8 + xlvl / 5</math>, rounded down, where ''xlvl'' is your experience level. If you are at least level 16, hostile demons may be turned as well.
* Turned monsters will [[Scare|flee]] for an indefinite duration. These monsters are awakened if they are sleeping.
* Certain classes of undead monsters (indicated in the table below), if successfully turned, make a second resistance check. A monster which fails this check becomes peaceful if you are chaotic, or is killed instantly otherwise.
* You become helpless for up to five [[turn]]s while you are praying, putting you at risk from any unturned monsters, or even turned monsters which recover quickly enough. The paralysis is reduced by 1 turn for every 6 [[experience level]]s after the first: you are helpless for 5 turns at levels 1&ndash;6, 4 turns at levels 7&ndash;12, 3 turns at levels 13&ndash;18, 2 turns at levels 19&ndash;24, and 1 turn at levels 25&ndash;30.{{refsrc|src/pray.c|2077|nethack=3.6.6}}
* You break [[atheist]] [[conduct]].

Turning will not work correctly in the following circumstances:
* If you are [[polymorph]]ed into an undead or a demon, and your god is not chaotic, you [[abuse]] wisdom and [[aggravate]] monsters.
* If your god is [[anger|extremely angry]] with you, you abuse wisdom and aggravate monsters.
* If you are in [[Gehennom]], your god is inaccessible.  Instead, you aggravate monsters.
* If you are [[confused]], you will awaken and unparalyze all monsters you would otherwise have turned. (You will still be helpless for the normal number of turns.)

=== Destruction/Pacification ===
If you are high enough level, turned undead monsters must make a second [[Magic_resistance_(monster)|resistance]] check or be destroyed instantly, or turned peaceful if you are [[chaotic]].

It is thus theoretically possible to instantaneously destroy an [[arch-lich]] by #turning, if you are at least level 16 and beat its MR of 90 in two sequential rolls, and are outside its native [[Gehennom]].

Vampires will only have a chance of being destroyed or pacified if they are in base form ({{white|V}}), not if they are in a shapeshifted form ({{monsym|vampire bat}}{{monsym|fog cloud}}{{monsym|wolf}}), though they will still be scared when shapeshifted.

Generally, any undead that this command can kill can be disposed just as easily by hitting them until they die (again), with none of the helplessness nastiness that this command entails. However, lawful and neutral characters with enough levels will find that this is a very efficient way in clearing out [[graveyard]]s. For lawful and neutral [[Priests]], whose [[Priest quest|quest]] involves fighting through dozens of graveyards and hundreds of undead enemies, this command can probably save them hundreds to thousands of turns compared to defeating every undead they come across one at a time. Keep in mind, however, that the [[Valley of the Dead]] is considered part of Gehennom, and turn undead will not work on the graveyards there.

== History ==

Before [[NetHack 3.6.3]], you did not need to be able to speak to turn undead. Also, the prayer only worked on monsters that you could actually see, rather than only requiring an open line of sight.

== Variants ==

=== FIQHack ===
Turning undead has been buffed in [[FIQHack]] compared to vanilla.  The helplessness effect duration scales with level.  At level 1, you will be helpless for 5 turns.  At level 24 you will be helpless for 1 turn.  At level 30 you will be helpless for one action.

Note that since the [[Mitre of Holiness]] allows praying in Gehennom in FIQHack, it also allows the use of #turn.

==Before you begin==
You may find these pages helpful from an overall strategy perspective:

* [[Game stages]]
* [[Why do I keep dying?]]
* [[Notetaking]]

==The very basics==
Firstly, learn how to move your character, fight monsters and go up and down stairs. [[Movement tactics#Diagonal movement|Take advantage of diagonal movement keys.]] Pressing {{kbd|?}} brings up online help which explains the basics of playing the game and how to move your [[You|character]].

If you dislike the [[hjklyubn|default vi-style movement keys]], you may want to enable the [[Options#number_pad|number_pad option]] which lets you use the number pad to move your character. To do so, press {{kbd|O}} and select the option from the menu. On some servers (for example, [[NAO]]), that option is enabled by default. Which one is "better" is mostly a matter of personal preference.

The first lesson a new player should learn is: take it slowly! Never use the auto-repeat feature of the keyboards: press each key deliberately and carefully — and take your time. Use {{kbd|_}}, {{kbd|g}} and {{kbd|G}} to move safely down corridors.

Use {{kbd|>}} and {{kbd|<}} to go down and up stairwells — if you cannot find one, search along walls ({{kbd|s}}) until you find a doorway; you may need to search around 10 times on a bit of wall before you find one. If the [[door]] is locked and you do not have an unlocking tool, you can kick ({{kbd|ctrl|d}}, or {{kbd|k}} with number_pad enabled) the door down, although it is preferable to leave the door locked and come back later when you have found an unlocking tool.

The goal of the game is to get the [[Amulet of Yendor]] which is on level 50 or so of the dungeon, so head down slowly and explore the dungeon carefully. For now, your main goal is [[Why do I keep dying?|survival]].

When you come across a [[monster]], first look it up in this wiki to determine whether it is a good idea to fight it. Moving into the square it occupies will attack it. When fighting, watch your HP (health), and if it goes below half of its maximum, run away to heal (do not wait until you have only 1HP left!). Healing occurs slowly as you explore the dungeon (or [[rest]] ({{kbd|.}}) if you are [[burdened]]).

After you have killed a monster, you will usually want to eat its [[corpse]], but make sure that you check that monster's entry in this wiki to determine if its corpse is safe to eat. If you do not eat corpses, you will probably die of [[starvation]].

In the first few dungeon levels, do not eat [[kobold]] corpses — they are poisonous — and also do not eat the corpses of creatures you did not kill during the previous 50 turns (with the exceptions of [[lichen]]s and [[lizard]]s).

Some monsters are not safe to attack with melee — if you fight a [[floating eye]] in that manner, for instance, you may get [[Paralysis|paralyzed]] for hundreds of turns, thus becoming an easy prey to creatures lurking around; use ranged weapons or magic instead, and check this wiki for the entries of monsters you do not know to avoid such nasty surprises.

If your HP gets below 6, or in case you are "weak" with [[hunger]] or otherwise in a dire situation, use the extended command "[[Prayer|#pray]]". Do not do this more often than once every 1000 turns, though, since that may anger the [[god]] you are praying to, which would probably make things even worse for you.

Engraving "[[Elbereth]]" on the ground will stop most monsters from attacking you and cause them to turn to flee while the word remains intact; during an emergency, you can write it in the dust by typing {{kbd|E}}, then {{kbd|-}}, then "Elbereth", but then it will not last long — there are ways of making it more durable, so it pays to learn about [[engraving]].

==The early game==
The goals of the early game are completing the first two branches off the main dungeon — [[Sokoban]] and the [[Gnomish Mines]] — and gathering basic supplies and resistances. You may find some nice armor or [[sacrifice]] for a shiny artifact weapon, but such luck does not always happen.

===Goals===
* Gain [[magic resistance]] and [[reflection]]. These two defenses counter many powerful attacks that would otherwise harm your equipment, severely damage you, or even kill you. They cannot be gained intrinsically, and must be provided by worn or carried equipment, such as [[dragon scale mail]] or [[quest artifact]]s. Because they are so vital to survival, are rarely randomly generated, and often come packaged with other useful attributes, many early [[wish]]es are spent to gain one or the other.
* Gain [[poison resistance]]. Without poison resistance, any [[poison]]ed attack or trap has a chance of being instantly fatal. Several classes acquire poison resistance intrinsically early in the game, but others will want to consume monsters that provide a [[Poison resistance#Safe corpses|safe chance]] of getting this valuable resistance. A [[unicorn horn]], [[tinning kit]], [[ring of sustain ability]], or source of [[restore ability]] can also help you by allowing you to consume poisonous corpses (including many that confer poison resistance) without suffering attribute loss.
{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Unicorn horns no longer restore lost attributes.  Also, poison no longer has a chance of instantly killing you, but it can do a significant amount of extra damage and drain your attributes.}}
* Complete [[Sokoban]]. Sokoban has wands, rings, and one of either a [[bag of holding]] or an [[amulet of reflection]], both of which are quite useful. It is also no-teleport, which makes cornering [[unicorn]]s for horn harvesting or gem tossing very easy.
* Complete the [[Gnomish Mines]]. The Mines are the first branch, but some players consider it to be dangerous, as it is inhabited by swarms of dwarves and gnomes — which, individually, are slow and weak, but tend to gang up, and may be [[offensive item|generated with wands]] that will kill you very fast. However, [[Minetown]] may contain many shops and is guaranteed to contain a temple, so it is an excellent place for [[price identification]], [[Curse-testing#Altar testing|BUC testing]], [[protection|donating to a priest]], and finding useful loot. Particularly dangerous traps may be generated below Minetown, so it is not recommended that you venture down unless you have some method of dealing with them. However, there is a [[luckstone]] at the bottom of the Mines, which is a useful thing to carry around once you can get your luck up.
* Gather useful knick-knacks. Any pieces of your [[ascension kit]] are great, but you will want to gather other things that will be useful later on. Potions can be [[alchemy|alchemized]] or watered down for blessing, scrolls can be blanked, and extra magic armor and tools can be saved for later [[polypiling]].
