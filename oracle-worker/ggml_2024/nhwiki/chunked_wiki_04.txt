==Unique items==
{{main|unique item}}
Although similar to artifacts in some respects, these items are implemented as unique item types, rather than base items with names. Wishing for one doesn't violate artifact-wishless conduct (and also doesn't work, except in [[wizard mode]]). They will always be replaced by different items in bones piles. The only things they have in common with true artifacts is that they're unique, and they add to your [[score]] if you [[ascend]] with them.

==UnNetHack==

In [[UnNetHack]]:
*[[Dragonbane]] is instead a [[dwarvish spear]] that confers all dragon-breath resistances (instead of reflection) when wielded. It also warns against dragons and has a chance of instantly killing them.
*[[Giantslayer]] is instead a sling that grants 18/** strength when wielded. The strength bonus remains when the sling is exchanged to the alternate weapon slot.
*[[Itlachiayaque]], a shield of reflection that grants ESP and does not hinder spellcasting, replaces the Orb of Detection as the [[archaeologist]] quest artifact.
*[[The Iron Ball of Liberation]] is the quest artifact for the [[convict]] role.
*[[Luckblade]] is a neutral [[broadsword]] that has a flat +5 to-hit and damage bonus and acts as a luckstone when carried.
*[[Thiefbane]] is carried by [[Black market (UnNetHack)#One-eyed Sam|One-eyed Sam]] in the [[Black market (UnNetHack)|Black Market]]. Be very afraid.

&&%s&& %s Weapon {150276 2023-03-21T03:03:34Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} can place this nearer to the top {{items}}
In ''[[NetHack]]'', a '''weapon''' is an item used to attack opponents.

==Description==
Most weapons are [[wield]]ed with {{kbd|w}} and used to hit enemies; you cannot wield a weapon if you are [[body parts|handless]] or [[physical size|tiny]].{{refsrc|mondata.h|106}} To attack with a wielded weapon, simply try to move into a monster's space, or use {{kbd|Shift|F}} to attack in any direction.

Some weapons are [[missile]]s that are designed to be [[thrown]] with {{kbd|t}} (or {{kbd|f}} to fire quivered weapons), and others require a [[launcher]] to be wielded in order to shoot them as ammo - still other items are not designed as weaponry, but can be improvised to serve as one, such as a [[cream pie]]. Hitting monsters properly with weapons can increase your [[training]] in that weapon. 

[[You]] can ready a second weapon for use, and use {{kbd|x}} to exchange between your primary and secondary weapons. Some roles can wield both weapons at once using the #[[twoweapon]] command. Pressing {{kbd|w}}, then {{kbd|-}} will unwield your current weapon and have you fight empty-handed; this is the default for [[Monk]]s, who excel in fighting without a weapon, and [[Tourist]]s that start the game without a [[tin opener]].

===Weapon generation===
Randomly generated weapons have the following total probability of beatitude and enchantment:{{refsrc|src/mkobj.c|768|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

{|class="wikitable"
!!!+0!!+1!!+2!!+3!!+4!!>+4
|-
| style="background: lightgray; color: black;" | Blessed||4.09%||3.03%||1.01%||0.34%||0.11%||0.06%
|-
| style="background: lightgray; color: black;" | Uncursed||73.64%||3.03%||1.01%||0.34%||0.11%||0.06%
|-
!!!+0!!-1!!-2!!-3!!-4!!<-4
|-
| style="background: lightgray; color: black;" | Cursed||4.09%||6.06%||2.02%||0.67%||0.22%||0.11%
|}

Given the BUC status, the chance of enchantment is:
{|class="wikitable"
!!!+0!!+1!!+2!!+3!!+4!!>+4
|-
| style="background: lightgray; color: black;" | Blessed||47.37%||35.09%||11.70%||3.90%||1.30%||0.65%
|-
| style="background: lightgray; color: black;" | Uncursed||94.19%||3.88%||1.29%||0.43%||0.14%||0.07%
|-
!!!+0!!-1!!-2!!-3!!-4!!<-4
|-
| style="background: lightgray; color: black;" | Cursed||31.03%||45.98%||15.33%||5.11%||1.70%||0.85%
|}

After the type of weapon is chosen, if an artifact matching the base type exists, there is a 5% chance that the weapon is converted into an artifact.

Poisonable weapons are generated as poisoned 1% of the time.

===Weapons and erosion===
Many weapons are subject to possible [[erosion]] from various sources, such as [[rust trap]]s and monsters with eroding attacks (typically in the form of a [[passive]] attack); erosion can significantly reduce a weapon's effectiveness. Most [[metallic]] weapons can rust or corrode, while [[wood]]en weapons can be burnt.

A weapon can be made erodeproof by wielding it as a primary weapon and reading a [[scroll of enchant weapon]] while confused; this also repairs any current erosion on the weapon in question. Some weapons can also have their erosion repaired by dipping the weapon in a [[potion of oil]].

(‰) Relative probability.<ref>http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/weap-343.html</ref> Figures are given as probability in a thousand, or [[wikipedia:permille|permille]].

(<sup>†</sup>) Objects are significantly more common in play than their probability would otherwise imply due to [[monster starting inventory]] or certain [[trap]]s.

(1) When the user is riding, the lance gets an additional 2d10 in case of a successful [[joust]]. The victim is also automatically [[stunned]] and thrown back a square.

(2) This is a projectile weapon that is meant to be thrown or fired, not wielded, in order to deal damage.

A significant part of ''NetHack'' strategy comes down to weapon selection. On a basic level, [[curse-testing]] any weapons you find before wielding them is ideal, whether it be via a starting [[pet]] or an [[altar]].

===Erodeproofing===
Once you have settled on your main weapon(s), erodeproof them as soon as you can in order to preserve their damage output. The urgency of this varies with your role and weapon(s) of choice: for instance, while most wooden and organic weapons risk being burnt, this is only a risk against monsters with fiery passive attacks (i.e. the [[fire elemental]], [[fire vortex]], and [[red mold]]), and [[fire trap]]s also do not affect weapons.{{refsrc|src/trap.c|3124|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Therefore, you can save scrolls of enchant weapon by switching to a metallic weapon or other burn-proof alternative against those monsters.

===Weapons and monster size===
[[File:NHC-Monster-Sizes.png|thumb|right|Monsters by size]]
{{main|Physical size}}
Another aspect of weapon selection is accounting for the [[physical size]] of hostile monsters that you will face in the various stages of the game. As shown in [[#Table of weapons and their properties|the table above]], various weapons have different hit dice against monsters depending on whether they are ''small'' (medium-sized or smaller) or ''large'' (large-sized or bigger).

The majority of monsters in the game are classified as small; this includes most of the monsters you encounter early on, with large monsters being intermittent and often more difficult in comparison. In contrast, the mid-game tends towards a mix of medium-sized monsters and larger; during the late game and end game, a majority of the most threatening monsters you will face - the [[Wizard of Yendor]], the [[high priest of Moloch]], and many of the [[Astral Plane]] denizens - are at least medium-sized, with most of the [[demon prince]]s in [[Gehennom]] being ''large'' minus the dangerous but rarely-seen [[Dispater]].

===Fighting weaponless===
In addition to being the preferred combat style of Monks, unwielding a weapon is viable if you must take on weapon-hazardous [[monster]]s such as [[acid blob]]s or [[rust monster]]s in melee, provided you lack a resistant weapon (e.g. a silver weapon or [[unicorn horn]]).

''<sup>1</sup> Scroll is more common than its probability would imply due to [[monster starting inventory]].''<br />
''<sup>2</sup> Scroll is more common than its probability would imply due to [[paper golem]]s' [[death drop]]s.''<br />
''<sup>3</sup> Scroll is more common than its probability would imply due to inaccessable [[closet]]s. ''

==Generation==

Scrolls constitute 16% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 18% in containers, 22% on the Rogue level, and 1% in Gehennom. Scrolls appear 1/8 cursed, 3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.

On top of random generation, scrolls can be found in book [[shops]], in [[bones]] files, and amongst the possessions of recently deceased monsters.

==Writing scrolls==

{{main|Magic marker}}

The Ink column gives the greatest number of [[magic marker]] charges required to write a scroll. The actual number of charges used will be a random amount from Ink/2 to Ink-1; if your marker has fewer than Ink/2 charges, you will be unable to attempt to write the scroll.

Wizards have a base 1/3 chance of writing an unknown scroll, and all other classes have a base 1/15 chance; your chance generally improves with higher [[Luck]], to a maximum of about 98% for Wizards and 32% for other classes. You can only write scrolls on blank paper, which can be made by getting any scroll wet (except mail) or cancelling any scroll (except mail). Failure to write the scroll will cause the blank scroll to be used up. You can select non-blank scrolls to write on, but this will abuse your wisdom and you will be told, "That scroll is not blank!" You need hands to write a scroll.

==Reading scrolls==

All scrolls take one turn to read and are destroyed if successfully read, except for the [[scroll of blank paper]] which has no effect.

To read a scroll, you must either be unblind or know the appearance of the scroll. When a scroll is read, it will be used up and disappear (except blank paper). The effects depend on the blessing of the scroll. Non-cursed means either blessed or uncursed. If you are confused while reading the scroll, "you mispronounce the magic words" and may obtain a different effect (this applies to confused monsters reading scrolls, too). Some scrolls have a different message for "beginners"; a character is considered a beginner until accumulating 2000 score points (1000 for [[wizard]]s). See the individual scroll articles for details on each scroll.

==Identification==

===Scare monster===
There are several ways to indirectly identify the scroll of scare monster:
* You stand on the scroll and adjacent monsters turn to flee (including pets & shopkeepers)
* You pick up the scroll and it turns to dust
* You are a [[Priest|Priest(ess)]], and a scroll changes its [[BUC]] when you pick it up
* You find the scroll under the [[Sokoban]] prize or the chest with the wand of wishing at the [[Castle]]

===Price===
{{main|Price identification}}

Scrolls of {{of|scroll|identify}}, {{of|scroll|light}}, {{of|scroll|enchant weapon}}, {{of|scroll|enchant armor}} and {{of|scroll|remove curse}} are pretty easy to identify by price. The more expensive scrolls, with base costs of 100 zm or more, are much more difficult to distinguish.

Here are the inconvenient and dangerous scrolls of each price class. A more detailed guide to price-identifying scrolls is [[Price identification#Scrolls|here]].

{|class="prettytable"

|-
|rowspan="2"|300
|{{of|scroll|genocide}}
|Genociding your own race if confused
|-
|{{of|scroll|punishment}}
|Being chained to an iron ball
|}

===Monster use===
Monsters can be generated with scrolls of teleportation, earth, and create monster. If you observe them reading said scrolls, that identifies to scroll to you.

===Position===
Scrolls of earth can be identified by the guaranteed ones in the first level of [[Sokoban]]. Scrolls of teleportation are the only ones generated inside [[closet]]s.  Scrolls of scare monster are placed under the Sokoban prize and the chest with the wand of wishing at the [[Castle]].

===Reading===
Many veteran players will not read an unidentified scroll unless they have a pretty good guess what it could be. Nonetheless, if you are desperate and you have a large variety of price-identified, pet-tested scrolls in your inventory, you may try to identify them by reading them.

====Precautions====
You should not try to read-identify scrolls if the game considers your character a [[beginner]]. If your character is a beginner, then several scrolls have a possibility of giving the message "You have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes." If your character is not a beginner, then it will be possible to distinguish all scrolls by the messages and effects obtained by reading them.

BUC-testing scrolls before reading them is important: some scrolls are much more deadly when cursed.

Some scrolls are less dangerous if read while confused. However, the [[scroll of genocide]] can kill you instantly if read while confused, so read-identification while confused is not universally helpful. Don't be blind or hallucinating.

Beware of the scroll of amnesia. There is no defense against the possibility of losing up to 25% of your discoveries.

The table below summarizes precautions for reading unidentified scrolls. Some precautions may contradict: you need other means of identification to assist in these cases.

{|class="prettytable"
!Scroll

==Messages==
When you read a scroll, you receive the following messages:
{{message|As you read the scroll, it disappears.|You are not blind, have a mouth and read a scroll. Effects of the scroll happen.}}
{{message|As you pronounce the formula on it, the scroll disappears.|You are blind, have a mouth and know either the magic words or the identity of the scroll. Effects of the scroll happen.}}
{{message|As you cogitate the formula on it, the scroll disappears.|You are blind, have no mouth and know either the magic words or the identity of a scroll. Effects of the scroll happen.}}
{{message|Being blind, you cannot read the formula on the scroll.|You are blind but have neither seen the magic words nor identified the scroll. No effects happen and the scroll is not destroyed.}}

==Strategy==

Scrolls, along with [[potion]]s and [[comestible|comestibles]], are one of the main types of consumable items in the game. The fact that they can only be used once tends to encourage hoarding; if you notice yourself frequently dying with large numbers of unused scrolls, consider using them next time!

For scroll-specific strategy tips, see the individual articles.

==Encyclopedia entry==

{{encyclopedia|
And I was gazing on the surges prone,
With many a scalding tear and many a groan,
When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,
Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.
I knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp'd
Those treasures--touch'd the knuckles--they unclasp'd--
I caught a finger: but the downward weight
O'erpowered me--it sank. Then 'gan abate
The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst
The comfortable sun. I was athirst
To search the book, and in the warming air
Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.
Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on
My soul page after page, till well-nigh won
Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,
I read these words, and read again, and tried
My eyes against the heavens, and read again.
|[ Endymion, by John Keats ]

This is the '''NetHackWiki''', an unofficial resource and community site for ''[[NetHack]]'', the [[roguelike]] computer game. It contains game information, [[spoiler]]s, and other information related to both ''NetHack'', and related games such as [[SLASH'EM]]. NetHackWiki has many volunteer authors... including [[you]], should you choose to help! This web site is a '''[[wiki]]'''; you can '''edit''' any page to improve it.

NetHackWiki, like most ''NetHack'' sites on the Internet, has no official affiliation with ''NetHack'' or ''NetHack'''s [[DevTeam]] (although several members of the Dev Team do have accounts here).

=== But what is ''NetHack?'' ===
'''''[[NetHack]]''''' is a one-player fantasy game for your computer. It is a multiplatform game, and runs on [[BeOS]], [[DOS]], [[Mac OS]], [[Windows]], [[Unix]], and some others. You can visit its official site at http://www.nethack.org to download the game and its [[source code]]. Or instead of downloading the game, you can play on a [[public server]] such as [[nethack.alt.org]].

Like many roguelike games, ''NetHack'' emphasises gameplay over graphics; the entire game is drawn in [[ASCII]]. (There are, however, a few versions using graphical [[user interface|tile]]s.) You, the [[player]], who most of the time appears as an {{white|@}}, must descend the [[staircase]]s into the [[Mazes of Menace|dungeon]] to search for and retrieve the [[Amulet of Yendor]] for your [[god]]. (In most games, a [[monster]] will kill you!)

=== What is a wiki? ===

A '''[[wiki]]''' is a web site that allows users to change any page using a web browser, with out needing complicated technical knowledge.

When you edit here, MediaWiki will save your IP address, unless you
[[Special:Userlogin|register a username and password and login]]. We strongly recommend that frequent editors login so that we can recognise you by name. 

The easiest way to see what other users are doing is to visit the '''[[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]]'''.

=== Free as in freedom ===
''NetHack'' is '''[[free]]''' software: the [[NetHackWiki:NetHack General Public License|NetHack General Public License]] provides that, "Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things." Likewise, this wiki is free documentation: the [https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html text of the GNU Free Documentation License] provides that each NetHackWiki page gives everyone "the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially."

                    NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    (Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)

               (Based on the BISON general public license,
                   copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording to
 make the terms for other programs.

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of
those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack.  To make sure that you get the rights we
want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  Hence this license
agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you
want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies
of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for NetHack.  If NetHack is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
not what we distributed.

  Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make
the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or
change NetHack.


                        COPYING POLICIES

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on
all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack
program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
(including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the
following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
    changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part
    thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms
    identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you
    may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option)

    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
    in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
    machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site.  (This
    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)

For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source
distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the
files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as
expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to
use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically
terminated.  However, parties who have received computer software programs
from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


Stated plainly:  You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts
