* Someone ought to say it. The DevTeam has made one hell of a great game, and I think they're done. Whatever comes after NetHack will come from a different direction entirely.--[[User:Ckbryant|Ckbryant]] 16:26, 28 January 2008 (UTC)
* I agree. I guess they are working on something way too big for them, and either someone else will preemt them or the remaining fan base will be too diehard conservative to accept their work when / if it is released. There should be a wiki page "currently visible development" that tracks all of the variants and how playable they are, together with a note the Devteam hasn't delivered since 2004 (but a hell of a game until then). -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 16:23, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
* I agree as well... I don't think they are going to release anything new. I've moved on to Dwarf Fortress personally... Magma flood anyone?
* Sign me up for "never", too; at this point, with 3.4.3 having been released in *2003*, more than six years ago, it seems increasingly unlikely to me there'll ever be any more releases: otherwise, I'd at least have expected a 3.4.4 bugfix release that'd take care of things like the astral call bug. My personal guess would be that the dev team, one by one, will move on to other things, and the current trunk will perish in some private repo somewhere without anyone ever seeing it. ...but hey, on the upside, if this turns out to not be true, I can only be positively surprised. :) -- [[User:Schneelocke|Schnee]] 22:22, April 22, 2010 (UTC)
* I must agree as well, probably never.  Although, it remains to be seen if something like Linley's Dungeon Crawl -> Stone Soup will happen.  Probably not, but it's not impossible. -[[User:Ion frigate|Ion frigate]] 07:41, 5 January 2011 (UTC)
* Time to let Vanilla go.  [[UnNetHack]] and [[SporkHack]] are in active development and are not shy about providing access to the latest code (as opposed to the "dev team" that wouldn't even release bug fixes, even though they have 468 bugs marked as "fixed").
*Let's consider the possibility that, since TDTTOE, they are counting on the eventuality of the unofficial development community  producing enough useable ideas and even new content to suddenly swoop down from on high and incorporate it into the next version- unless they all die of old age first, in which case not only do we not get a next official version, but we'll have to change the acronym to TDTTOAE. [[User:EvilM00s|EvilM00s]] 0954 CST, 17 August 2012
* Almost ten years without releasing even bugfixes? It is safe to assume that vanilia is dead - fortunately there is still [[UnNetHack]] and other active variants [[User:Bulwersator|Bulwersator]] ([[User talk:Bulwersator|talk]]) 17:41, 26 March 2013 (UTC)
* It seems highly unlikely. The news about leaked versions from 21 Sep 2014 just confirms that they still exist, but they're being as obscure about releasing new versions as ever. And even if there was a new version, how much different from 3.4.3. could it really be? If there were any major changes I'd probably just port them over to [[Slash'EM Extended]] and continue playing that. :) --[[User:Bluescreenofdeath|Bluescreenofdeath]] ([[User talk:Bluescreenofdeath|talk]]) 10:57, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
:*No offense, but that's rather conceited of you (and I mean that in the best possible way).  I mean, in a purely objective sense, the <b>exact same features</b> will be completely different in Slash'EM Extended and in NetHack.  Basically what I'm saying is that even if you ported over the features <b>exactly</b> as they appeared in NetHack next version, they would play differently because everything else is different.

&&%s&& %s Cheating {150060 2023-03-05T14:23:29Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} I figured "long and involved process that requires infinitely more effort than just getting to the right high altar" would be cause for second-guessing but... '''Cheating''' is the act of doing things in a game that is intended to garner an (often unfair) advantage through means not intended by its [[developers]] and/or considered to be against the "spirit" of the game.

==What is and isn't cheating==
As what falls under the curtain of "cheating" is a subjective matter, especially where it related to ''NetHack'', it may help to start with some "obvious" examples of what does ''not'' constitute cheating:

* Using [[explore mode]] or [[wizard mode]], provided any resulting ascensions are not claimed as genuine.
* Engraving [[Elbereth]], as this is a gameplay feature.
* [[Price identification]], given that associating certain scrolls with their prices is effectively basic pattern recognition.
* [[Credit cloning]]. Shopkeeper code is complex and carefully crafted, and the ability to dupe them using this method suggests that it was left in for crafty players to discover and utilize. Additionally, the [[Rogue]] starts the game with a [[sack]] that can be used for credit cloning, and is essentially the "thief" role of the game.

==Dubious actions==
The legitimacy of these actions, on the other hand, is somewhat more unclear and subject to discussion, and even some controversy. While most people would not refer to these as "cheating", some of these would be considered poor form at worst depending on who you ask.

===Farming===
While [[farming]] is considered by some to be against the spirit of ''NetHack'', there are few rules or protections and nothing in the game explicitly disallowing farming in general, so other people consider farming a legitimate strategy. Even at its most extreme, however, farming does not ''fully'' guarantee victory, and excessive farming can potentially prove counterproductive with the tedium outweighing the benefits. In addition, the DevTeam has taken steps to curtail more genuinely game-breaking methods of farming.

For specifics on each type of farming, visit the following pages:

* [[Altar scumming]]
* [[Death farming]]
* [[Kraken farming]]
* [[Polypiling]] (considered "farming" when taken to significant enough measures)
* [[Pudding farming]]
* [[Start scumming]]

===Reading spoilers===
NetHack is a difficult game by design, and knowing how to bypass every single problem presented is considered to be against the spirit of the game. However, even for the most spoiled players, applying that knowledge is still a significant matter of skill - reading about something is far different from experiencing it first-hand, and not all of that knowledge will be applicable or even required during a given ascension attempt. Explore mode is intended to allow newer players to experience the game without having to constantly fear character death; other people also consider spoilers to be a kind of "missing manual", and many players choose to spoil themselves voluntarily.

The community does ''not'' consider spoilers to be an "ethical" problem by and large - but as with other communities, common courtesy and good public forum etiquette dictate that warning others ahead of time to prevent inadvertent spoiling is ideal when discussing aspects of the game.

===Out-of-game notes===
Many players take minor notes, such as which levels have altars or shops, where their stashes are, and the like; some other players believe too many out-of-game notes constitutes a mild form of cheating, as it renders [[amnesia]] ineffective. On top of many methods for extensive note-taking existing within the game already, such as [[engraving]] and the ability to [[call]] and [[name]] objects, the [[NetHack 3.6.0]] series grants players the ability to [[annotate]] the current level. This, along with the potential length of an average ''NetHack'' game and the amount of information needed to navigate effectively, seems to have mostly quelled the debate on this matter.

===Metagaming===
As many servers create and post dumpfiles upon a game's end, players can use '''metagaming''' to gain an advantage, most often by looking up the inventory of killed characters through their dumplogs and matching them to a [[bones]] file encountered in-game. While this allows the player to easily gain knowledge they would not have by skipping item sorting and identification, most of the skill involved is not completely removed from the equation - that player still has to contend with the previous character's killer, as well as hostile monsters potentially grabbing their leftover items and using them against the player. In addition, much of the appropriated inventory will be cursed, requiring that player to uncurse those items to get the desired use out of them.

==Probably cheating==
The following actions are more commonly considered to be poor form and even cheating to a degree:
 
* Exploiting a [[software bug|bug]] - this is distinct from discovering a bug that would potentially benefit you or another player
* Changing the system clock to obtain a more advantageous [[moon phase]]
* Bones stuffing

===Bones stuffing===
Bones stuffing consists of playing a game to gather useful items (up to and including a full [[ascension kit]]) and then deliberately killing that character to leave a bones pile for another player to exploit. In more extreme cases, the identities of [[randomized appearance|randomized]] items are [[engrave]]d on the floor to aid future players. Bones stuffing is not considered exploitation and, technically speaking, is within the rules of the game; however, most regard it as violating the spirit of the game (e.g., a [[pacifist]] character who ascends using a "bones-stuffed" ascension kit would not generally be considered a legitimate ascension). An exception would be something that explicitly sets out to use prepared bones beforehand, like a [[speed ascension]].

Bones stuffing on a multi-user system (e.g. a server) is less likely to succeed, as it is possible that another player will get the benefit of your bones pile. In addition, some servers such as [[NAO]] make use of bones "pools" to reduce the effectiveness of stuffing, as well as deter people from using bones to intentionally create difficult situations for other players.

It is important to remember that encountering and making use of bones piles is a legitimate action by itself, even those containing full ascension kits - the difference is the deliberation inherent in bones stuffing, as opposed to more "normal" bones piles resulting from an 'honest' (albeit failed) attempt to survive. For those who do not want a lucky bones file to interfere with the challenge, or simply prefer not to use bones in general, they can set [[Options#bones|the corresponding option]] to false in their rcfile.

==Definitely cheating==
None of the methods of cheating described below are intended to be possible on a multi-user system. The file permissions will prevent you from fiddling with the game files, and you will not be allowed to play in wizard mode. Abusing the random number generator, however, may be possible if it has not been specifically [[patch]]ed.

===Save scumming===
[[Save scumming]] is the practice of copying a NetHack save file from the [[Playground|NetHack playground]], so that if the character dies or suffers a calamity, the game can be restored by copying the file back into the playground. This directly bypasses a major design decision of the game&mdash;to disallow saving-and-restoring. However, it can also be used as an aid to learn how to play initially, although [[explore mode]] may be a much better option. In addition, backing up saves may be required to safeguard against sudden crashes on some systems.

===Quit scumming===
Some players believe that the object identification game is the heart of NetHack, which makes it all the more remarkable that an unscrupulous player can completely short-circuit this aspect of the game through a technique derived from save scumming. Simply save your game, make a backup copy of your save file, and restart. Then [[quit]] the game, and you can have all of your possessions identified. Restore your backup, and you've completely eliminated one of the deepest elements of NetHack. <!--(This method of cheating can be used even on a multiuser system by saving the game, then reloading the save in [[explore mode]], choosing to keep the original save, then quitting and continuing the original game outside explore mode. The [[DevTeam]] consider this to be a bug, and intend to patch it in the [[next version]].) What came of this, if anything?-->

===Resetting individual levels===
You can revert an individual dungeon level to a previous state using the following technique:
* While playing, locate the directory containing your save files.
* Look for a file named "[user name]-[player name].[dungeon level]".
* Copy that file into a different directory.
* When you want to revert the level, delete the original file and replace it with the copy. The level will be in the same state it was when you copied it.

In this way, you can duplicate money, items, pets, and monsters.

You ''must not save and restore'' between copying out and copying in.  If you do, the process ID in the level file will not match the ID of the current process.  The game will detect the manipulation (the level file might even belong to a different game) and declare a [[trickery]].

===Selectively deleting bones===
It is possible to delete bones files. If you do this selectively, deleting only the ones that you think will kill you again, this is cheating. If you always delete all bones files including ones you would be glad to find, this is not cheating, as it is the equivalent of playing every game on a fresh install.

NetHack has a limited ability to detect cheating done by fiddling with the game files. If it finds something suspicious, a [[death (character)|death]] by [[trickery]] is likely.

===Wizard mode bones===
Should a wizard mode character die, and remain dead (as the player is given a possibility to resurrect him/her), the player can choose to leave a [[bones]] file of them for others to find, including characters not in wizard mode. Thus, a wizard mode player can wish for practically every item in the game, drop the items to the ground, and commit suicide in order for another character (usually them) to find the bones file left by the character. Of note is that the [[invocation artifacts]] and the current class's [[quest artifact]] will be replaced with normal items of the same type, and the [[Amulet of Yendor]] will be replaced with a [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]].

===Abusing the random number generator===
A sufficiently determined player can find the seed of the [[random number generator]] after starting the game and then use it to their advantage, e.g. to gain an unlimited number of [[wish]]es from a [[fountain]]. While this has been demonstrated as possible, it is ultimately a proof-of-concept and generally unlikely to see much actual use.<ref>https://pellsson.github.io/</ref><ref>https://redd.it/adbgzd</ref>

===Hangup saves===
Deliberately provoking a [[hangup]] save can be used to "awake" on a [[sleeping gas trap]], to escape [[hole]]s you [[dig]], to avoid dropping [[scrolls of scare monster]] or inserting a [[wand of cancellation]] into a [[bag of holding]] when you realize you accidentally selected your entire inventory, or to obtain a [[price identification|price quote]] for objects a [[shopkeeper]] would not normally sell.

The '''wumpus''', {{monsym|wumpus}}, is a monster that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Generation==
The wumpus is randomly generated at a relatively rare rate, though not nearly as rare as other monsters. 

Wumpuses generated at level creation have an 80% chance to start off [[asleep]]; any wumpuses generated after level creation after you have picked up the [[Amulet of Yendor]] will always generate awake.{{refsrc|makemon.c|1035}}

The [[Ranger quest]] locate level will always generate a wumpus on the downstairs.

==Strategy==
The wumpus is very slow, but has a strong bite attack and can cling to ceilings, allowing it to generate over and move past [[moat]]s without [[drowning]] or being relocated. Even so, its sluggish movement makes it an easy target for any player with good kiting or ranged attacks at their disposal, and it has no resistances whatsoever to boot.

While not particularly desirable as a [[pet]] due to its extremely low speed, the wumpus's clinging ability allows you to [[ride]] a pet wumpus over water.

==Origin==
This monster is derived from the early [[text adventure]] game ''[[Wikipedia:Hunt the Wumpus|Hunt the Wumpus]]''; the Ranger quest locate level that it appears in is an homage to the game.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since 
he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift. If you
try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
Wumpus is a sedentary creature.

&&%s&& %s Archeologist {150253 2023-03-17T23:06:43Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* Intrinsics */ upcoming {{Languages}}
{{Wikipedia|Archaeology}}

The '''Archeologist''' is one of the roles in ''NetHack''. They are often called '''Arc'''s for short and start the game with [[speed]] and [[stealth]].  Archeologists can be of [[lawful]] or [[neutral]] alignment, and can be [[human (starting race)|human]], [[dwarf (starting race)|dwarf]], or [[gnome (starting race)|gnome]].

Due to having low average starting physical [[attribute]]s and starting equipment that is less useful in combat than that of most other roles, Archeologists are often considered one of the [[role difficulty|harder roles]] in ''NetHack''.  However, they can become powerful in the late game.

According to the [[guidebook]]:

 Archeologists understand dungeons pretty well; this
 enables them to move quickly and sneak up on the local nasties.
 They start equipped with the tools for a proper scientific expedition.

The Archeologist role, especially its starting equipment, is influenced by 1954's ''[[Wikipedia:Secret of the Incas|Secret of the Incas]]'' where Harry Steele (Charlton Heston) is a dashing explorer of ancient ruins with leather jacket and fedora. ''[[Wikipedia:Raiders of the Lost Ark|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''<nowiki/>'s Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was inspired by ''Secret of the Incas'' and added—in 1981—the army bag (sack) and bullwhip that this role carries to the iconic archeologist image. 

==Starting equipment==

*+2 [[bullwhip]]
*+0 [[leather jacket]]
*+0 [[fedora]]
*3 to 6 uncursed [[food ration]]s
*+0 [[pick-axe]]
*uncursed [[tinning kit]] (30 to 99 charges),
*uncursed [[touchstone]]
*uncursed [[sack]]
*Following chances of one of:
**10%   uncursed [[tin opener]]
**22.5% uncursed [[oil lamp]]
**6.75% uncursed [[magic marker]] (30 to 99 charges)

==Intrinsics==

Archeologists gain the following abilities upon reaching the specified [[experience level]]:

*XL 1: [[Stealth]]
*XL 1: [[Speed]]
*XL 10: [[Automatic searching|Searching]]

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Archeologists now start with searching but not stealth and speed.  Stealth is gained at XL 5, speed at XL 10, since {{commit|075c2832a1145ff3dc0049f2cfa6f3b86352179e}}}}

== Skills ==
{{Archeologist skill table}}

Archeologists start with ''Basic'' skill in the categories ''[[Bullwhip|Whip]]'' and ''[[Pick-axe]]''.

==Special rules==

Archeologists can use uncursed [[touchstone]]s as if they were blessed, formally identifying the type of any gem.

Archeologists suffer a &minus;1 alignment penalty for breaking a [[historic statue]].

Non-chaotic archeologists suffer a &minus;3 alignment penalty for digging up a [[headstone]]; chaotic archeologists get a +3 alignment bonus.

==Strategy==
=== Character creation ===
An Archeologist is likely to want to enter the [[Gnomish Mines]] early for gems and better gear; this is risky for a human due to their lack of [[infravision]] and predominance of hostile inhabitants. A dwarven Archeologist's [[HP]] bonus makes their poor starting armor more bearable; conversely, a gnome's poor HP makes them more prone to death in the early game. However, a dwarf's [[energy]] growth penalty can make [[spellcasting]] difficult or impossible in the late game.

Archaeologists are restricted in most of the strong one-handed weapon skills, so the deterministic nature of lawful [[sacrifice gift]]s can be an advantage. Your first gift will be either [[Grayswandir]] or an artifact [[long sword]]; in the latter case, your long sword skill is unrestricted, and you can dip another long sword for [[Excalibur]]. In either case, you're guaranteed a strong artifact weapon that can carry you through the game. Neutral sacrifice gifts are less reliable, and each has a disadvantage.

=== Early game ===
==== Objectives ====
The early game must be played cautiously, like the [[Tourist]] and [[Healer]]. Archeologist is considered one of the more difficult roles, as its starting resources don't contribute as much to survival as those of most other roles, so the Archeologist is more reliant on items they find.

Your starting touchstone can make the first few floors of the Mines very profitable. Your starting [[pick-axe]] can also be used to dig out gold, gems, and [[vault]]s in the early levels, and dig down through floors. Thus, you can accumulate a lot of wealth in just the first few floors of the dungeon and mines.  Your [[sack]] can then help multiply it via [[credit cloning]].  This makes buying [[protection]] from [[Minetown]] doable, even if you gain a few levels on the way. If you do make it to Minetown at level 1, you should be able to buy protection several times.

The advantages of the Mines mean that it should be pursued before [[Sokoban]]. Continuing to [[Mines' End]] is very risky; although the [[luckstone]] and random tools can be useful to you, monster generation is difficult enough that you're not likely to survive as you are. Make sure to complete it eventually, though.

Sokoban can be a good choice afterward, because you can use your starting pickaxe to break boulders if need be, and your sack can store the food and items that are plentiful there. It's also good for exercising your low starting [[strength]].

[[Luck]] is very important early in the game, so save at least one cheap gem to throw to a co-aligned [[unicorn]]. Because throwing an identified precious gem gives a +5 boost to Luck, consider doing it even before you find a [[luckstone]].

Since you start with intrinsic speed, [[invisibility]] is a highly desirable quality for avoiding monsters. A fast, invisible, opponent is hard to chase down. Stealth is also helpful for clearing out [[treasure zoo|treasure zoos]] and [[throne room|throne rooms]], as it leaves enemies sleeping.

==== Weapons ====
Your starting bullwhip and pick-axe are about equally poor weapons, but only the latter allows you to gain [[skill]] in preparation for wielding a [[dwarvish mattock]] later, making it the preferable choice. If you want to use the bullwhip for its +2 enchantment bonus, be aware of which monsters are [[thick-skinned]]; the bullwhip is impotent against them. The bullwhip can be used to disarm weapon-wielding monsters, although it's generally faster just to kill them outright.

Archeologists suffer from a lack of good ranged weapon options; boomerangs are rare and have an unwieldy flight path, rocks are heavy and very weak even with a sling, and daggers and darts are limited to Basic skill, so you can't [[multishot]] them. The [[aklys]] is probably the best early-game option; you can pick one up easily in the Mines, advance its skill to Skilled for a substantial to-hit bonus, and it usually returns to your hand, so you only need to carry one or two rather than a heavy stack of rocks or daggers.

=== Mid game ===
==== Objectives ====
Archeologists should have [[poison resistance]] by the time they attempt the Quest, which is full of poisonous snakes. The starting tinning kit is very helpful, allowing you to safely eat poisonous corpses for the chance of the intrinsic.

The locate level of the contains three altars, one of each alignment; this guarantees a co-aligned altar may be a good place to wait and sacrifice monsters if you haven't found an artifact weapon yet.

Archeologists planning to use [[The Orb of Detection]] as a source of magic resistance should have a reliable backup source, such as [[Magicbane]], [[gray dragon scale mail]] or a [[cloak of magic resistance]], in case the [[Wizard of Yendor]] steals it or else the player decides to stash it to prevent theft.

==== Weapons ====
Because you start with low physical stats and melee penalties, acquiring an artifact weapon is a central concern. It's not a bad idea to camp on an altar you find and [[sacrifice]] for a gift. Archeologists have good artifact weapon possibilities, such as [[Grayswandir]], [[Mjollnir]], [[Vorpal Blade]], and [[Magicbane]]. Lawful players can also dip for [[Excalibur]] if they find a long sword (though it will not be unrestricted unless you have had another long sword gifted to you).

Dwarvish mattocks and [[silver saber]]s are good non-artifact weapons, and one or the other should be trained to Expert. If you are planning to get Grayswandir or at least two-weapon with a silver saber, you should begin training saber skill as soon as you find one. The [[watch captain]] in [[Minetown]] often carries one, so consider getting a pet to kill him for it. If you disarm him with your whip, it will anger him but not the other guards.  Remember that if you only plan to use a saber while dual-wielding, you don't need to advance the saber skill past Basic, as Skilled [[two-weapon combat]] is unreachable for Archeologists.

==== Spellcasting ====
As you progress through the game and level up, spellcasting becomes more of an option. Your high starting intelligence makes you good at reading spellbooks without needing to bless them. You can become proficient in several spell schools, meaning that you can become competent at casting many low-level spells. However, armor usually remains more important than spells through the early and mid game. Don't ditch good metal armor in favor of spellcasting until you're confident you can survive without it.

=== Late game ===
==== Weapons ====
For Archeologists, the best strategy is to find a good artifact weapon, enchant it up, and stick with it through the rest of the game. Two-weaponing is reliable because your experience level and Luck at this point completely cancel out the the −7 to-hit penalty.

The best [[artifact]] weapon for you is [[Grayswandir]], which does double damage and [[silver damage]]. It is one of the few artifact weapons you can advance to Expert. The neutral artifact weapons for Archeologists are quite good as well, but Grayswandir is so excellent that you might want to consider wishing for it even if you're neutral.

==== Spellcasting ====
In the mid-game and beyond, you may want to advance divination spells to Skilled for casting [[magic mapping]], which is your [[special spell]] and can be greatly useful in Gehennom. {{spell of|Detect treasure}} and {{spell of|detect unseen}} are also nice to have, and [[identify]] is always useful. [[Divination spells#Strategy|Don't advance them to Expert unless you really need your failure rates to be lower.]]

Since most of your useful spells are utility spells, it isn't necessary to avoid metal armor.

==Rank titles==

The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1–2: Digger
*XL 3–5: Field Worker
*XL 6–9: Investigator
*XL 10–13: Exhumer
*XL 14–17: Excavator
*XL 18–21: Spelunker
*XL 22–25: Speleologist
*XL 26–29: Collector
*XL 30: Curator

==Quest==

{{main|Archeologist quest}}

The Archeologist quest artifact is [[the Orb of Detection]], a [[crystal ball]]. When carried, it confers [[magic resistance]], [[telepathy]] and half damage when attacked by spells. When #[[invoke]]d, it toggles [[invisibility]] on/off.

== Variants ==
=== Itlachiayaque ===
{{main|Itlachiayaque}}
In [[UnNetHack]], [[dNetHack]], [[NetHack Fourk]], [[SlashTHEM]], and [[xNetHack]], the Orb of Detection is replaced as the quest artifact by [[Itlachiayaque]], an artifact [[shield of reflection]]. Itlachiayaque confers [[fire resistance]] when carried and can be [[invoke]]d to produce a poison cloud (similar to a [[scroll of stinking cloud]]. In xNetHack, it also confers [[warning]], and the player can additionally choose to use it as a [[crystal ball]] when invoking it. In the other variants, it confers [[telepathy]] and [[half spell damage]] when carried.

=== SLASH'EM ===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Archeologists may be [[Doppelganger (starting race)|doppelgangers]], [[Elf (starting race)|elves]], or [[Hobbit (starting race)|hobbits]] in addition to the vanilla combinations. All Archeologists can use the [[research]] [[technique]] at level 1.

The starting equipment has also changed: Archeologists begin with a spellbook, one of {{Spell of|detect food}}, {{Spell of|detect monsters}}, {{Spell of|light}}, {{Spell of|knock}}, or {{Spell of|wizard lock}}, 2 random scrolls, a 25% chance of a blindfold, a 25% chance of a towel if they did not get a blindfold, 25% chance of a leash, a 25% chance of a tin opener or a 25% chance of either an oil lamp or a torch if they did not get the tin opener, and a 12.5% chance of a magic marker. The [[fedora]] gives +1 charisma and acts as a luckstone for Archeologists when worn.

=== UnNetHack ===
[[UnNetHack]] allows Archeologists to safely enchant a fedora past +5 up to +7, and they gain a +2 bonus to Luck when wearing one.

=== FIQHack ===
In [[FIQHack]], archeologists get a +10 bonus to the base searching rate.<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/33e95f977761f66186a1f9aea1ca5e5d262912a2/libnethack/src/detect.c#L1321</ref>

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|

&&%s&& %s Extinctionism {144441 2022-02-10T23:53:23Z {4001381 Qt} /* Monsters not subject to extinction */ undead turning does not increment the born counter, and there was some odd/misplaced strategy advice in 'monsters not subject to extinction' '''Extinction''' is the condition whereby a particular kind of [[monster]] can no longer be (normally) generated after 120 of its kind have been generated.

'''Extinctionism''' is the [[unofficial conduct|challenge]] to cause every possible monster in a game of [[NetHack]] to become extinct. Once a species has become extinct, there are very few ways to create new monsters of that species. There are some exceptions, however, such as the [[monster spell]] [[summon nasties]].

Extinction is distinct from [[genocide]], which must be deliberately invoked and has no exceptions.

== How creatures become extinct ==

A creature is extinct when 120 of its kind are generated.  The creatures do not have to be killed to be extinct.  Once extinct, a creature will never be randomly generated again.

For example, you can make a creature extinct simply by summoning, or [[reverse genocide|reverse-genociding]] 120 of its kind (which can be expected to take approximately 24 cursed genocide scrolls, given that each scroll summons 4-6 individuals), with no requirement to kill the summoned creatures.

As exceptions to the normal rule, [[erinyes]] become extinct after three are generated, and [[Nazgul]] after nine are generated. Extinction of these species is more thorough; even methods that ignore or only partially respect it will not generate them.

To make a creature extinct, you must create it in a way that increments the "born" counter.

Mechanisms of monster creation can be classified in those that
* respect extinction and increment the born counter (examples: normal random generation; create monster spells; etc)
* respect extinction but do not increment the born counter (example: pudding division)
* do not respect extinction, but do increment the born counter (examples: Summon Nasties; Quest-specific monster generation in the Quest)
* neither respect extinction nor increment the born counter (example: troll regeneration).

== Actions that respect extinction ==

* [[Reverse genocide|Reverse-genociding]] a monster.
* Casting [[create monster]] via [[spell]], [[scroll]] or [[wand]].
* Waiting around on a level for it to be randomly generated.
* Entering a level containing a special room such as a [[zoo]], or [[beehive]].
* [[Black pudding]]s summoned by [[kick]]ing a [[sink]]{{refsrc|dokick.c|956}}.
* [[Division]] of [[pudding]]s and [[gremlin]]s
* Applying a [[bag of tricks]]
* Stepping on a [[magic trap]]
* [[Special level]]s which place monsters of a specific [[monster class]].

Pudding and gremlin division does not increment the born counter but respects extinction. You cannot make puddings extinct by dividing them, but once they have been made extinct by other means, puddings will no longer divide.{{refsrc|makemon.c|679}}

== Actions that sometimes respect extinction ==
*[[Throne room]]s, and sitting on/confusedly looting [[throne]]s.
**[[Bugbear]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s may be created even if extinct.
*[[Graveyard]]s and reading the cursed [[Book of the Dead]].
**[[Master lich]]es, [[nalfeshnee]]s, [[ghost]]s, and [[wraith]]s can always be generated.
*[[Anthole]]s.
**If every species of [[ant]] is extinct, ants will be replaced by random monsters which can include extinct species.
*[[Shrieker]] summoning.
**[[Purple worm]]s will not respect extinction if explicitly rolled. If they are selected as part of a random monster roll, on the other hand, they ''will'' respect extinction.
*Demon summoning
**Only unique demons will respect extinction when generated by this method.
*[[Spider web]]s
**Spider webs generated as dungeon features will not respect extinction, and will always have a spider under them.

== Actions that do not respect extinction ==

* Bees in a [[beehive]] (queen bees, killer bees)
* [[Cockatrice nest]]s
* [[Leprechaun hall]]s
* [[Summon nasties]] monster spell
* [[Troll]] regeneration (does not increment the born counter)
* [[Scroll of create monster]] while confused (acid blobs)
* [[Keystone Kop]]s summoned when you've [[Stealing from shops|stolen from a shop]]<ref>There is code to make them extinct {{sourcecode|shk.c|3435}}, but wizard mode testing confirms you can have as many Kops as you like.  This is because {{function|makemon.c|propagate}} never marks non-randomly-generated (G_NOGEN) monsters such as Kops as extinct.</ref>
* [[Quest]] themed monsters when replacing ordinary random monster generation in that dungeon branch
* [[Golem]]s created from polypiling
* [[Figurine]]s
* Special levels which place monsters of a specific species.

== Monsters not subject to extinction ==

Because the most common methods of extinctionism rely on monster generation, [[Unique monster|unique monsters]] are ignored by some extinctionists. However, unstoning a statue of a monster will increase the monster count for purposes of extinction; as a result, even unique monsters can be made extinct in this sense. Note that unlike unstoning a monster, [[revive|reviving]] a corpse does not increment the born count of the monster; since extinction is based on the number of monsters 'born' rather than the number killed, the method of revival rather than the method of killing is the determining factor.

[[Keystone Kop]]s do not become extinct even after 120 of each kind have been created.

== Play styles for an extinctionist ==
[[Image:Extin.png|thumb|right|300px|Extinctionist wizard has filled an entire [[dungeon level|level]] with monsters by repeatedly casting {{Spell of|create monster}}.]]
The easiest way to play an extinctionist is to play as a [[wizard]].  Wizards have the ability to cast [[create monster]] with no hunger penalty, and with the [[Eye of the Aethiopica]] they can cast virtually indefinitely.  There is no reason another class couldn't do extinctionism; it would simply be more challenging.

An alternative to [[Eye of the Aethiopica|the Eye]] is [[throne farming|confused throne looting]]. Once extinct, the typical throne room population is replaced by ordinary random monster creation. You can generate as many monsters as you like, for free, at any rate you like, without even breaking conducts. However, killing the monsters is slower due to confusion, so several strong pets might be a good plan. The drawback is pet kills will not generate [[death drop]]s.

Most extinctionists play through the early- to mid-game as normal, then start working on eliminating monster species after becoming strong enough to do so safely. "Strong enough" in this case typically means obtaining the Eye, sporting a decent set of armor and a good weapon, and gathering up all the various resistances, including [[magic resistance]], and [[reflection]].  It would be very bad to lose your character to a random [[Gnome With The Wand Of Death|gnome with a wand of death]] after hours of painstaking and tedious summoning.

A common method to rack up kills is to build a [[boulder fort]] around an [[altar]].  Then stand behind the altar and cast create monster over and over, while killing the resulting monsters and sacrificing them to your god.

You can either just summon monsters and kill them at random, or try to control your summoning.

Controlling your summoning can be done by carefully regulating your own [[experience level]] (either by foregoing experience gain by letting pets and/or conflict take care of kills, or by casting [[drain life]] on yourself when required), and picking which [[dungeon level]] to summon the monsters on.  By keeping your experience level low and staying on a low-numbered dungeon level, you force the game to only summon monsters of a particular [[difficulty]] or lower.  In this way you can wipe out all the lower-level monsters, casting and killing until create monster fails.  You can then move down one or two dungeon levels, gain one or two experience levels, OR move down one dungeon level and gain one experience level -- any of those effects will increase the difficulty of available monsters by one (since monsters are generated of difficulty not exceeding to the average of your dungeon level and experience level).

This controlled summoning method could also be used from the beginning of the game, before acquiring the quest artifact and key resistances, although as noted above this method is somewhat more fraught with danger.

== Special cases ==

[[erinys|Erinyes]] become extinct after 3 have been created and [[Nazgul]] become extinct after 9 have been created, as would be expected based on their respective sources (although not all authors held the [[Wikipedia:Erinyes|Erinyes]] to number three).

== Strategy ==

A basic use of a boulder fort is as a protection or escape tactic. You can read a blessed [[scroll of earth]] if an arch-lich is summoning too many monsters, or you can take out difficult monsters such as [[quest nemeses]] from behind a strategic boulder fort on the stairs up.

You can [[Aligned priest#Trapping an aligned priest with boulders|trap a temple priest in a boulder fort]] in order to convert the altar without interference.

Boulder forts are useful for [[extinctionism]] or [[farming]], because they can force monsters to be created on (and able to attack you from) a certain spot, such as an [[altar]]. The keystroke sequence necessary for mass monster slaying becomes rather simple and less [[paste|error-prone]] in a fort.

 .....

Boulder forts are vulnerable to hostile monsters zapping [[wand of striking|wands of striking]] at you from outside and smashing the boulders. [[Ghost]]s, [[giants]], and [[xorns]] can also move onto squares containing boulders. However, monsters cannot occupy the same square as one another, so for better security, some players opt for a '''boulder-jelly fort''': a fort where the boulders sit on top of [[Blue jelly|blue jellies]] (or other [[sessile]] monsters), which never move. This is still not foolproof, but it is pretty solid. For maximum (but still not foolproof) security, you may want to make a boulder-jelly fort where each jelly is sitting on a [[scroll of scare monster]].

&&%s&& %s Score {142152 2021-08-22T18:16:55Z {4001483 Cathartes} /* How to maximize score */ rename section to /* Score value of items */ because it doesn't effectively describe how to maximize score and is more about the items. "how to maximize score" is probably actually "kill lots of high level monsters" '''Score''' is calculated all throughout the game, and if you have the '''showscore''' setting in your [[options|rcfile]], you can see it on the bottom line at all times. Score also decides if the game considers your character a [[beginner]], receiving less information (a "strange feeling" message) when use-testing things.

Low-score ascensions are generally more prestigious because you got the job done with less effort, although [[tournament]]s frequently have awards for both the lowest-scoring and the highest-scoring ascensions.

==How score is calculated==
The following things contribute to your score:

* Killing a monster &mdash; worth 4 times the monster's [[experience points#Experience points from killing monsters|experience points]]
* Identifying a [[wand]] by [[engraving]] or [[zap]]ping &mdash; 10 points
** Non-directional wands always give score
** [[Ray]]-type wands give score if zapped in any direction except yourself, or if engraved with
** Beam/immediate-type wands give score if zapped up or down, but not in other directions or at a monster engulfing you
** Breaking wands never gives score
* Identifying a [[potion]] by [[quaffing]] &mdash; 10 points
** [[apply|Lighting]] a potion of oil identifies it without giving points
* Identifying a [[scroll]] by [[read]]ing &mdash; 10 points
* [[potion of oil|Oiling]] or [[can of grease|greasing]] a [[squeaky board]] [[trap]] &mdash; 9 points
* Eating a [[tripe ration]] when not an [[orc (starting race)|orc]] or carnivorous non-humanoid &mdash; 4 points
* Quaffing from a sink and getting the message "Yuk, this water tastes awful" &mdash; 4 points
* Reading your first [[novel]] &mdash; 80 points

The first [[oracle]] of each type:

* Minor (if not yet major): 21 points
* Minor (if already major): 9 points
* Major (if not yet minor): 210 + (21 * XL) points
* Major (if already minor): 90 + (9 * XL) points

At the end of the game (via death, ascension or escape):

* 1 point for each zorkmid more than starting gold (* 90% if game ended in death)
* 50 * (DL-1) points where DL is the deepest level reached
* 1000 points for each dungeon level reached beyond 20, to a maximum of 10000 points

If you ascended with your starting [[alignment]], your score so far is multiplied by 2 if you have not permanently converted yourself, or 1.5 if you have (and changed back using a [[helm of opposite alignment]]) {{refsrc|src/end.c|1244|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}. Then, if you [[escaping the dungeon|escaped the dungeon]] or ascended, you receive points for items in inventory:

* Value of [[amulet]]s and valuable [[gem]]s
* Value of [[artifact]]s * 2.5, including [[invocation]] items

And finally points for adjacent pets equivalent to their total current hit points.

The lowest possible score one can achieve when [[ascension|ascending]] is 24400,<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_frm/thread/d2ed054d48f4961c</ref> although this depends on the [[Sanctum]]'s depth (see below for details).

==How to minimize score==
Ascending with the minimum possible score is one of the more difficult [[unofficial conduct]]s. [[Unofficial conduct#Minimum score|A few people have succeeded at this]].

* Play as a '''[[pacifist]]'''. Good choices are gnomish [[healer]]s and elven [[wizard]]s because of their starting inventories.
* '''Levelling up''': Quaff a [[potion of gain level]] to reach XL 2, at which point it is safe to dally with a [[foocubus]].  You will have to formally identify this potion, or see a monster using a non-cursed one, to avoid getting "bonus" score. If you can get one, a wraith corpse is also a viable method of getting to XL 2. Make sure you have an identified, [[potion of full healing|blessed potion of full healing]] in case you get level drained by a [[foocubus]].  As of [[3.6.1]], a non-cursed [[potion of restore ability]] can also restore a lost level, and will not auto-identify.
** Do not consult the [[Oracle]] to level up.
** Do not #[[untrap]] any [[trap#Squeaky board|squeaky board traps]], eat [[tripe ration]]s, or quaff from [[sink]]s to regain a single experience points, as this gives score. Kicking, and digging on sinks is okay.
* Formally '''identify''' [[wand]]s, [[scroll]]s and [[potion]]s before use.
** Dipping into (un)holy water does not formally identify it, so feel free to bless and curse items as you would usually.  Quaffing an uncursed potion of water will give points, however, and must be avoided. Dipping into uncursed potions of water only identifies the potion if it is used up in the process; it is probably best to avoid doing this.
** Ideally, obtain a [[spellbook of identify]] from a [[wish]], [[prayer]], [[magic marker]], [[polypiling]], starting inventory, or random loot. (47% of all dungeons have one in the Mines or above [[medusa level|Medusa]]. Break the [[Oracle]] statues with a [[pick-axe]] or a [[wand of striking]].)
** Finding and identifying a wand of polymorph is the bottleneck if you don't get a spellbook of identify. [[aligned priest|Temple priests]] often have the books to polypile. See below.
** Get a ''[[robe]]'' from a [[aligned priest|priest]] to cast {{spell of|identify}} reliably. [[Magic resistance]] should come from [[gray dragon scale mail|other]] [[artifact|sources]]. Wizards can use their starting cloak.
** Your backup is the the [[scroll of identify]]. [[Price identification|Price-ID]] it, then formally identify it on a [[throne]]. Your [[Quest#Quest leaders and nemeses|quest leader]] often sits on a throne. Find and bless as many ID scrolls as possible to mass-identify wands, scrolls and potions before use.
* '''Scrolls''': Price-ID scrolls as you find them. Most will be no use to you until you have a source of identification.  It is likely that monsters will identify the [[scroll of teleportation]] and [[scroll of create monster]] for you relatively early, after which they can be used as needed.
** 80zm scrolls are of most interest here: the [[scroll of remove curse]] will never self-identify on use, and is safe to use.  The other 80zm scroll, [[scroll of enchant armor|enchant armor,]] will not self-identify if you are naked, or wearing only [[dragon scales]].<ref group=note>Even if the scroll is blessed, reading an enchant armor scroll will never identify it when used on dragon scales even though the enchantment of the resulting DSM is raised.</ref> If you have only one scroll, remember to remove any #name from the scroll before reading to be prompted to re-name it after it has been used up. This may use up a potentially valuable scroll for no benefit though (unless you possess scales you want to turn into DSM), and still does not give you access to armor enchantment, so is only worthwhile if you have a lot of loot, or a [[bag of holding|critical item]], to uncurse. Alternatively, get a magic marker, #name both 80zm scrolls and write either scroll: this will let you tell the two scrolls apart.
** The only non-blank 60zm scroll, [[scroll of enchant weapon|enchant weapon]] can also be determined, and safely be used on any weapon whose enchantment is not formally known (e.g. before giving the weapon to a pet).
** In a pinch, certain scrolls will not self-identify when read while confused. Thus, if you can be sure that a scroll is a [[scroll of gold detection]] it can be read while confused to, e.g., pinpoint a suspected polytrap.
* '''Wands''': You have to rule out the non-directional wands ([[wand of light|light]], [[Wand of secret door detection|secret door]], [[Wand of enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[Wand of create monster|create monster]], [[Wand of wishing|wishing]]) before there are ways to test them without bonus score. Don't [[engrave]] until you have additionally identified [[wand of fire|fire]], [[wand of lightning|lightning]], and [[wand of digging|digging]].
** Early intrinsic speed is a valuable trait, and [[wand of speed monster|the wand]] does not give points on formal identification if you zap yourself.
** 500zm wands need formal identification.
** 200zm wands: [[wand of polymorph|Polymorph]] is the prize. After monsters identify the [[wand of create monster]] for you,<ref group=note>Alternatively, zap if you are blind and non-telepathic.</ref> you can engrave with these. You can formally identify a wand of polymorph by zapping at yourself (preferably with [[ring of polymorph control|polymorph control]]), or at an engulfing monster while you are engulfed. Alternatively, give it to a wand-using monster of difficulty less than 5; it will eventually use-identify it for you. Unlike [[polymorph trap]]s, you do not risk out-of-depth monsters.
** 175zm wands: If you spend a long time with no source of identification, but have [[reflection]], you may want to let monsters zap [[price identification|175zm]] [[wand|wands]] at you; hopefully this will give access to a source of permanent engraving. Zapping yourself ignores reflection, and is less preferable until you have all the necessary resistances or can withstand the damage and other effects.
** 150zm wands are not usually worth sorting through because the [[wand of enlightenment]] will auto-identify on engraving, and monsters will neither use it nor be generated carrying it. Nevertheless, having monsters formally identify wands of [[wand of striking|striking]] and [[wand of digging|digging]] for you is a bonus. [[Shopkeeper]]s will often have [[Wand of striking|striking]] and [[Wand of magic missile|magic missile]] on their person, which do not give points on self-zapping. But use price-ID in another shop to exclude [[wand of death|death]] and attack wands you cannot yet survive.
* '''Potions''': Do not #dip into potions without price identifying them first, because you may formally identify the [[potion of polymorph]] inadvertently.
** 50zm: If you (and all monsters around you) are not [[invisibility|invisible]], it is possible to safely quaff 50zm potions after you rule out the [[potion of sickness]] by [[dip#Dipping_Examples|#dipping]] a dart, arrow or [[unicorn horn]] into it. You can either bless and quaff one of each of the others, or use a [[delicatessen]] to determine which potion is [[potion of see invisible|see invisible]]. This is arguably a better way of obtaining this intrinsic than quaffing from [[fountain]]s or waiting until you are deep enough for [[stalker]]s to be generated.
** 100zm: Once you have identified [[potion of healing|healing]] and [[potion of extra healing|extra healing]] by monster use, starting as a healer, etc., you may want to dilute any further 100zm potions. These tend to be junk. However, the 100zm [[potion of restore ability|restore ability]] does not formally identify and can be quaffed once you can tell which it is by process of elimination. This can be useful before you find a [[unicorn horn]] or if the potion of restore ability is a [[smoky and milky potions|smoky potion]].
* Do not ascend with your starting '''alignment'''.  You can either [[Sacrifice#Cross-aligned_altars|convert yourself]] in advance or use a [[helm of opposite alignment]] right before offering the Amulet.
* Before offering the '''Amulet of Yendor''', drop all gold, valuable gems, amulets and artifacts. When you do offer it, make sure any pets are not next to you.

The minimum possible score for an ascension is dependent on the depth of [[Moloch's Sanctum]] in the game:

Yeti [https://voyager.lupomesky.cz/nh/devnull/2014/ ascended with 24400 points] during the 2014 [[Devnull]] tournament.

==Score value of items==
Certain things are worth more than others when completing the game. When the player ascends, his base score is doubled.  Because gold is part of this base score, each gold piece is essentially worth two points. Gold has a weight of one unit per 100 pieces. This means that 100 gold, or 200 points weighs one unit, which is the same weight as the least valuable [[gem]].

Each [[amulet]] weighs twenty units and, except for the [[cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor]], is worth 150 zorkmids. This makes each amulet worth far less than its weight in gold.

It is possible to achieve extremely high score (MAXINT on 64-bit platform) by exploiting [[Bugs_in_NetHack_3.4.3#SC343-8|bug SC343-8]] - "Re-animating a statue containing gold produces too much gold.", as it allows duplicating for an effectively infinite amount of gold.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/nethack/comments/1d6fwe/im_asking_feedback_for_the_upcoming_junethack/c9no05r</ref> Berry [https://junethack.de/archive/2012/user/Berry.html ascended with 9223372036854775807 points] during [[Junethack]] tournament.

===Artifacts===
Artifacts weigh more than one unit, so depending on their value, they may or may not be worth more than an equivalent weight in gold. The following chart lists the value of each artifact, its weight, and its value/weight. If the value/weight column is not at least 200, the artifact is worth less than its weight in gold, and, for score purposes, you would be better off carrying gold than that artifact into the [[End Game]].
