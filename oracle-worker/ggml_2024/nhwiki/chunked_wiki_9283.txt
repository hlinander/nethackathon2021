'''Apocalypse angels''' are a possible inhabitant of an angel-[[hellish seal]]. They are notable for the variety of status ailments they can inflict through their [[insight]]- and [[sanity]]-dependent attack and for the large numbers of allies.

Apocalypse angels have a 2 square snakebite attack and a close range "prophecy" attack. They also summon aid all over the current dungeon level.

== Revelatory whispers ==

The attacker will "whisper terrible truths" in the target's ear. Against the PC, this will lift the [[Insight#The_Veil|veil]] (if not already lifted) and has an [[insight]]-dependent chance of further effects. A random number from 0 to your Insight-1 is rolled, and if this number is >= 10 the attack takes effect. If not, you become confused and your insight increases by 1, but no further effects occur.

=== Effects ===

For Number equal to 1 per 5 points of sanity that you've lost, or 1d(attacker level) vs monsters:

{|class="prettytable"
!Message
!Effect
|-
|Doubt clouds your heart.
|Makes the target [[Doubt]]ful. The PCs doubt timer will be set to 50xNumber (more) turns.
|-
|Blasphemous thoughts fill your mind!
|Increases the [[anger]] of a random god by 1, and lets the god [[smite]] the PC. Monsters may be struck by lightning or disintegrated.
|-
|The truth shakes the foundations of your mind!
|Lose some [[sanity]] points. This sanity loss may inflict a temporary madness. Monsters are instead stunned and confused.
|-
|The truth tears down the foundations of your mind!
|The PC loses one point of wisdom and 10% of memories per point of Number. If wisdom is reduced to minimum the PC will tear at themselves in horror, taking (Number)d10 direct damage. Monsters take (Number)d10 damage.
|-
|[The angel] shares a prophecy of doom!
|The target's [[morale]] is lowered by Number points, and [[study]] is increased by a like amount.
|-
|[Variable]
|The angel uses a [[rider]] touch attack vs. the target.
|-
|[The angel] shares a prophecy of your death!
|Your intrinsic AC bonus and divine protection bonus are both reduced by Number points. Monsters instead have their morale reduced.
|-
|[The angel] shares a prophecy of great misfortune!
|Your [[luck]] is reduced by Number points. Monsters instead have their morale reduced.
|-
|Space bleeds around [target].
|The target's inventory is soaked with blood, cursing and water damaging random items.
|}

== Prophecy summons ==

Summons between 0 and 33 (1 per 3 points of sanity lost) invidiaks, fallen coure eladrins, walking deliriums, or earth elementals for 66 turns. After 66 turns, a new batch can be summoned.

==Origin==

Unsurprisingly, apocalypse angels are (very loosely) based on the Book of Revelation (Apok√°lypsis).

'''Harrowers of Zariel''' are a possible inhabitant of an angel-[[hellish seal]]. They are notable for summoning massive numbers of dangerous shades.

== Harrower of Zariel ==

As enemies, Harrowers are not able to use their melee attacks or move around. To defeat them, the player must avoid or destroy the summoned shades and kill the Harrower.

=== Summon shades ===

Once per seven turns, a harrower can summon between 2 and 6 (2d3) Zarielite shades. These shades are extremely dangerous:

* They can only be damaged by weapons with the opposite beatitude. Zealots carry holy gear and can only be harmed by cursed weapons, while heretics carry unholy gear and can only be harmed by blessed weapons.
* Their weapons are heavily enchanted, they swing twice per move, and they get 1.5 turns per move, giving them respectable damage output.
* They wear enchanted armor, making them somewhat difficult to hit even with weapons of the appropriate beatitude.

A circle of Acheron ward is suggested to avoid being overwhelmed.

An '''amulet of magic resistance''' is a type of [[amulet]] that appears in [[SlashTHEM]] and [[EvilHack]]. It grants [[magic resistance]] while worn, and its default material is [[iron]], like all amulets.

The default [[randomized appearance]] associated with it in SlashTHEM is a rare amulet.<ref>[https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/v0.9.6/src/objects.c#L847 SlashTHEM 0.9.6 objects.c, line 847]</ref> In EvilHack, the default random appearance is an oblong amulet.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/objects.c#L665 EvilHack 0.7 objects.c, line 665]</ref>

==Generation==
The amulet of magic resistance appears in different places dependent on the variant.

===EvilHack===
[[Giant (starting race)|Giant]] [[Wizard]]s start the game with an amulet of magic resistance, technically their equivalent to the role's standard [[cloak of magic resistance]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/u_init.c#L222 EvilHack 0.7 u_init.c, line 222]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/u_init.c#L266 EvilHack 0.7 u_init.c, line 266]</ref>

The [[Sokoban]] prize amulet has an equal chance to be an amulet of magic resistance or an [[amulet of reflection]].

[[Racial monster|Giant]] [[aligned priest]]s have a {{frac|1|21}} chance to generate wearing an amulet of magic resistance, the same as the chance for other aligned priests to generate with a cloak of magic resistance.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L1867 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 1867]</ref> Giant [[Wizard (player monster)|wizard]] [[player monster]]s will generate with an amulet of magic resistance, and other player monsters created at level 20 or higher may generate with an amulet of magic resistance.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L307 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 307]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L843 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 843]</ref> The [[Wizard of Yendor]] has a 50% chance to generate with an amulet of magic resistance.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L1237 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 1237]</ref>

==Strategy==
===EvilHack===
Amulets of magic resistance allow for more flexibility in most players' choice of armor, especially for [[ascension kit]]s - it is of particular importance to giants, whose choices are limited to either the amulet or a [[artifact]] that must be carried or wielded.

&&%s&& %s Sling bullet {145444 2022-04-12T12:55:27Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* EvilHack */ Specific version links A '''sling bullet''' is a [[defunct]] object that formerly appeared in ''[[NetHack]]'' until version [[3.0.0]], and was used as ammunition for [[slings]]. Sling bullets dealt 1d6 + 1 damage versus small monsters, and 1d4 + 1 versus large monsters, the same as [[crossbow bolts]].{{refsrc|fight.c|337|version=NetHack 2.3e}}{{refsrc|fight.c|362|version=NetHack 2.3e}}

==History==
The early versions of hack121 and PDP-11, variants of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]], used various types of sling bullets - interestingly, [[rock]]s did not exist as objects until the first version of [[Andries Brouwer]]'s [[Hack 1.0|Hack]]. From these versions to [[Hack 1.0.3]], sling bullets had their base damage values against large and small monsters reversed.<ref>[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/games/hack/1.0.2-part1 Hack 1.0.2 partl] (objects.h, line 620), Andries Brouwer @ cwi.nl</ref> As the weapons and armor are derived from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', this reversal was likely unintentional - [[NetHack 1.3d]] sets the damage values to match that of the source material.

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Sling (weapon)}}
[[File:Sling_bullets_clay_and_stone.JPG|thumb|200px|Bullets of clay and stone]]
Sling bullets and their damage values are derived from the Advanced Edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', where they dealt ''1d4'' base damage.<ref>http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Sling</ref>

As the sling is a widespread weapon dating back to Neolithic cultures (if not still-older ones), sling-bullets and similar objects used as sling ammunition are common archeological finds. The size of a sling-bullet varies greatly from no larger than a mere pebble to fist-sized stones weighing a pound or more, and in the hands of a skilled slinger could be hurled upwards of 450 meters (1500 feet) at speeds over 250 miles per hour.<ref>http://www.slinging.org/</ref>

Rocks used as sling ammunition are frequently salvaged from river depths, where the rushing water would slowly shape the stone round. Bullets are also purpose-made from various materials such as clay - in Classical times, lead-cast bullets were considered the most efficient and best-quality ammunition. Symbols such as stylized lightning bolts, snakes and scorpions have often been found molded into lead sling-bullets from around this time; others have had holes drilled into them that produce a whooshing sound in flight. Slinging as a sport is still practiced in the Balearic Islands (where slinging is a tradition) and elsewhere, and slings also see use as weapons for hobby purposes.

==EvilHack==
Sling bullets return as items in the variant [[EvilHack]], introduced in version 0.7.1. Their default material is [[iron]], and they appear as '''shiny stones''' when unidentified. [[Cavemen|Cavepeople]] of all types can start with sling bullets.

[[Hobbit]]s and [[hobbit pickpocket]]s [[monster starting inventory|generated with a]] [[sling]] have a {{frac|3}} chance to carry 5-10 sling bullets, while [[Caveman (player monster)|caveperson]] [[player monster]]s will also generate with sling bullets.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/v0.7.1/src/makemon.c#L1291 EvilHack 0.7.1 makemon.c, line 1291]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/v0.7.1/src/makemon.c#L267 EvilHack 0.7.1 makemon.c, line 267]</ref>

'''Gauntlets of protection''' are [[gloves]] that appear in [[EvilHack]].

==Generation==
[[Giant (starting race)|Giant]] [[Infidel]]s start the game with [[cursed]] [[fireproof]] +0 gauntlets of protection, roughly equivalent to the role's standard [[cloak of protection]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/u_init.c#L270 EvilHack 0.7 u_init.c, line 270]</ref>

The [[Sokoban]] prize armor has an equal chance to be gauntlets of protection or a [[helm of speed]].

[[Racial monster|Giant]] [[aligned priest]]s have a {{frac|2|21}} chance to generate wearing gauntlets of protection, the same as the chance for other aligned priests to generate with a cloak of protection.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L1866 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 1866]</ref> Giant [[Infidel (player monster)|Infidel]] [[player monster]]s will generate with gauntlets of protection, and other player monsters created at level 20 or higher, including giants, may generate with gauntlets of protection.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L320 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 320]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L338 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 338]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L409 EvilHack 0.7 makemon.c, line 409]</ref>

==Strategy==
One primary use of the gauntlets of protection is to provide a reliable source of MC3 for giants and tortles, whose bodies are too large to wear a cloak of protection. Non-illithid players using a source of [[reflection]] besdies [[Dragonbane#EvilHack|Dragonbane]] and/or forgoing [[gauntlets of power]] can use these gloves to maximize protection and keep the [[cloak]] slot open, e.g. for a [[robe]] or [[cloak of magic resistance]].

The '''helm of speed''' is a type of magical [[helm]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. Its default material is [[steel]], and it provides very fast [[speed]] when worn.

&&%s&& %s Centaur (starting race) {144377 2022-02-03T18:27:33Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* History */ The '''centaur''' is a playable race that appears in [[EvilHack]]. Like monster [[centaur]]s, they are strong, fast and proficient in archery.

Centaurs can be [[neutral]] or [[chaotic]], and can be played as a [[Barbarian]], [[Healer]], [[Knight]], [[Monk]], [[Priest]], [[Ranger]], or [[Valkyrie]].

==Racial benefits and restrictions==
Centaurs are among the physically stronger player races, and have higher hit point increases per [[experience level]] gained in comparison to [[Human (starting race)|humans]]. They start with intrinsic [[speed]], and gain [[jumping]] at [[experience level]] five and [[warning]] at level 10; this type of jumping is similar to the extrinsic from wearing [[jumping boots]], and is distinct from the jumping used by Knights.

While not as strong as [[Giant (starting race)|giants]], centaurs share their increased carrying capacity as a result of their half-equine build - however, this also prevents them from wearing any [[boots]] or [[riding]] steeds. The intrinsics they gain and the wider variety of armor available in the game can compensate for this, thankfully. Centaurs know the identities of all bow and crossbow weapons and their projectiles automatically, and get a [[multishot]] bonus with either type.

Despite their strength, centaurs are much more lacking in mental stats in comparison to other playable species, due to their wild nature.

==Strategy==
:''To be written''.

==History==
The centaur was first added in version 0.1.2, with additional adjustments to armor choices for both them and "monster" [[centaur]]s.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-012 EvilHack changelog, version 0.1.2]</ref> 

In version 0.4.2, a bug that still displayed the riding skill in the menu of the #[[enhance]] [[extended command]] for centaurs was removed.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-042 EvilHack changelog, version 0.4.2]</ref> 

Version 0.6.0 fixes issues with player centaurs and kicking.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-060 EvilHack changelog, version 0.6.0]</ref> 

Version 0.7.0 includes various fixes related to player centaurs and their [[player monster]] equivalents:<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-070 EvilHack changelog, version 0.4.2]</ref> 

* A chokepoint on the goal level of the [[Ranger quest]] that would otherwise be impassable for centaur Rangers was removed.
* Centaurian player monster gear is adjusted, and centaurs in general had their [[monster starting inventory]] adjusted to avoid generating them with armor they could not use.
* In previous versions, centaur Monks would use the random additional kick against any monster - as they cannot wear boots, this posed a significant and randomized risk of [[instadeath]] in various situations, e.g. from kicking a [[cockatrice]]. As of this version, the random kick attack will no longer fire against cockatrices and other similar monsters.
* Centaur kick attacks were buffed to be stronger than those of other player races.

Version 0.7.1 added centaur Knights and their player monster equivalents.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-071 EvilHack changelog, version 0.7.1]</ref>

All Giant Samurai start with a [[rustproof]] large splint mail, and are the only kind of player giant that can start with body armor.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/u_init.c#L268 EvilHack 0.7.0 u_init.c, line 268]</ref>

Large splint mail does not randomly generate, but can be [[wish]]ed for, and may be found in the [[bones]] of a Giant Samurai or of another player that has looted such bones.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/objects.c#L450 EvilHack 0.7.0 objects.c, line 450]</ref> Giant [[Samurai (player monster)|samurai]] [[player monster]]s will always generate with large splint mail.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.0/src/makemon.c#L300 EvilHack 0.7.0 makemon.c, line 300]</ref>

==Strategy==
Large splint mail is the only form of body armor that giants can wear, outside of [[chromatic dragon scales]] from [[Tiamat]] - but ''only'' giant Samurai are capable of wearing them, and it will not fit any other player giant. Giant samurai themselves may find it quite cumbersome to keep worn as the game progresses - enchanted [[mithril]] large splint mail may prove a worthwhile early wish for them.

&&%s&& %s Piety {146293 2022-06-26T03:10:32Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  [[FIQHack]] introduces a new player mechanic called '''piety''' which replaces the vanilla altar [[sacrifice]] / [[prayer]] mechanics. Piety is a measure of how much your god likes you (as opposed to [[alignment record]], which is a measure of how faithful you are to your god).

Piety is implemented as a scale which can be positive or negative, similar to how luck or alignment work in vanilla.  A positive piety value means your god likes you, a negative value means they are angry with you. Piety is increased by altar sacrifice.  Piety is decreased by things like sacrificing your own race as a non-chaotic, or killing a pet.

You begin every game with a piety of 0.

When your piety reaches 10000 * ( 2 ^ # gifts given )<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/d138b70ad9928268899ec8c63d1ab66436f687f1/libnethack/src/pray.c#L2169</ref><ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/d138b70ad9928268899ec8c63d1ab66436f687f1/libnethack/src/pray.c#L1589</ref>, a sacrifice gift is given and your piety is reset to 2000<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/d138b70ad9928268899ec8c63d1ab66436f687f1/libnethack/src/pray.c#L1628</ref>.

If your piety is >= 15000 when you pray on an altar, you will be crowned<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/d138b70ad9928268899ec8c63d1ab66436f687f1/libnethack/src/pray.c#L2180</ref><ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/d138b70ad9928268899ec8c63d1ab66436f687f1/libnethack/src/pray.c#L879</ref>.  This resets your piety to 5000<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/d138b70ad9928268899ec8c63d1ab66436f687f1/libnethack/src/pray.c#L794</ref>.

Any prayer with zero timeout, a happy god and positive alignment will increase your luck by 1 if possible<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/ea951b65528691c1782ac9326fc2f841be4a9def/libnethack/src/pray.c#L1634</ref>.

If you sacrifice on an altar of opposite alignment and your alignment is changed, your piety (to your new god) is set to zero<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/ea951b65528691c1782ac9326fc2f841be4a9def/libnethack/src/pray.c#L1187</ref>.

If you sacrifice your own race and you are not chaotic, your piety is reduced by 3000 (the other negative effects still apply)<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/ea951b65528691c1782ac9326fc2f841be4a9def/libnethack/src/pray.c#L1370</ref>.  There is no piety change for sacrificing your own race as a chaotic.
 
Killing a pet decreases your piety by 1000<ref>https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqhack/blob/33e95f977761f66186a1f9aea1ca5e5d262912a2/libnethack/src/hack.c#L2327</ref>.

The following mechanics generally work the same as in vanilla:
* Offering with nonzero prayer timeout
* Offering with a negative alignment rcord
* Offering an amulet.

The '''woolly mammoth''', {{orange|q}}, is a monster that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is the strongest member of the [[quadruped]] [[monster class]] in this variant, with a crushing trunk attack and two powerful tusk attacks that can send a foe flying. The woolly mammoth is also the only eligible [[steed]] for a [[Giant (starting race)|player giant]].

==Generation==
Woolly mammoths are only randomly generated in the [[Ice Queen's Realm]].

==Strategy==
A somewhat common strategy for the [[Astral Plane]] known as "woolly rain" involves using a [[cursed]] [[scroll of genocide]] to generate woolly mammoths, then using them to clear out various monsters, similar to the "purple rain" strategy involving [[purple worm]]s.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is a species of mammoth
	that lived during the Pleistocene until its extinction in the
	Holocene epoch.  It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species,
	beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene.

The '''honey badger''', {{black|r}}, is a monster that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It has a decently powerful bite-claw combo, and is capable of [[tunnel]]ing.

==Generation==
In addition to random generation, 1d4 honey badgers may spawn on any level with a [[beehive]].

==Strategy==
Honey badgers can spell doom for any player caught unawares, as they move at 12 speed and can dig through walls with ease. They also provide an incentive to reach beehives quickly as soon as you discover them - a honey badger will eat any [[royal jelly]] they can get their grubby little paws on. Their 0 AC and [[poison resistance]] also makes them much harder to dispatch and gives them a stellar defense against [[killer bee]]s, which they will attack on sight.

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Honey badger}}
The honey badger, ''mellivora capensis'', is a mammal found in Africa, Southwest Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is considered a member of the weasel family, and obtains a large part of its food by digging it out of burrows. Honey badgers are best known for their tendency to raid beehives in search of both bee larvae and honey, as well as their surprising viciousness against other predators such as lion cubs and black mambas. These traits have made honey badgers a popular animal among Internet users as early as 2008.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	The Honey badger (or ratel) is a tenacious small carnivore that
	has a reputation for being, pound for pound, Africa's most fearless
	animal despite its small size.  It is even listed as the "most
	fearless animal in the world" in the Guinness Book of Records.

	Honey badgers are reputed to go for the scrotum when attacking large
	animals.  The first published record of this behaviour was a
	circumstantial account by Stevenson-Hamilton (1947) where a badger
	reportedly castrated an adult Buffalo.  Other animals alleged to have
	been emasculated by honey badgers include wildebeest, waterbuck, kudu,
	zebra and man.  This has also been reported by other African tribes,
	but no direct evidence exists to support this behaviour.

The '''lesser nightmare''', {{green|u}}, is a monster that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is very similar to a [[pony]], though with a poisonous bite.

Eating a lesser nightmare corpse conveys a significant amount of [[poison resistance]].

==Generation==
Chaotic [[Knight]]s begin the game with a [[saddle]]d lesser nightmare as their default pet.

Lesser nightmares can grow up into nightmares, and then further into [[cauchemar]]s.

}}

===Generation===
Kathryn the Ice Queen is always found inside her castle on the third and final floor of the branch, and resides within the left inner chambers. She will always generate hostile, and is guarded by [[Bourbon]] and [[Ozzy]]; they generate peaceful, but will become hostile and protect her once she is attacked.

Kathryn the Ice Queen's [[monster starting inventory]] includes: an enchanted, [[erosion]]-proofed [[athame]] of frost, a pair of gloves, a pair of high boots, an [[amulet of reflection]], a [[ring of slow digestion]], and one of either a [[cloak of magic resistance]] or a [[cloak of displacement]]. If encountered on her birthday, she will additionally generate with roughly 4 times her usual HP and a [[potion of full healing]].

===Strategy===
In addition to ascension-level gear, the Ice Queen has the full range of monster spells to cast at her disposal, with her [[spellcasting]] geared towards a cold-based offense; this includes temporarily weakening the player's resistances, including resistance to cold in particular. In short, [[cold resistance]] is especially important here (as well as for the branch overall), along with [[acid resistance]] to blunt the worst damage from her acid blast spells; weakened cold resistance will cause your HP to slowly deplete, so unless you are capable of passively out-healing the frost damage, it is best to defeat her quickly. Defeating Kathryn will transform her into her Enchantress form, also pacifying Bourbon and Ozzy.

}}

===Generation===
Kathryn the Enchantress always appears after her Ice Queen form is defeated, and will be generated peaceful unless you are an [[Infidel]]. She retains whatever inventory she still possesses from her previous form.

===Strategy===
In this form, Kathryn has almost every resistance available in the game, alongside attacks and spells that can easily cleave through most of an ascension-worthy character's {{! of|full healing}}-and-[[nurse dance]]-bolstered HP. As such, she is orders of magnitude more difficult than any other monster in the game, and is considered impossible to defeat in normal play; even if somehow defeated, she will immediately resurrect at full HP, so there is no benefit to angering her.

Due to her generation method she is not typically a threat, and setting her off is easily avoidable with careful play. However, she does not like Infidels in the slightest: if you defeat her previous form as an Infidel, you will free her from the curse as normal, but this incurs a -2 alignment penalty and she will ''remain'' hostile; she is then rendered immobile and will stand in place for 100 turns. Once 100 turns have passed, she will come after you if you have not left in that time frame. This should give an Infidel just enough time to loot the crystal chests, free and saddle the trapped [[pegasus]], retrieve any [[egg]]s under it, and beeline for the stairs before you risk meeting with death at her hands.

</simpletabs>
{{clear}}

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Frozen}}
{{wikipedia|White Witch}}
Kathryn is the daughter of [[User:K2|EvilHack's developer]], and her companions Bourbon and Ozzy are based on the family's German Shepherd dogs. The Ice Queen is loosely based off of Elsa from the movie ''Frozen'' - Kathryn was seven years old when work began on the Ice Queen branch, and had watched the movie with her father so many times that the number is too large to be represented here; Elsa was her favorite movie character at the time. As implied by the [[encyclopedia]] entry, she is also somewhat based on the White Witch, the main antagonist of the ''Chronicles of Narnia'' books by C. S. Lewis.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	"The White Witch? Who is she?"
	"Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb.
	It's she that makes it always winter.  Always winter and
	never Christmas; think of that!"
	"How awful!" said Lucy.

	Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches
	of snow grew smaller.  Every moment more and more of the trees
	shook off their robes of snow.  Soon, wherever you looked,
	instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of firs or the
	black prickly branches of bare oaks and beeches and elms.
	Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared
	away altogether.  Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down on
	to the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky
	between the tree tops.
	   [ The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,
		by C.S. Lewis ]

'''Kas''', {{black|V}}, is a unique [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. He is the former right-hand servant of the powerful spellcaster [[Vecna]], and is the second most-powerful [[vampire]] encountered in the game after [[Vlad the Impaler]].

==Generation==
Kas is found within [[Vecna's Domain]], residing in the stronghold that constitutes the branch's second level. He is generated asleep at the rightmost portion of the eastern room, standing on top of the down stair next to an [[iron safe]] and [[chest]], and [[Monster starting inventory|is always generated with]] [[The Sword of Kas|his namesake sword]].<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.1/dat/vecna.des#L196 dat/vecna.des in EvilHack 0.7.1, line 196]</ref>

==Strategy==
In terms of base stats, Kas is slightly stronger than a [[vampire royal]] and "only" has 16 [[speed]]. Even so, he should absolutely not be taken lightly - on top of being fairly fast and hitting decently hard, the Sword of Kas can deal fearsome damage even if you [[poison resistance]], and its various bonuses only further augment his already-strong pair of weapon attacks.

==History==
Kas was first introduced to EvilHack in version 0.7.0 as part of the second of three commits that added Vecna's Domain.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/59f3575fb1130f3cf051663f81bc851106f4a928 EvilHack commit 59f3575 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part one)."]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/f0d135255a6060adbe82a095efdcfc402218866e EvilHack commit f0d1352 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part two) - artifacts, Kas (unique monster)."]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/919cd959f737dd6791411dfda7e93c0ddb1c6756 EvilHack commit 919cd95 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part three) - levels, minor tweaks."]</ref>

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Kas the Bloody-Handed}}
Kas the Bloody-Handed is derived from the Greyhawk setting of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', where he was the former most trusted lieutenant of the despotic lich Vecna for many years. He ultimately turned traitor and brought about Vecna's temporary downfall, though details of his service and subsequent betrayal vary with the edition. The Sword of Kas was either created or procured for Kas by Vecna, and is consistently tied to Vecna's other relics - only the Sword and Vecna's [[The Hand of Vecna|hand]] [[The Eye of Vecna|and eye]] remained after their battle. Kas used the sword against his former master, and may have been goaded into doing so by the Sword itself.

How Kas became a vampire also varies depending on sources as to whether it was before or after the betrayal. In one such source, the battle between Kas and Vecna destroys the Rotting Tower they were in, leaving only the Sword and Vecna's hand and eye, and Kas is flung across the multiverse to another of Vecna's dwellings near the Negative Energy Plane, which changed Kas into a vampire - he then took on the moniker "Kas the Destroyer".

In EvilHack, Kas appears to still be loyal to Vecna, among other things implying that he was already a vampiric being beforehand.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
	Kas the Bloody-Handed was the most trusted lieutenant of the
	despotic lich Vecna, and wielder of the Sword of Kas.

	After many years of loyal service to Vecna, Kas eventually
	betrayed his master.  It is said that the sword itself whispered
	to Kas, convincing him to slay his master and usurp his power.

'''The Sword of Kas''' is an [[intelligent]] [[artifact weapon]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is [[chaotic]]-aligned, and its [[base item]] is a [[two-handed sword]] made of [[gemstone]].

==Generation==
The Sword of Kas [[Monster starting inventory|is always generated]] in the possession of [[Kas]] within [[Vecna's Domain]]. It cannot be [[wish]]ed for; if left in bones, it will revert to a 'mundane' gemstone two-handed sword.

Due to its generation method, it does not increase the [[artifact]] count for purposes of [[wish]]ing.

==Description==
The Sword of Kas has a +10 [[to-hit]] bonus and is permanently coated in [[poison]], dealing extra poison damage against monsters without [[poison resistance]]; it also deals double damage versus [[cross-aligned]] monsters and [[lich]]es, and will deal three times the damage when used specifically against [[Vecna]]. While wielded, it grants [[stoning resistance]] and sets the wielder's [[strength]] to 25 - it is additionally [[bloodthirsty]] similar to [[Stormbringer]], meaning that you will attack any monster you walk into while wielding it.

==Strategy==
The Sword of Kas is often a vital part of most players' kits for dealing with Vecna - keep in mind that [[lawful]] characters take alignment penalties for using poisoned weapons, while [[Priest]]s of any kind suffer a -30 to-hit penalty from trying to use it on top of potentially [[anger]]ing their [[god]].

A character capable of defeating Kas is one that has ''usually'' completed their quest - in the event you are lawful and have not yet done so, it is usually best to refrain from wielding the Sword on anything more than a very-sparingly basis.

==History==
The Sword of Kas was first introduced to EvilHack in version 0.7.0, added alongside Kas as part of the second of three commits related to Vecna's Domain.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/59f3575fb1130f3cf051663f81bc851106f4a928 EvilHack commit 59f3575 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part one)."]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/f0d135255a6060adbe82a095efdcfc402218866e EvilHack commit f0d1352 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part two) - artifacts, Kas (unique monster)."]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/commit/919cd959f737dd6791411dfda7e93c0ddb1c6756 EvilHack commit 919cd95 - "New branch: Vecna's domain (part three) - levels, minor tweaks."]</ref>

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Kas the Bloody-Handed}}
In the Greyhawk setting of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', the Sword of Kas was given by Vecna to his then-right-hand-man and most trusted lieutenant, Kas the Bloody-Handed; Kas would later turn against Vecna and (temporarily) destroy him using the sword. As details of Kas's service and subsequent betrayal vary with the edition, so too do the origins of the sword: In the 1st edition's ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', Vecna only procured the sword for his chief lieutenant; one telling in much later editions has Vecna creating the Sword of Kas himself and imbuing it with a "portion of his consciousness". As alluded to by the [[encyclopedia]] entry, some sources indicate that Kas may have been goaded into betrayal by the whispers of the Sword itself.

Regardless, the Sword is is consistently tied to Vecna and his other relics, specifically Vecna's [[The Hand of Vecna|hand]] [[The Eye of Vecna|and eye]]. Both relics and the Sword were the only remaining objects in the area after their fight, with Vecna destroyed for the time being and Kas being flung across many Planes by the resulting destruction. Its appearance, properties and hit dice have also varied between editions - the Sword as it appears in EvilHack is something of an amalgamation (e.g., the 25 strength comes from the +10 strength bonus it granted to the wielder in 3rd Edition).<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.1/include/artilist.h#L206 include/artilist in EvilHack 0.7.1, line 206]</ref><ref>[https://screenrant.com/dungeons-and-dragons-powerful-items-where-to-find/ ScreenRant - Dungeons & Dragons: 20 Powerful Items That Are Impossible To Find (And Where To Find Them)]</ref>

==Encyclopedia entry==
Kas and the Sword share the same encyclopedia entry:
{{encyclopedia|
	Kas the Bloody-Handed was the most trusted lieutenant of the
	despotic lich Vecna, and wielder of the Sword of Kas.

	After many years of loyal service to Vecna, Kas eventually
	betrayed his master.  It is said that the sword itself whispered
	to Kas, convincing him to slay his master and usurp his power.

Monks in [[dNetHack]] have special moves that are triggered by patterns of movement/attacks. Any action that is not movement or a melee attack breaks the current chain of input. All moves cost 8 energy.

== Move inputs ==

*‚áí‚áí or ‚áò‚áò: Swoop (Chiropteran)/Dive kick (other)
*‚áó‚áí or ‚áí‚áò: Aura bolt
*‚áë‚áí or ‚áó‚áò: Wing storm (Chiropteran)/Bird kick (other)
*‚áñ‚áí or ‚áë‚áò: Meteor drive
*‚áê‚áí or ‚áñ‚áò: Flurry/Pummel

== Move explanations ==
=== Dive kick ===
A single target directly in front of the PC is [[kick]]ed twice. Having high encumbrance can cause the kick to fail as normal.

=== Swoop (Chiropterans only) ===
A single target directly in front of the PC is attacked with the PC's main hand weapon, the off-hand weapon (if two-weaponing), and the Chiro's bite attack.

=== Aura bolt ===
Fires a ray capable of hitting multiple targets in front of the PC. The ray does not bounce off walls, and will not be fired if it could hit a peaceful or tame monster. The ray does 1d4 damage per three levels, reaching 10d4 damage at level 28 ((level+2)/3).

If the PC's alignment record is 4 or greater, the ray is holy energy that does 2x damage vs. holy-hating targets like demons and the undead.

If the PC's alignment record is -4 or lower, the ray is unholy energy that does 2x damage vs. unholy-hating targets like angels.
