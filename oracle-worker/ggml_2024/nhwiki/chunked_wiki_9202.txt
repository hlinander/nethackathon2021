Crowning and its consequences in NetHack 3.4
Compiled for 3.1.3 by Boudewijn Waijers.
Updated for 3.4.3 by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>

When you pray a lot of nice things can happen. If you are in good
standing with your god ("piously aligned"; at least +20) and
sufficiently lucky ("extremely lucky"; at least +10), one of these
things is that you may be "crowned" by your god.

If this happens, you are not only granted a title (visible with
enlightenment or at the end of the game), but some other effects (most
of them beneficial) happen as well. The title you will gain is the
following:

Lawful:  Hand of Elbereth
Neutral: Envoy of Balance
Chaotic: Glory of Arioch

Then, you gain some useful intrinsics (if you didn't have them already,
of course):

* cold resistance
* fire resistance
* poison resistance
* sleep resistance
* shock resistance
* see invisible

Next, you may gain an item, depending on your class and alignment:

* Wizards will receive a (blessed) spellbook of finger of death unless they
  are already carrying one, or are wielding Vorpal Blade or Stormbringer.
* Monks will receive a (blessed) spellbook of restore ability unless they
  are already carrying one, or are wielding an artifact.

If these classes do not receive a spellbook, or for any other class:

* Lawful:  If you are wielding (as primary, if two-weaponing) a
           non-artifact long sword, it is changed into Excalibur if
           that does not yet exist in your game.
* Neutral: If Vorpal Blade does not yet exist in your game, it is
           created at your feet.
* Chaotic: If Stormbringer does not yet exist in your game, it is
           created at your feet.

If you received a weapon gift, it is blessed, unrusted and made
rustproof, and set to at least +1. If you received no gift (or you
received a spellbook gift of a spell that you already knew), your
currently-wielded (primary) weapon (or weapon-tool) receives the same
enhancements, and your skill in it is unrestricted. In all cases, your
skill in the appropriate alignment gift weapon is unrestricted whether
you got it or not: long sword for lawfuls and neutrals, broad sword
for chaotics.

There is, of course, a disadvantage to balance all this generosity:
after crowning, your average prayer time-out (the time you have to
wait between prayers) is greatly increased. So, if you already have a
decent weapon and the above intrinsics, being named is a BAD thing. If
you pray often enough, it WILL happen eventually, though.

The dragon resistances in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

There are nine basic colours of dragon in NetHack 3.4. These breathe
eight different types of dragonbreath; a resistance can be acquired
(either intrinsic or extrinsic) to each of these types, and these are
therefore sometimes referred to as the "dragon resistances". This
spoiler discusses how to acquire these resistances and the protection
they give. Note that, as a general rule, any intrinsics acquired solely
by experience level can be lost by being drained below that level.

HP and power starting values, level increases, and regeneration in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

Initial hit points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characters start with a fixed number of hit points according to
their role:

Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
 11   14   14   11   14   12   12   13   10   13    8   14   10

modified by racial bonuses:

Dwa  Elf  Gno  Hum  Orc
 +4   +1   +1   +2   +1


Hit point gain per level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This varies according to whether your character is "high level" or not;
more experienced characters generally gain HP more slowly. High level
characters are those that have reached the following experience levels:

Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
 14   10   10   20   10   10   10   12   11   11   14   10   12

The base HP (and max HP) increment when gaining an experience level is:

      Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
low:  +d8 +d10  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d6  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8
high:  +1   +2   +2   +1   +2   +1   +1   +1   +1   +1   +0   +2   +1

with racial modifiers:

      Dwa  Elf  Gno  Hum  Orc
low:  +d3   +1   +1  +d2   +1
high:  +2   +1   +0   +1   +0

and a bonus or penalty for constitution:

    3 : -2
  4-6 : -1
 7-14 : +0
15-16 : +1
   17 : +2
   18 : +3
   19+: +4

You will always gain at least one HP when gaining a level.


Hit point regeneration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your hit points are reduced below their maximum level, they will
usually regenerate over time. HP do not regenerate during the period of
invulnerability while praying to a receptive god.

If you are polymorphed into another monster, you will regain 1 HP every
20 turns provided you are no worse than Burdened (every turn, ignoring
encumbrance, if you have the regeneration intrinsic); the exception is
if you are a sea monster out of water, when you will lose 1 HP each turn
(but never to zero).

If you are in your normal form, the frequency and amount of HP you
regenerate depends on your experience level and constitution. Unless you
have regeneration, you will not regain HP if you are moving or fighting
while Stressed or worse (indeed, doing so while Strained will cause you
to lose 1 HP every 30 turns, every 10 turns while Overtaxed, until you
don't have enough stamina to move or you pass out).

If your experience level (XL) is 10 or less:

  regain 1 HP every number of turns depending on the following table:
       XL:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
    TURNS:  15  11   9   8   7   6   5   5   4   3

If your experience level (XL) is 11 or greater:

  every 3 turns, regain HP depending on CON. 
  CON = 3-12 : 1 HP.
  CON = 13+ : d(CON), but no more than XL-9.

If you have regeneration:

  gain 1 HP on any turn which you would not otherwise.



Initial power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characters start the game with an amount of magical power dependent
on their role:

Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
 1    1    1   1+d4 1+d4 2+d2 4+d3  1    1    1    1    1   4+d3

modified by racial bonuses:

Dwa Elf Gno Hum Orc
 +0  +2  +2  +1  +1


Power gain per level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For some roles only, this varies according to whether your character is
"high level" or not; more experienced characters may gain power slightly
more quickly. High level characters are those that have reached the
following experience levels:

Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Wiz
 20   10   10   10   12

The amount of power gained is determined by rolling a die with
((WIS / 2) + X) sides. X is usually 1, but is 2 for high level
Healers, Knights, Monks, and Priests, and low level Wizards; and is
3 for high level Wizards. This die-roll is modified by racial bonuses
or penalties:

Dwa Elf Gno Hum Orc
 -1  +2  +1  +1  +0

and the outcome may be subject to a further multiplier:

Bar, Val: x0.75
Hea, Kni: x1.5
Pri, Wiz: x2

It is possible (in the case of dwarves) not to gain power when gaining a
level.


Power regeneration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you use power, it slowly returns to its maximum level at a rate
dependent on your experience level (XL), role, wisdom, and intelligence.

Non-Wizards: every (38 - XL) * 2/3 turns
Wizards:     every (38 - XL) * 1/2 turns
(Or every turn if carrying the Eye of the Aethiopica):

regain d(((WIS + INT) / 15) + 1) power points.

Miscellaneous intrinsics in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

This spoiler covers all the intrinsics that are neither dragon resistances
(see drgn-343.txt) nor conferred by wearing rings (see rint-343.txt). It
does not cover statuses (confusion, hallucination, etc); the dividing line
is sometimes blurry, but as a general rule of thumb if it appears on the
status line it's a status, not an intrinsic. Note that, as a general rule,
any intrinsics acquired solely by experience level can be lost by being
drained below that level.

amphibiousness
  acquired by
    Polymorphing into a floating eye, water elemental, newt, (baby)
    crocodile, or any ;.
  effects
    You can enter water safely.
    Eels' drowning attacks will not drown you.
    Fog clouds' moisture attacks will not harm you.

astral vision
  acquired by
    Wearing the Eyes of the Overworld (Monk Quest Artifact).
  effect
    Spaces within a radius 3 are visible even if dark or if line of sight
    is blocked.
    Blinding has no effect on your ability to see.

blinding resistance
  acquired by
    Wielding Sunsword (light-based only).
    Wearing lenses or a visored helmet (physical-based only).
  effects
    Light-based resistance protects against the blinding attacks of
    yellow lights and Archons, and blinding from lightning bolts,
    engraving with a wand of lightning, failed use of a crystal ball,
    magic traps, and expensive cameras.
    Physical-based resistance protects against the blinding attack of
    ravens and cobras, but not against dust vortices or thrown cream pies.
    Note that being blinded already, or being polymorphed into a form
    that has no eyes, is an absolute defence against blinding.

clairvoyance
  acquired by
    Wearing a cornuthaum as a Wizard.
    Donating between 200*XL and (400*XL)-1 zorkmids, more than 1/3 your
    current visible gold, to a priest (lasts 500 to 999 (more) turns per
    donation).
    Carrying the Amulet of Yendor.
  effects
