There is no way to improve fighting with improvised weapons but hitting with the butt of your pulse rifle might be beneficial to conserve ammo anyways.

== Mutant powers ==
Mutant powers, accessed through the '''Z''' or '''m''' keys, allow the player to use mutations that the character has acquired. Psions start with two randomly chosen mutations, but all classes may gain them through drinking from a vat or a canister of mutagen. Mutations come in varying levels, with the chance of success and the magnitude of effect tied to the amount of enhancement each mutation has. Psions can put skill points in individual mutant powers to make them easier to use and more powerful.

The use of a mutation costs the character an equivalent number of Charisma points to its level. Charisma does regenerate slowly up to its unaltered maximum, but temporary boosts may be gained from canisters of nano cola. Nano cola may also boost the characters Charisma above the normal maximum, but the effect does wear off with the temporary Charisma boost slowly decreasing over time. Persistent mutant powers prevent amount of Charisma spent to use it as long as they are active.

Some items reduce the chances of using mutant powers when worn. Cranial bionic implants have the most effect but even heavy body armor may reduce the ability to employ powers. A psionic amplifier modifies the chances of using mutant powers by its enhancement thus it can be beneficial when enhancement is positive.

== Items ==
See separate article: [[ZAPM Items]].

== Monsters ==
There are 80 monster types total in ZAPM 0.8.2. Level dictates when it will appear. There is generation algorithm for monsters similar to what NetHack uses. Monsters generated tend to be up to level which is average of your experience level and location depth level. HD is [[hit dice]]. Creatures get 1d8 [[hit point]]s for every hit dice point. If it is zero monster gets 1d4 hits.

|{{lightgray|b}}
|1

|fuel barrel
|Surprisingly this is a monster you can blow up for experience. It cannot be pushed around like a [[boulder]]. Attempting to do so will execute a normal melee attack possibly blowing it up in your face. For early characters this may prove fatal.
|-
|{{blue|F}}

|0
|warp fungus
|Stationary enemy with [[corrosive]] sliming attack. You may prefer to kill it bare handed if your melee weapon can be corroded.
|-
|{{magenta|x}}

|grid bug
|A straight tribute to NetHack, the [[grid bug]] has the same movement restrictions and is equally weak enemy. Spawns in group of 1k4 bugs.
|-
|{{brown|w}}

|bore worm
|Early slow enemy spawned in groups of 1k4 worms.
|-
|{{brown|c}}
|1
|0
|tribble
|Those monsters multiply and do it fast! Take care to control the population if your character cannot kill them quickly. On the other hand they can be easily [[farm]]ed for experience but game flags them as never having any items generated, even the originals. They are rarely generated.
|-
|{{cyan|a}}
|1
|1
|flying toaster
|Toasters may be difficult to hit due to their small size which grants them AC bonus. Appears in groups of 2k4 which early on may cause you to be swarmed. Retreat to [[corridor]] when fight does not go well.
|-
|{{brown|m}}
|1
|1
|mynock
|Pathetically weak attack with sub-par speed makes them hardly a threat.
|-
|{{brown|i}}

|1
|giant cockroach
|While cockroaches are slow their attack takes half the usual time making up for their deficiency. Beware, cockroaches can [[hide]] under objects. A group of these can be hiding under merchandise in shop. Do not underestimate them.
|-
|{{magenta|t}}

|1
|man eating plant
|Tough sessile plant with very strong poisonous bite. Take down at range.
|-
|{{lightgray|G}}
|1
|1
|little grey alien
|Essentially a joke monster, the little grey alien starts equipped with an anal probe and is not afraid to use it ... on you! Successful hit will make you feel violated and inflict timed "Sore" (butt) status which carries -50 speed penalty. Be on guard if other monsters accompany the greys.
|-
|{{brown|x}}

|2
|ratbot
|Small robotic monster with three bonus AC points. A respectable foe, its only weakness in early game are potentially low hit points.
|-
|{{green|t}}

|green killer tomato
|Generated in groups of up to three. Generally puny.
|-
|{{magenta|h}}

|mutant human
|Weak entity capable of hypnotizing you when adjacent, putting you to sleep if successful. Will happily pound on you while you snooze. Can use regeneration power.
|-
|{{green|g}}
|1
|2
|space goblin
|Groups of those unimpressive humanoids can be the first entities to actually shoot at you. May be generated with pea shooters which are good to use if you did not start with a gun. Especially considering pea shooter does not require ammunition. Goblins very often have some cash with them.
|-
|{{lightgray|S}}
|4
|2
|tapioca pudding
|The pudding is tough, horribly slow and possesses a paralyzing attack. Can be easily whacked with hit and run tactics. Most probably it has been inspired by [[floating eye]]. If you get hit you can be paralyzed for 2k6 turns and without luck you can be paralysis-locked.
|-
|{{brown|b}}

|smart bomb
|Explodes when you come near it so just shoot it down if you want the experience.
|-
|{{yellow|x}}

|catbot
|Agile bot with 3 points of AC, good hit points and respectable damage. Has 50% chance of being generated peaceful. Good early target for restraining bolts.
|-
|{{gray|x}}
|2
|3
|dogbot
|Very much like catbot but lower agility and higher strength and constitution. Unlike NetHack which makes [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s equal in power dogbot is a little more preferable to catbot as a pet.
|-

|red killer tomato
|Generated in groups of up to three and killed almost as easily as their green counterparts.
|-
|{{red|h}}

|redshirt
|One of first enemies with ranged weapon, easy to kill. Notable for having 5% chance of being generated with a tricorder.
|-
|{{green|O}}
|2
|3
|space orc
|Can deal good damage in brawl and very likely to have one of a pistol, shotgun or pea shooter. Has a tiny chance of starting with a ray gun so make sure not to stay in long corridors when facing them. Created in groups of up to four.
|-
|{{brown|o}}
|1
|3
|alien egg
|Usually encountered in alien nests it stays harmless until it hatches. Do not risk coming near and preferably use strong ranged weapon because taking damage and surviving is strong impulse for hatching. [[Grenade]]s (not stun!) are recommended way to clear alien nest of eggs if you have them.
|-
|{{green|S}}

|vat slime
|Slow, has corrosive attack. May be generated by drinking from vats.
|-
|{{cyan|C}}
|2
|3
|cylon centurion
|Gets a laser pistol. Thanks to it getting blinded is common. Not recommended as a pet because once it runs out of energy cells it becomes weak.
|-
|{{white|h}}
|1
|4
|stormtrooper
|With so weak hit dice at his level and helmet which hurts accuracy the troopers are a pushover. They go down like flies. Their body armor can be sold in shops for considerable amount of buckazoids but is quite heavy. Their guns, blasters are not affected by reflection.
|-
|{{brightblue|x}}
|3
|4
|astromech droid
|Has a damaging zapping attack (beware - your implants may get jolted out) but is a bit slow. There it 80% chance for it to be generated peaceful. Makes fine pet.
|-
|{{yellow|X}}
|3
|4
|protocol droid
|Has unique ability to translate chirps and beeps of other bots if restrained and in close proximity. Quite valuable trait, a reasonable strategy is to capture one and lock it in an unused room in Robot Town. Like stromech droid it has 80% chance of being peaceful but is a slightly weaker pet. If you already have means of translation prefer other companions.
|-
|{{green|x}}

|4
|scrubbot
|Has 80 % chance of being generated peaceful. Judging by combat qualities alone it is strongest of the three bots.
|-
|{{blue|c}}

|crite
|It would be merely average combatant if not for its poisonous quill melee attack. Kill from afar if you can.
|-
|{{green|h}}

|high ping bastard
|Somewhat slow but is usually generated with shotgun. Fortunately it does not have much ammo.
|-
|{{red|$}}
|3
|4
|creeping credits
|Mimics money in plain view. When you come near it steals some from your wallet and teleports away to lay ambush somewhere else, much like a [[leprechaun]] does. Becomes harmless when you drop all your buckazoids. Is generated with 4d100 buckazoids.
|-
|{{yellow|C}}
|5
|5
|cylon command centurion
|Gets a laser pistol and same amount of cells as regular centurion. It is not stronger in combat either. However, it has lots of hit points so usually it manages to shoot his fill before you destroy him.
|-
|{{brown|k}}
|3
|5
|klingon
|One in five is generated with a bat'leth. This weapon packs a wallop in melee so beware. Situation can become bad if his buddies blind you with phasers while he is cutting you up to pieces.
|-
|{{red|@}}
|2
|5
|troubleshooter
|Dangerous because most will have suits of reflec armor which will render your laser weapons useless. They come with often buggy laser pistol and a large stack of energy cells. Sometimes they may get some grenades instead of the cells which is worse. If luck does not favor you the grenades may be radiation grenades. As if that was not enough they have a significant chance of getting a ray gun.
|-
|{{gray|N}}
|2
|5
|cheerleader ninja
|Has fast meele attacks, very often getting two kicks of punches in a turn. May start with katana in 10% cases which incidentally makes her a less dangerous.
|-
|{{brightblue|B}}
|2
|5
|borg
|Unimpressive by themselves newly generated Borg get +1 to [[AC]] for each previously killed Borg.
|-
|{{brown|f}}
|1
|5
|facehugger
|Quick and hard to hit the facehugger will implant you in close combat. Successful hit will cause you to get pregnant status. If left alone this will end in chestburster ripping your body open, killing you. When that happens death cause put in high score is "died during childbirth". To survive visit the docbot, quaff certain canisters or get lucky when drinking from a vat.

|radbeetle
|Its bite is not too strong but is poisonous. Fairly common monster in sewers.
|-
|{{red|O}}
|4
|5
|space orc boss
|Fairly strong and always gets a flak jacket. May start with shotgun (30% chance) or laser rifle (70% chance). Additionally, space orc bosses have a 10% chance of having a ray gun. If that was not enough he may get up to three buddies.
|-
|{{red|c}}
|3
|5
|chestburster
|A prelude to aliens chestburster is fairly scary when you let it come near you. When killed splashes acid blood around. Gets 4 points of bonus AC. The chestburster from the docbot's caesarean section may remain peaceful.
|-
|{{purple|A}}
|5
|6
|alien princess
|Much tougher version of chestburster with faster clawing speed. Also gets 4 more AC. Beware!
|-
|{{brightblue|r}}

|recognizer
|Slow but tough with powerful melee attack.
|-
|{{red|i}}
|4
|6
|radspider
|Getting bitten delivers poison but also may grant you shoot web mutant power in 10% cases, unless all of the poison damage was resisted. Unlike most of those kind of monsters radspiders are always generated alone.
|-
|{{red|k}}
|6
|6
|klingon captain
|Gets a flak jacket, phaser with some ammo seven out of ten also carry bat'leth. There is a 15% chance of getting a ray gun on top of that. Fortunately the captain is solitary creature.
|-
|{{brightmagenta|d}}
|6
|6
|pink horror
|Tough beast with quick and strong bite. Contrary to Warhammer lore it does not split into two blue horrors in ZAPM. Comes in groups of up to three.
|-
|{{magenta|F}}
|4
|6
|mi-go
|Mi-go will try to operate on your brain in combat. First they need to remove your helmet, then remove  implants from your frontal, parietal and occipital lobes if you have any. This costs them a turn for each. When they make an incision into your brain next hit will prove fatal. Mi-go will extract your brain. Often drop a Brain Cylinder when killed.
|-

|smart missile
|A mobile smart bomb.
|-
|{{purple|k}}

|klingon commander
|His or her flak jacket and phaser are always enhanced to +2. Sometimes gets a bat'leth (30% chance) but if it is granted then the weapon also is +2. 25% chance for ray gun.
|-
|{{lightgray|T}}
|6
|7
|usenet troll
|Guaranteed to carry a computer and very likely to have several floppies, perhaps even a cracked one. 
|-
|{{cyan|h}}
|7
|7
|low ping bastard
|Somewhat fast and likely to carry a railgun. One railgun shot deals 3d10 damage. Fortunately it does not have much ammo like its counterpart the high ping bastard. Often has enhanced armor.
|-
|{{green|E}}
|6
|7
|space elf
|Space elves only get a laser pistol and wooden dagger making them incongruously weak for their danger level. They are likely to get a ray gun though so be on your guard.
|-
|{{green|N}}
|8
|8
|mutant ninja turtle
|Fast and tough with good melee attack. Often come in groups of four. May get a katana or a pair of nunchucks. Chance for ray gun (15%).
|-
|{{brightblue|N}}
|7
|8
|cyborg ninja
|Fast and strong. Gets a chameleon suit, katana or a light saber (10% chance). In the latter case cyborg ninja has very high damage potential.
|-
|{{purple|i}}
|6
|8
|radscorpion
|Has a fast clawing attacks but may also use its highly poisonous stinger.
|-
|{{white|q}}
|6

|killer rabbit
|Boss monster! Is very fast, has strong bite and can terrify from afar. Additionally it appears in wide open area allowing it to stay out of your line of fire easily.
|-
|{{red|A}}
|7
|8
|alien warrior
|Dubbed death-on-a-stick, the alien warrior has very fast claw attacks and awesomely high strength allowing it to deal copious amounts of damage up close. Has enough hit points to enable it to close distance to player without dying. Additionally it splashes acid everywhere on death and can hide under objects. To make matters worse it is generated in groups of 1k4 warriors. Also, it is usually present in alien nests. In NetHack terms think about hasted [[minotaur]] with [[gas spore]] explosion causing equipment [[erosion]] thrown in. To make matters worse it is common monster for its depth.
|-
|{{white|G}}
|6
|8
|tall grey alien
|Spawns with anal probe, regenerates and can hypnotize you. It uses all those to put you to sleep, then probe to slow you (this generates message "you have an unpleasant dream") and regenerate from wounds you dealt earlier. Given they spawn in groups this has possibility to essentially sleep-lock you until something nasty comes for the kill.
|-
|{{red|E}}
|7
|9
|space elf lord
|Slightly better equipped than ordinary space elf the lord is still easy prey compared to most monsters generated at its depth. The only potentially threatening factors is 25% chance for ray gun and 15% for light saber.
|-
|{{brightcyan|@}}
|7
|9
|aquamarine marine
|Their armor has great AC and does not encumber when worn, being self-powered. Usually they get weak assault pistol and chainsaw but occasionally might be generated with pulse rifle.
|-
|{{lightgray|M}}
|10
|9
|monolith
|Being unable to move monolith mostly sits quietly in center of a room. If angered they can terrify, regenerate and hit hard in melee. The trick is to touch them bare handed while they are still peaceful, which instantly awards you an experience level.
|-
|{{brown|L}}
|7
|9
|lawyer
|Lawyer is somewhat similar to [[lich]]. Having telepathy and teleportation it can teleport to you, harass you and when wounded teleport away. Their powers include reading a cease and desist letter to you (paralyzes you in fear), suing for damages (steals money), seizing evidence (steals computer and pirated floppies) and summoning witnesses (i.e. monsters). In addition to generating randomly, they may also generate after using cracked floppy disks.
|-
|{{white|X}}
|10
|10
|clerkbot
|All [[shop]]s in ZAPM are attended by these. One in four has energy shield equipped. Weapon employed is zapper which can [[stun]] you. Has up to six thousand buckazoids in initial possession. No consequence for killing clerkbots.
|-
|{{green|X}}
|10
|10
|docbot
|Having no zapper docbot can smash into you for some damage of use built-in anal probe. The only docbot is offering its services on Robot Town clinic, making it unlikey you want to destroy it. However if you do you can find a bunch of beneficial canisters on it. Has up to two thousand buckazoids in initial possession.
|-
|{{green|@}}
|9
|11
|mean green marine
|Their armor has great AC and does not encumber when worn, being self-powered. Unlike aquamarine marines they have good chances to get pulse rifle. Additionally they regularly get a restoration canister and/or healing canister.
|-
|{{yellow|H}}

|11
|50 foot woman
|Can deal significant hurt in melee due to enormous damage bonus from strength but is slow.
|-
|{{magenta|E}}
|8
|11
|space elf queen
|Has a 50% chance of being generated with light saber, making her dangerous in melee. She often gets good rare equipment like energy dome and is guaranteed to have elven space suit. Can use several mutant powers: hypnosis, terror, regeneration, teleport, telepathy.
|-
|{{brightmagenta|A}}
|12
|13
|alien queen
|Not as fast as alien warrior and cannot hide under objects but has stronger bite. Otherwise this is tougher alien warrior.
|-
|{{brown|D}}
|10
|13
|dalek
|Comes with energy shield and a hundred energy cells to power it allowing it to survive even [[disintegration]] rays. Offensively it uses powerful laser which needs no ammunition. (And like all ZapM monsters it can't use staircases.)
|-
|{{brightred|X}}
|12
|14
|warbot
|Powerful, fast bot with laser cannon and two hundred energy cells. Guaranteed ray gun.
|-
|{{red|X}}
|12

|14
|giant ape
|Essentially a stronger version of 50 foot woman.
|-
|{{white|@}}
|14
|15
|Bastard Operator From Hell
|Boss monster who waits at deepest level of Gamma Caves. He has several mutant powers including teleport, optic blast and unique to him darkness power. BOFH always receives ray gun, pea shooter, +2 ordinary jumpsuit and +1 set of reflec armor. He also carries computer with guaranteed cracked floppy disk and up to two other disks. It is not recommended to deal fire damage to him for this reason. He is not very dangerous at this point.
|-

== Vats ==
Sludge vats are ZAPM's analog of [[sink]]s. You can drink from them and pour canisters into them by dropping. Dropping other things on their tile has no extraordinary effects - it just has them sink under the sludge and disappear permanently, even if the vat later dries up.

Vats can contain healthy or unhealthy sludge and be radioactive or not. If they are radioactive the tile will emit radiation and camping in the same spot as sludge vat can prove fatal long term. Vats are initially generated radioactive and unhealthy.

=== Quaffing ===
Each time you quaff from a vat there is one in three chance for it to dry up and disappear. If you received mutant power or the electric shock the chance is one in two instead.

The table has four columns describing chances for effects to happen. The legend is as follows:
* R - radioactive
* NR - not radioactive
* H - healthy
* UH - unhealthy

=== Pouring ===
Drop canister on vat tile to be asked to pour it in. Pouring may change how healthy the vat is or if it is radioactive. Sometimes the vat may get destroyed.

Health value is a number which starts at zero and is increased or decreased by two points if the description below reads more/less healthy or by one point if it reads somewhat more/less healthy.

A vat which has two or more healthiness value always rolls on healthy effect subtable. If it has zero it always rolls on unhealthy effect subtable. If the value is exactly one point the decision which of the tables to use is decided by coin flip.

ZAPM provides only a few [[intrinsics]] of its own. Most resistances unlike NetHack are treated as flat numeric damage reduction. Some intrinsics like scent, breathless and can swim are unobtainable by player character.

* Air supply
: Found exclusively on two helmets (space helmet and stormtrooper helmet) it allows to traverse sewers without getting sick.
* Auto regeneration
: Causes you to restore at least one hit point every turn.
* Blind
: Distinct from the timed [[blindness]] effect caused most often by being shot at with laser weaponry. Granted by blindfold.
* Brain shielded
: Wearing brain shield will protect against hypnosis, mental blasts, lawyer's cease and desist power and monolith induced fear. All are uncommon threats but quite nasty.
* Bug sensing
: Innate ability of Software Engineers unattainable by other means. Instantly reveals [[beatitude]] of all encountered items.
* Crazy Ivan
: This pointless user interface degradation is bestowed only by cortex crossover. Having it swaps your movement commands - e.g. north becomes south. It is interesting to note this intrinsic is being xored internally. Gaining it twice (or any even number of times) effectively cancels it. This is the most compelling argument not to install-test implants in ZAPM, besides the narcoleptor.
* Health monitoring
: A health monitor implant will color hit point display and cause game to emit low hit point warnings.
* Light-saber deflection
: This is not present as true intrinsic but is handled by item-specific check. Light saber besides granting "regular" reflection can also deflect shots of force damage. Those are only used by blasters and pea shooters.
* Lucky
: Possession of the rabbit's foot item grants this. It applies to many rolls and hence has a greater effect than [[luck]] in NetHack does.
* Motion detection
: Active motion tracker will detect nearby creatures. Monsters having ability to stay perfectly still (typically robots, aliens, programs) do not register unless they moved last turn.
* Narcolepsy
: Provided by narcoleptor which is an [[amulet of restful sleep]] by another name.
* Night vision
: Wearing pair of night vision goggles allows to see monsters in [[unlit]] places. It does not do anything else.
* Peril sensing
: Another intrinsic brought by only a single item in game - the pair of peril-sensitive sunglasses. Whenever your character is in any situation in peril, which is defined as any monster or trap existing in your view, your glasses will darken in effort to prevent you from seeing anything that could upset you. Note that trap condition is triggered regardless whether it is known to you or not - this is intentionally exploitable.
: If one has X-ray vision then nonetheless one can still see the surroundings.
* Radiation detection
: Carrying active Geiger counter will give clicking messages when radiation intensity changes.
* Radiation processing
: Significantly speeds up treatment of radiation intake which happens very slowly naturally. Granted by radiation processor.
* [[Reflection]]
: Causes laser damage attacks to bounce off without dealing any harm, possibly hitting other targets or the attacker itself. Granted by wearing brain shield, suit of reflec armor of wielding light saber. Since laser damage is common in ZAPM this is very useful.
* Shielded
: Can be gained by wearing shield belt and Daleks have it "naturally". While it is active any energy sources you have will be used for absorbing damage on point for point basis.
* Telepathic
: Allows to sense monsters with minds within a certain distance. Unlike NetHack [[telepathy]] it does not require being blind to take advantage of. Activate a mutant power to get this intrinsic.
* Translation
: A babel fish will translate "beeps and chirps" used by robots into human language.  In practical terms, this will pre-identify docbot services, and clerkbots will type-ID items you buy with a 50% chance.
* X-ray vision
: Wearing pair of X-ray goggles or activating appropriate mutant power enables sight through walls and other solid objects, including some worn ones.

</pre>


There are four branches in ZAPM. These are: the Space Base, the Gamma Caves, the Sewers and the Mainframe.

There are also three special locations.
* Robot Town is placed at eight level of the Base. There you may continue down or enter the Sewers.
* Rabbit Hole is just below the last Space Base level. It contains boss monster and entrance to the Mainframe.
* Sewer Plant is at the end of Sewers. It contains guaranteed radiation suit and power plant.

=== Space Base ===
You start every game at the Space Base which is 12 levels deep. It is the only place vats of sludge are generated and new monsters are spawned according to player character level and depth just like in NetHack. Each level except the first and Robot Town may contain a single shop.

==== Robot Town ====
Robot Town is protected by guardbot asking for a toll of 300 buckazoids. There are three guaranteed shops, hospital with docbot and three sludge vats. The stores are always hardware store, software store and general store. The town is initially populated with bots and droids. Any spawned creature has only one third chance not to be robotic. Robot Town is the perfect location for your main stash.

==== Rabbit Hole ====
It is a rectangular room with a retina scanner door on one end. No monsters spawn on this level except for the killer rabbit. To pass the door one has to be very good at lock picking or have the Eye of the BOFH artifact equipped.

=== Sewers ===
Sewers are filled with foul stench which will make the hero sickened unless he wears a helmet granting air filtering. Being sickened suppresses natural hit points regeneration and may quickly lead to death. Monsters spawned in sewers are mutants, insects, vermin, oozes and aberrations. As an exception ratbots also may appear. There are five sewer levels. Each has a 50% chance of being unlit.

==== Sewer Plant ====
In the Plant is a guaranteed fusion power plant and a radiation suit. There is also a garbage compactor with many random items, but stepping inside triggers the mechanism giving very limited time to loot and escape. Getting squished by the moving walls is an instant death. The walls push all items towards the center and finally crush everything. This means you only get one chance to pick everything up. A canister of speed is invaluable here. There is also a fake Orgasmatron, which nevertheless sells for quite a bit of money (100K, but no clerkbot has that much).

=== Gamma Caves ===
The Caves are dangerous because of constant background radiation. It is necessary to have some means of dealing with this threat while wandering through this location. Radiation suit suffices, so does radiation processor. Monsters present here are oozes, aliens, aberrations, insects, mutants, eggs, beasts and half as likely bots. Two third cavern levels are unlit.

On the sixth and last level of Gamma Caves resides Bastard Operator from Hell. Among his possessions he carries a computer and floppy disks of which one is guaranteed to be cracked. His artifact Eye of the BOFH grants passage to the Mainframe.

=== Mainframe ===
Final area of the game, random maze containing only program type monsters. The most dangerous of these are Unix Daemons represented by 'U' character. On the top (because this location is ascending like the [[Wizard's Tower]]) lies the Bizarro Orgasmatron, the goal of the game. Unlike NetHack one has just to use it in order to win ZAPM. Note that the Bizarro Orgasmatron only exists in the top level of the Mainframe; there are, however, various devices scattered throughout all three levels of the area that are misspellings of "Bizarro Orgasmatron", such as the "Bizaaro Orgasmatron" and the "Bazaaro Orgasmatron", which will produce messages with no effect when used. "Bizarre Orgasmatron" is only one fake item with an actual effect besides message - it teleports player randomly for 15 energy.

In the Mainframe teleportation is imprecise. Character typically lands a few squares off the mark.

==Strategy Notes==

=== General Strategy ===

The Space Marine role is the ZAPM equivalent of the Dwarvish Valkyrie, being strong enough and having enough starting resources to get through the early game. 

Resource management is important.  Ammunition should be saved until needed; if you don't have a melee weapon yet you can hit things with the butt of your rifle (or whatever) which is enough to take out the weaker monsters.  Energy cells are also precious.  Try to get your hands on a couple of power plants as soon as you can.  It's a good idea to have a "badass" projectile weapon (e.g., pulse rifle) and an energy weapon (e.g., laser cannon) so you can alternate them according to what resources you have.

There are numerous hidden closets which often contain loot scattered throughout the Space Base.  It's worth searching blank walls and training the search and spot skills to find them.

Locked doors can be shot (at point blank range) or kicked down (but watch your hit points). They can be unlocked using a matching keycard.  If you find a lockpick consider training lock picking skill, but don't bother unless you have one as they are rare.  A purple keycard is a master key - apply it to a locked door and you will subsequently be prompted to use it for all regular doors.

Shooting or kicking doors or picking locks has a chance of sounding an alarm, which causes a party of redshirts, stormtroopers or troubleshooters to appear somewhere on the level.  

A computer is essential equipment; you can't use floppy disks without one.  There are two kinds: mega (1000 buckazoids) and mini (500 buckazoids.)  If you find one in a shop but can't afford it, you can use it in the shop with no penalty.  There will usually be at least one computer in one of the shops in Robot Town.

Reflection is very useful, and reflec suits (shiny armor) will usually be found pretty early.  A light saber (energy sword) also grants reflection when wielded, which is slightly better than the suit, as it also deflects energy weapons, but it will burn floppies in your enemies' possession, depriving you of loot. On the other hand most tough mid-game monsters (ninjas, pink horrors, aliens) don't have laser weapons, here raw AC counts more. Flak jackets can be found early, too, and are common enough to offer a decent chance of stumbling upon an enhanced one.

With reflection and a way of dealing decent damage, the guardbot in robot town is beatable if you want to save the 300 bucks admission fee.  Bear in mind that he might have a nasty ray gun in addition to his laser cannon.  If you refuse to pay, he won't actually get angry until you walk past him without paying.  Of course he'll also get angry if you attack him.  You'll want to keep the laser cannon.

Clerkbots are not hard to kill if you have reflection and a way of dealing decent damage.  They provide you with a lot of buckazoids.  These can be used to purchase medical treatment.  On the other hand clerkbots allow price-IDing, and often they even outright identify items bought from them once you understand what they're saying. And if you just sell all useless loot to them you have enough money to buy everything you want.

You need a stormtrooper helmet or, even better, a space helmet in order to regenerate health in the sewers.  Usually you'll find one before Robot Town.

Radiation exposure management is key.  Radiation Sickness is delayed instadeath.  You can be exposed to radiation by carrying canisters of mutagen or gamma ray guns, being in radiated rooms or in Gamma Caves or triggering radiation traps.  The [http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=PRIME/Radiation PRIME Radiation spoiler] is worth reading; it is accurate for ZAPM except for a few minor details. In short, you will need either a radiation processor or a radiation suit eventually. The latter is easy to price-ID. Until then a geiger counter can at least prevent you from choosing a radiated room as your base camp location or lugging an unidentified mutagen canister around for hours.

Ray guns will always self-identify by zapping.  Some have good effects like healing or restoration.

A babel fish (yellow fish) lets you understand what the bots are saying.  This is most useful in the infirmary and in shops, but of limited use elsewhere.  They still work if buggy, so if you find one there's no downside to implanting it.  Lacking a babel fish, tame a protocol droid.

Price ID is of limited use.  Sell prices are always 1/10 of base price; buy prices are always base price.  Charisma doesn't modify prices.  Floppy Disks of Identify are 25 buckazoids; so are Floppy Disks of Spam.  Drop your money before use-test (it's okay to drop currency in a shop.)

=== Buggy Armor ===

How do I remove buggy armor...?

* execute a floppy of debugging
* execute a non-buggy floppy of enhance armor (make sure to take off other gear first!)

=== Impregnation (alien infestation) ===

There is limited time from when a facehugger impregnates you to when you will die from giving birth to an alien.  Here are some ways to heal alien infestation:

* Visit the docbot in the town, get intestinal examination. Makes you sore.
* Quaff napalm, universal solvent, plasma, liquid nitrogen, or poison. Also gives unwanted effects.
* Quaff a vat of acid (chance)

=== Tribble ===

If you find a tribble, don't kill it. let it reproduce and farm XP from it. It'll get you at least to XP level 10 if you're patient (and don't let yourself get surrounded).

=== Monolith ===

If you find a monolith, don't kill it. "Attack" it bare-handed. Most of the time it shall frighten you, but it'll give you a free XP level eventually, then disappear. Because it frightens you, don't attempt the free XP around monsters that can kill you.

=== Strength Drain (from poison) ===

Docbots can heal strength drain.
