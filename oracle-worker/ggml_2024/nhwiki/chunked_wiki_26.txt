==Strategy==
===Character creation===
A common early-game goal for a Healer is to run the [[protection racket]] and reach [[Minetown]] while gaining as few [[experience level]]s as possible; a gnomish Healer's relatively peaceful [[Mines]] and [[infravision]] make this goal significantly easier to achieve. Conversely, a human Healer has a much harder Mines, but can reach the maximum [[strength]] bonus without wearing [[gauntlets of power]], which impose a significant [[spellcasting]] penalty unless they also wear a [[robe]].

===Early game===
====Objectives====
Because healers start with a large quantity of [[zorkmid]]s, they can buy [[protection]] from the Minetown [[temple]] [[Aligned priest|priest]], with the amount potentially increased by [[credit cloning]] beforehand. A skilled (or lucky) gnomish Healer can reach Minetown’s temple without landing a single blow. Healers are also best suited for the [[pacifist]] [[conduct]].

Although healers have excellent [[HP]] growth, their initially poor fighting skills make the very early game quite difficult for most players. However, due to their starting equipment, a Healer should not be completely afraid of combat; the stethoscope is a good way to read an enemy's HP and gauge whether to fight, flee, or simply fall back a bit. The starting money can also be used to buy solid weapons and armor if you are lucky enough to happen upon an early shop that sells them.

A good strategy (if not going for the [[protection racket]] or [[atheist]] conduct) is to fight until somewhat damaged after turn 300, then [[pray]]. You will then be healed with a boost to your max HP from your god. Another very early game strategy is to immediately quaff your [[potion of extra healing|potions of extra healing]], which will boost your maximum by 2 (5 for blessed potions).

====Weapons====
Healers are restricted in most weapon skills. Your starting scalpel is equivalent to a rustproof, half-weight [[orcish dagger]] and is not a particularly good weapon. As your melee weapon, you could upgrade to a [[short sword]], [[aklys]], [[dagger]], or [[elven dagger]] - all of which have better average damage versus small monsters.

For ranged weapons, a Healer has four options: [[knives]], [[darts]], [[daggers]], and the aklys. Knives are easily trained with your starting scalpel and can be advanced to Expert, making them the only ranged weapon that Healers can [[multishot]] 3 of. However, the base damage for a knife is low, and knives are unlikely to be generated in large quantities; monsters such as [[soldiers]], [[barrow wight]]s, [[Mordor orc]]s, and [[orc captains]] can all carry knives, but it could take awhile to put together a reasonable stack.

Darts and daggers are far more plentiful: darts can be [[potion of sickness|poisoned]], and the skill can be advanced to Expert, but they have the same low base damage as knives and are breakable. Daggers are reusable and deal slightly more damage, but are heavier, cannot be poisoned, and are capped at Skilled level. The aklys tends to be the best option of the set - it is plentiful early in the [[Gnomish Mines]] due to the strength restrictions of the resident gnomes. It can be tethered and thrown as a re-usable weapon, and should train up quickly to Skilled since it can double as a melee weapon.

An unusual technique for training your Healer's skills is to find a [[gas spore]] with sufficient HP, maneuver it into a corridor, and hit it with your unskilled weapon. Apply your starting [[stethoscope]] to see when its hit points are close to zero, then cast your {{spell of|healing}} spell at the gas spore before you resume attacking. Be very careful when training a skill this way - a gas spore's explosion frequently wipes out a low-level Healer.

====Spellcasting====
At experience level 3, Healers can reliably cast [[stone to flesh]], which can convert boulders into huge chunks of meat. This alleviates the threat of starvation, allowing players to act slower and more cautiously. Eating a huge chunk of meat while not Satiated will generally result in being "[[oversatiated]]" - as this specific state is still displayed on the status line as "Satiated", it may be best to avoid eating anything until your nutrition returns to normal, lest you risk a death by choking (unless you are wearing an [[amulet of life saving]] or [[amulet of magical breathing|magical breathing]]). The spell can also be used to remove troublesome boulders from passageways.

A [[pet]] is probably the Healer's best aid in developing their [[spellcasting]] skills: due to the role's low fighting skills, it may quickly surpass the player in terms of damage output. Regularly monitoring and healing a pet both trains the skill and ensures its survival against particularly troublesome foes. Stone to flesh can convert rocks into meatballs, which can be used to tame carnivorous domestic pets and serve as treats to train their [[apport]].

====Armor====
Applying the starting stethoscope to a monster will reveal its armor class, which in turn will give some idea of whether it has any enchanted armor. For example, if a dwarf in the Gnomish Mines has AC 4 or less, it probably has either a [[dwarvish mithril-coat]] or at least one enchanted piece of armor.

While early metallic armor can interfere with your casting success in a pinch, remember that you can always retreat to a relatively safer area to remove the armor and heal yourself or your pet(s). In addition, all but one of the [[emergency spell]]s are in the healing school, and Healers are the only role to get a +3 bonus towards successful casting of emergency spells. [[Gauntlets of power]] may be especially worthwhile, since they provide such a huge boost to damage and survivability for an early Healer.

===Mid game===
====Objectives====
The [[Healer quest]] has a large number of dragons - thus makes it a dangerous place to visit without [[reflection]], particularly if there are any [[black dragon]]s with [[disintegration]] [[breath]]. The abundance of [[moat|water]] also makes crossing difficult if you have not obtained a reliable means to do so. For this reason, it may be best to get the [[Castle]] wand prior to attempting the Quest. That said, if you are capable of dispatching dragons, one of them may leave behind [[dragon scales]] which can be enchanted into [[dragon scale mail]].

The Healer's [[quest nemesis]], the [[Cyclops]], can be incredibly tough; it is unwise to melee him while he is wielding the [[Staff of Aesculapius]], and the [[wand of lightning]] that generates on his starting square is dangerous as well. Fortunately, the Cyclops respects [[Elbereth]] and the [[scroll of scare monster]] and has low monster magic resistance, making him especially vulnerable to wands of death or wands of sleep (which Healers always start with) if they can hit through his AC.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any [[unique]] monster.}}

====Weapons====
Healers should consider switching to a [[unicorn horn]], which can be trained to Expert skill, and, after the Quest, the Staff of Aesculapius. The Staff itself does double damage to monsters without [[drain resistance]], and has additional [[life drain]]ing powers similar to [[Stormbringer]] (though without being [[bloodthirsty]]). Healers may also generally find it useful to conserve skill slots, e.g. by not advancing their unicorn horn skill to Expert and leaving the slot free for the Staff later.

====Spellcasting====
Long-term spellcasting for Healers is somewhat idiosyncratic. Although they have great natural spellcasting ability, they are restricted in all spell schools except [[healing spells|healing]], resulting in difficulty casting level 3 or higher spells. Level 2 spells such as {{spell of|magic missile}} can still be of significant use.

===Late game===
====Weapons====
Some players prefer using a [[silver]] weapon within [[Gehennom]] - for those sticking with their quest artifact, a silver weapon in the hands of a suitable pet can compensate for the lower damage output, as most of Gehennom's residents are drain resistant, and the Staff's hungerless regeneration and other properties are valuable for survival. Other good non-silver weapons include [[Magicbane]] or a highly-enchanted [[crysknife]].

====Spellcasting====
Because of their low base spellcasting penalty, Healers can wear metal boots and cast reliably, or wear a metal helm and cast with a failure rate of ~3%. When casting emergency spells, Healers can even wear gauntlets of power and still have 0% failure rates.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], Healers have a guaranteed first sacrifice gift: [[Mirrorbright]], an artifact [[shield of reflection]] that grants [[hallucination resistance]].  This makes it more difficult for Healers to obtain an artifact weapon through sacrifice.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], quarterstaves give Healers a bonus to spellcasting success rates like a [[robe]], and a cursed staff doesn't prevent them from casting spells, making it safer to wield their quest artifact. Additionally, their d5/d7 [[scalpel]] is a better starting weapon.

===FIQHack===
In addition to similar staff bonuses as with xNetHack, healers in [[FIQHack]] have a health regeneration bonus of 0.33 HP per turn.

'''Silver dragon scale mail''', or '''SDSM''', gives you [[reflection]] in addition to its considerable [[AC]]. Because of this, some players try to [[wish]] for it as soon as possible.  In fact, many players [[GDSM versus SDSM|consider it a good first wish]].

Silver dragon scale mail can be produced from [[silver dragon scales]], which might be dropped by a [[silver dragon]].

&&%s&& %s Dogley Dimension {147725 2022-08-20T10:36:29Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} lmao this was probably the longest Dudley's dungeon article anywhere on the wiki In ''[[Dudley's dungeon]]'', The '''Dogley Dimension''' is the space between adjacent [[dungeon level]]s. It was first presented in the [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20060512 12 May 2006 strip] of the webcomic.

Its discoverer, the [[dog]] called [[Dogley]], describes the Dogley Dimension as "the infinite void between dungeon levels" which "does not occupy the same spatial dimensions as the [[dungeon]]". As with many other [[spoiler]]s, the Dogley Dimension was discovered using [[wizard mode]].

== The basic concept ==
The existence of the Dogley Dimension explains why holes in the dungeon [[floor]] transport one to a ''random'' place on the next level. Any objects here will fall to a random position on the next level as they move back into the normal dimension.

It also explains the generation of [[monster]]s; the [[hash mark|#]] symbols that float around sometimes collide and form random monsters, which then fall to a random location. Dogley explains that the [[Wizard of Yendor]] uses wormholes through the Dogley Dimension to connect [[staircase]]s.

Of course, that leaves two problems:
* [[Dogley]] reached the Dogley Dimension by [[level teleport|level-teleporting]] to level 4.5 in [[wizard mode]]. Then why did Dogley not immediately fall to level 5, as all other monsters seem to do?
* Why are we naming this after Dogley anyway, if the Wizard of Yendor already knew of this dimension?

== Additional speculations and theories ==
Use this section of the article to add and edit speculations and theories about the Dogley Dimension, beyond what was presented in ''Dudley's dungeon''. Of course, if this section contradicts something later revealed in the webcomic, someone might have to come here and fix it.

=== Orc multiplication effect ===
When the [[hash mark|#]] symbols collide, they can create any random monster, including an [[orc]]. However, orcs tend to appear on the level in groups.

The actual explanation for this is a special type of collision called the ''orc multiplication effect''. This produces large groups of orcs of the same type. The orcs appear on one square and fall together, being distributed across adjacent squares as they land in the dungeon.

The normal, single-monster method of generation can still produce single orcs, which is why you occasionally find orcs alone. The orc multiplication effect is most likely a consequence of the effect's preferences for monsters of the round shape that orcs have.

A related effect is the ''shrieker effect''. The creation of a [[shrieker]] leaves residue that sometimes interacts with other [[hash mark|#]] symbols to create a [[purple worm]], which has a round shape similar to orcs. The purple worm appears sometime after the [[shrieker]] on the same level. The shrieks of a shrieker resonate with the purple worm because both monsters were created from similar material. A shrieker does not always leave residue, which is why some shriekers will shriek and shriek but the purple worm will never appear.

=== Wormhole redirection ===
Normally, wormholes connect the down [[staircase]] of one level with the up staircase of the level immediately below. However, in theory, it is possible to redirect these wormholes between arbitrary staircases using an [[artifact]] known as the "[[w:c:stargate:Dial Home Device|Dial Home Device]]", for example to jump from [[Minetown]] to the [[Oracle]] level.

In fact, the wormholes of up staircases ''are'' occasionally redirected to other than the staircase immediately above. This may happen if you possess the [[Amulet of Yendor]] and are in the [[Gehennom]]. That is why sometimes, when you try to ascend, you will just find that you have descended a level or two.

The reason why you never hear about this is because it is much easier to [[teleport]] while [[confused]]. Also, you cannot create a new wormhole without closing the existing ones, and no one has found a way to close the existing wormholes.

== Conclusion ==
Upon closer inspection, maybe [[you]] do not believe in the Dogley Dimension. Maybe you believe that [[Dogley]] simply found a [[wand]] of draw [[ASCII]] webcomic. Maybe we should stop imagining things and pretend that the dungeon is literally made from letters and punctuation.

However, wherever the theory of the Dogley Dimension falls short, there is ''always'' some special exception or additional rule to save it.

* {{monsymlink|silver dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|red dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|white dragon}}

** {{monsymlink|Ixoth}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Gold (and baby gold) dragons are added. They emit light and breathe fire. Main details should go on [[Gold dragon]].}}

[[Deferred feature|Deferred monsters]] in the dragon class are:

* {{monsymlink|shimmering dragon}}
* {{monsymlink|baby shimmering dragon}}

==Common characteristics==
All dragons are carnivorous monsters that are thick-skinned, capable of [[flight]], and are eligible [[steed]]s. They are generally slower than an unburdened, unhasted [[hero]]. Dragons generated randomly and at level creation will always be hostile, and are eligible polyforms for [[polymorph trap]]s and other sources of [[polymorph]].

Dragons are [[intelligent]] and [[gold lover|can pick up gold]] and gems, but lack defined hands (the default tiles depict them as quadrupedal), and thus cannot use any items they come across or happen to be carrying, e.g. after transformation via [[polymorph trap]].

===Adult dragons===
All adult dragons are either lawful or chaotic, with an [[AC]] of -1 and an MR of 20. They are [[strong]], gigantic, [[oviparous]], can [[see invisible]], and have the <code>[[M2_NASTY]]</code> flag; an associated bit of code in trap.c allows them to instantly tear through webs where their baby forms cannot.{{refsrc|trap.c|2543|comment=extra_nasty() discerns adult dragons from baby dragons to let them tear through webs|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} All adult dragons possess a breath weapon of [[#Elemental affinities|an element]] corresponding to their color. In addition to [[zorkmids|gold]] and gems, dragons will pick up magical items such as [[wand]]s and [[scroll]]s, but the aforementioned lack of hands and their inability to speak prevents them from using any of their spoils.

===Baby dragons===
All baby dragons are of neutral alignment, with an AC of 2 and an MR of 10. They are strong and huge, but lack the adult dragon's ability to use breath weapons, tear through webs, and see invisible. Baby dragons can [[grow up]] into their adult forms, which causes their scales to grow in (hence the AC difference of 3 between their forms).

===Death drops===
Dragons will always leave a [[corpse]] if killed in a way that leaves it intact, and adults have a 1 in 3 chance of also dropping a set of their uncursed +0 scales (1 in 20 if the dragon was [[revive]]d); baby dragons do not drop scales, nor do their corpses grant intrinsics. Adult dragon corpses that grant intrinsics are guaranteed to do so.

===Generation===
Baby dragons, like all baby monsters, are randomly generated only on levels that are eligible for baby monsters, e.g., aligned branches like the neutral-biased [[Oracle]] and [[Sokoban]] levels. Thus they are usually excluded from monster generation on level creation that calls for a {{white|D}} unless it specifically generates a baby dragon. Baby dragons can also be hatched from dragon [[egg]]s.

Adult dragons are first eligible to be generated through normal random [[monster creation]] around the midway depths of the dungeon. They are also considered [[throne room]] monsters, and can be generated in throne rooms on level creation or when a [[throne]] is [[loot]]ed as early as dungeon level 15.{{reffunc|mkroom.c|courtmon}} Adult dragons are all eligible for creation via the [[summon nasties]] [[monster spell]] when cast by a spellcaster of the same alignment.

Where most monsters roll (ML)d8 for their HP - with ML being the monster's level - an adult dragon instead rolls (ML)d4 and adds 4 times its monster level to that result, e.g., a level 15 dragon will always have at least 75 HP. Dragons generated in the [[End Game]] use a flat 8*(ML), and so will always have the maximum amount of HP possible for their level (e.g., the level 15 dragon from before would always have 120 HP if generated there).{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|969|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

In addition to random generation, adult dragons are generated on level creation for the following areas:

* Four dragons are generated around the [[moat]] of [[Fort Ludios]], with one random dragon placed at each cardinal direction.

* Many dragons appear on the [[Healer quest]] - five random dragons are generated for the home, locate and goal levels, and four random dragons are generated in the filler levels between them.

* Four dragons are guaranteed to appear in the [[Castle]], with two random dragons occupying each of the alcoves between the storerooms.

* Three random dragons will be generated upon reaching the [[Astral Plane]].

===Quest nemeses===
Two dragons serve as [[quest nemeses]] in the game: the {{monsymlink|Chromatic Dragon}}, the [[Caveman]] [[quest nemesis]], and {{monsymlink|Ixoth}}, the [[Knight]] quest nemesis. Neither of them leave behind any scales upon death. 

Ixoth is a powerful red dragon and thus possesses the standard fire breath alongside many other abilities - eating him conveys [[fire resistance]].

The Chromatic Dragon is a special kind of dragon - she possesses the breath weapon of every single dragon in the game, and eating her corpse conveys a random resistance from the ones availble via adult dragon meat. Her corpse is [[poison]]ous to eat, however.

==Elemental affinities==
Each adult dragon has a specific element-and-resistance set of characteristic associated with it, including a [[breath]] attack. Eating a given dragon's [[corpse]] can give you the associated [[intrinsics]] if possible, while the scales (and any mail made from them) will grant the extrinsic characteristic.

==Deferred dragons==
The shimmering dragon, whose scales grant [[displacement]], appears in the code along with its baby form, but is commented out by default - monster displacement has [[deferred features|not yet been implemented]] in vanilla ''NetHack''. However, variants make used of them, such as [[shimmering dragon (SLASH'EM)|SLASH'EM]].

Baby dragons generally possess the resistances of their adult forms. However, baby silver dragons do not possess reflection, which is provided by the adult's scales.{{refsrc|muse.c|2156|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} They grant no intrinsics when eaten, they do not drop scales, and they do not have breath attacks. 

==Strategy==
While baby dragons may not be especially difficult due to being held back by their lesser defenses and only having a single bite attack, adult dragons are somewhat fearsome foes - the value of their scales and the frequency at which they start appearing from the midgame on make them threats that every player must eventually prepare for.

===Combat===
Dragons will use their breath weapons only at range (i.e., more than one square from the character) - players that get within melee distance can avoid the breath attacks, but will have to contend with their powerful bite and subsequent claw attacks. Characters without magic cancellation, magic resistance, or reflection to avoid or negate the breath's rays may prefer this option, and good AC is almost a must in any case.

Dragons are considered [[kebabable]], granting a +2 [[to-hit]] bonus when attacking them with weapons that use the [[spear]] skill. In addition, [[Dragonbane]] deals double damage to all dragons, and the reflection it grants when wielded is perfect for dealing with their breath attacks - thus it is especially useful when farming for scales. Those looking to make dragon scale mail may opt to use a [[cursed]] [[scroll of genocide]] to generate dragons of their desired color, which is best done in conjunction with an engraved [[Elbereth]] or [[scroll of scare monster]]; it is wisest to attempt this in a smaller room to reduce the chances of breath attacks occurring.

===As pets===
Dragons are excellent pets in the early game if you obtain one. The easiest way to get a dragon pet is through a dragon [[egg]]; the egg may be obtained by polymorphing into any of the dragons and then [[sit]]ting if your character is female. If you repeatedly displace your pet onto a [[polymorph trap]] you will occasionally end up with a gray dragon, since they are magic-resistant and will not polymorph further.

The most recommendable colors for adult dragons are silver and gray, as both are immune to [[death ray]]s; silver dragons are also immune to [[disintegration]] breath, while gray ones are immune to [[polymorph trap]]s. Yellow is a good option too, due to [[stoning]] resistance.

Pet dragons can be used as steeds with the advantages of flight, fighting strength, and preference for meaty corpses, which makes them easy to feed. However, their lack of speed ensures they will spend most of their time either catching up with you or eating said corpses; even after making them [[fast]] (e.g., by zapping a [[wand of speed monster]] at them), their movement speed still pales in comparison to many other available steeds, though the flight and breath weapon may still make them a worthwhile choice. Players making use of dragon pets or steeds may want to carry a [[magic whistle]].

While baby dragons lack scales and intrinsic resistances, one can still use tame baby dragons to obtain scales and/or resistances. Pet baby dragons will eventually [[grow up]] into their adult forms, which can then be killed (possibly via [[conflict]] or by rendering them non-tame through [[abuse]]) for their scales and intrinsics.

Obtaining pet baby dragons can be accomplished via controlled [[polymorph]] for a female character fairly easily: all dragons are [[oviparous]], and baby dragons coming from laid eggs will be tame. A male character can use an [[amulet of change]] to swap genders - if one is not available, he can also repeatedly polymorph into a dragon using the [[spellbook of polymorph|spell]] or the [[ring of polymorph|ring]] until he changes sex. This has a 10% chance to occur with each polymorph.{{refsrc|polyself.c|292|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|polyself.c|467|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

===Intrinsics and food sources===
Dragon corpses are very high-[[nutrition]] and filling, and eating after being satiated abuses your [[wisdom]] if you are lawful. Using a [[tinning kit]] is preferred if you plan to chew through several servings of dragon in a short time. Most dragons are also among the relatively few monsters in ''NetHack'' that are guaranteed to confer an intrinsic, so they are also worth tinning as backup sources of those intrinsics in case they are lost (e.g., to a [[gremlin]] [[Intrinsic theft|attack]] at [[night]]).

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}
The dragon is a large, serpentine, legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons and dragon-like beings vary considerably through regions, but dragons in European cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons and similar creatures in various Asiatic cultures - such as the Chinese ''lung'' (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, Japanese simplified 竜, Pinyin lóng) associated with good fortune and thought to have power over rain - are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence; they are also typically more benevolent compared to the European dragon, and many East Asian deities and demigods have such creatures as their personal mounts or companions. Other common traits of dragons often include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth. 

The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures occur in the mythologies of the ancient Near East, particularly in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature; stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies, such as that of [[Marduk]] and [[Tiamat]]. Other famous prototypical draconic creatures include the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; the Grand'Goule in the Poitou region of France; and Python, Wyvern, and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology. [[#Variants|Variants]] such as [[SLASH'EM]] and [[UnNetHack]] along with some patches have made use of these and other names for draconian creatures, as explored in detail below.

The Western dragon's image is based on a conflation of earlier dragons and giant serpents from different traditions, mixed with inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes; according to several modern scholars, huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear that lived in forested or swampy areas were likely a template for modern dragon imagery. These dragons are generally depicted as cave-dwellers and [[Gold lover|treasure-hoarders]] with ravenous appetites, and are a frequent fixture of Western fantasy literature where they are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome by saints or culture heroes, such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Hobbit'' and the popular legend of Saint George and the Dragon.

==History==
[[Hack 1.0]] has the standard '''dragon''', which does not have an explicit color. This early dragon breathes fire and its corpse confers [[fire resistance]], making it equivalent to the modern red dragon. A dead dragon is the only way to get intrinsic fire resistance in ''Hack'', so it was quite likely that the player wouldn't have acquired it yet by the time they would see one. This, combined with the ability to use their breath attack in melee ''on top'' of their normal melee attacks, made them significantly more dangerous; furthermore, reflection would not be introduced until much later. Such would remain true for thee earlier versions of NetHack.

[[NetHack 2.3e]] introduces all of the modern dragon types and their associated breath weapons, except for silver. The corpse is still referred to as a "dead dragon" regardless of type, and eating it always confers fire resistance. Black dragon breath causes [[instadeath]], and there is no reflection, [[disintegration resistance]], or [[amulet of life saving]], making genocide tempting - but fire resistance is necessary to traverse [[Hell]], and there is no method of genociding only black dragons.

[[NetHack 3.0.0]] introduces baby dragons, distinguishes the dragons and their corpses by type, and also introduces dragon scale mail; in this series, dragon scale mail is obtained by [[polymorph]]ing a dragon corpse. Reflection is introduced in this version, and black dragon breath is toned down a bit. The changes to how dragons are distinguished also makes it possible to genocide only black dragons.

[[NetHack 3.1.0]] introduces dragon scales as a death drop and the current method of obtaining dragon scale mail. This version also adds the [[Quest]]s, and with them the Chromatic Dragon and Ixoth. Hell is replaced by [[Gehennom]] in this version, and fire resistance is no longer necessary to enter (though it is still heavily recommended).

[[NetHack 3.3.0]] adds the silver dragon along with its corresponding baby form and scales from [[3.1.3]] variant [[SLASH 6]].

==Variants==
Variants of ''NetHack'' often subject dragons to extensive changes, as well as adding new monsters to the class. The deferred shimmering dragon is one such frequent addition.

===UnNetHack===
Dragons have been substantially modified in [[UnNetHack]]. All dragons have been given new names and have their breaths, resistances, and colors randomized - with the exception of [[chromatic dragons]], which possess the resistances and breath weapons of all dragons. As a result, it is impossible to predict breath type based on name or color.

This randomization happens at the start of the game, but all dragons of the same name or color within a game are of the same type - dragons are auto-identified upon witnessing their breath attack, and identifying one dragon also identifies all dragons of that type. In addition, a new type of breath attack has been added - lava breath that does heavy fire damage and melts walls instead of bouncing. 

[[Glowing dragon]] scales and scale mail function as an infinite light source, in addition to providing the resistance that glowing dragons possess in that individual game. [[Chromatic dragon scales]] and [[Chromatic dragon scale mail|scale mail]] provide all dragons' resistances, including reflection.

The following are the names given to random dragons in UnNetHack:

* leviathan
* tatzelworm
* lindworm
* guivre
* sarkany
* amphitere
* wyvern
* draken
* sirrush
* glowing dragon

===SLASH'EM===
{{main|Dragon (SLASH'EM)}}
SLASH'EM adds two new colored dragons: the formerly deferred shimmering dragon {{cyan|D}} and the deep dragon {{magenta|D}}, whose scales give [[displacement]] and [[drain resistance]], respectively. The [[hydra]] and [[wyvern]] are two other new additions to the monster class, and SLASH'EM dragons in general undergo a few additional changes that distinguish them from the dragons of ''NetHack''.

===SlashTHEM===
SlashTHEM adds two new colored dragons: the golden dragon {{yellow|D}} and the stone dragon {{gray|D}}, whose scales give [[sickness resistance]] and [[petrification resistance]] respectively. Additionally, SlashTHEM adds a new unique dragon called the [[Dragon Lord]] located in [[The Wyrm Caves]], who drops the artifact [[Scales of the Dragon Lord]] on death.

===Biodiversity patch===
The [[biodiversity patch]] [[Biodiversity patch#Changes to existing monsters|renames the vanilla dragons]] (minus the gray dragon) in a manner similar to UnNetHack, but does not randomize their traits.

===FIQHack===
[[FIQHack]] dragons are significantly faster (speed 20 instead of 9), and their claw attacks are 1d8 instead of 1d4. In addition, they have special AI that allows them to use their breath weapon in melee range, and they will try to move more intelligently in general: they will keep you in their line of fire when possible, or move out of that line when they can't use their breath, and will flee to preserve survival.

FIQHack also includes the deferred shimmering dragons from vanilla, which have innate [[displacement]] and stunning breath, and whose scales confer displacement when worn.

Dragon breaths operate as [[Wands Balance Patch|skilled ray-type wands]]: there is a chance per breath attack that it will bypass reflection.  Disintegration breath never does this.

===SpliceHack===
{{main|Dragon (SpliceHack)}}
SpliceHack adds several new dragon flavours and new dragon special abilities. Older dragons gain increasingly powerful breath weapons.

===EvilHack===
[[EvilHack]] dragons have been significantly enhanced – they spawn with much more hit points (especially in the End Game), can [[engulf]] and [[digest]] creatures smaller than them, and their scales each have some form of a secondary passive attack (which is passed on to the scales and any mail made out of them).

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail, the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
{{right-align|[ Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]}}

"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's not a trick of mastering the dragons, as most people think. Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with a dragon:  will he talk to you or will he eat you?  If you can count upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why then you're a dragonlord."

&&%s&& %s Text adventure {49686 2010-06-09T23:30:14Z {749 Slandor} linked IFWiki; indicated a couple of descriptions that don't apply to most modern IF A '''text adventure''' (or "interactive fiction") is the type of game commonly found on computer servers before someone had the idea to draw a map in [[ASCII]] characters, thus creating the [[roguelike]] games including ''[[NetHack]]''.

As the NetHack [[Guidebook]] explains it:

: ''When NetHack's ancestor ''[http://roguebasin.t-o-m-e.net/index.php/Rogue rogue]'' first appeared, its screen orientation was almost unique among computer fantasy games. Since then, screen orientation has become the norm rather than the exception; NetHack continues this fine tradition. Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen.''
:: From [http://www.nethack.org/v343/Guidebook.html#_TOCentry_3 Chapter 3, "What do all those things on the screen mean?"]

For an example of what a text adventure game would be like, see the [http://www.nicolaas.net/dudley/index.php?f=20050308 strip of 8 March 2005] in ''[[Dudley's dungeon]]''. Or you can read the demonstration in the next section.

There is another [http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page wiki] devoted entirely to text adventures/interactive fiction. As NetHack has changed since the days of Rogue, text adventures have changed since the olden days.

=== Demonstration (spoily) ===
The text editor ''[[Wikipedia:Emacs|GNU Emacs]]'' contains a text adventure called ''dunnet'', written by Ron Schnell. This section features a sample session of dunnet to see what a text adventure is like.

'''[[spoiler|Spoiler warning]]:''' ''The following demonstration contains plot spoilers for the text adventure "dunnet". '''If you do not want "dunnet" spoiled, do not read below this point.'''''

Okay, since you feel okay with having the beginning of "dunnet" spoiled, let us go to a [[Unix]] machine with "emacs" installed and run the usual command to start "dunnet":

 $ '''emacs -batch -l dunnet'''

Now the game starts:

 Dead end
 You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
 In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
 trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
 from each other.
 There is a shovel here.
 >

Okay. It is a text adventure, so instead of having an ASCII map, you must read through the description of an area. The name of this place is "Dead end", while "There is a shovel here." is the usual way to indicate the presence of some [[item]], and substitutes for the <tt>(</tt> symbol in NetHack.

Commands in text adventures are similar to English; they usually consist of "verb" or "verb noun", though some can be more complex than that. Let us try something:

 >'''shake tree'''

The result of this is:

 You begin to shake a tree, and notice a coconut begin to fall from the air.
 As you try to get your hand up to block it, you feel the impact as it lands
 on your head.
 You are dead.
 You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
 $

Oops. Maybe you were surprised that the game even understands the command "shake tree", but it is easy to die in old-school text adventures. (In more modern text adventures, instant deaths are less common.) Now the game has quit, and we have returned to the Unix shell prompt (here shown as [[$]]).

Note, if you type "eat shovel" that also works!

==== Manipulating the inventory ====
The [[inventory]] in a text adventure is analogous to the inventory in ''NetHack''; you can pick up, carry, drop, and use items. Let us start the game again and interact with the shovel:

 $ '''emacs -batch -l dunnet'''

We read about the dead end and the shovel again, then we try a command:

 >'''pick up shovel'''
 I don't understand that.
 >

That did not work. (In a more modern text adventure, "pick up shovel" would almost certainly work.) Though the '''help''' command has some hints, the ''Dunnet'' help does not explain much about the inventory. However, part of playing a text adventure is guessing some commands. Also, the inventory commands in ''Dunnet'' are similar to those in other text adventures.

We try a different command:

 >'''take shovel'''
 Taken.

If we look at this dead end again:

 >'''look'''
 Dead end
 You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
 In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
 trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
 from each other.

Note that "There is a shovel here." is gone, because we took the shovel. However, if we look in the inventory:

 >'''inventory'''
 You currently have:
 A lamp
 A shovel

We have the shovel, and apparently we started the game with a lamp.

Now let us try moving around. The word "east" from the description gives a hint:

 >'''east'''
 E/W Dirt road
 You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on
 both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.
 There is a large boulder here.
 >'''east'''
 Fork
 You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the
 southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.

"The ground here seems very soft." is a hint; players often need to examine the text for these hints. In this case, maybe this would be a good spot to [[apply]] the shovel.

 >'''shovel'''
 I don't understand that.
 >'''apply shovel'''
 I don't understand that.
 >'''dig'''
 I think you found something.

The first two commands did not work, but the third seems interesting. What did we find?

 >'''look'''
 Fork
 You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the
 southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.
 There is a CPU card here.
 >'''take cpu'''
 Taken.

==== Entering the building ====
At the spot where we took the CPU card, we had the option to go northeast or southeast. We go northeast (most text adventures accept the shortcut '''ne''', equivalent to {{kbd|u}} in ''NetHack''):

 >ne
 NE/SW road
 You are on a northeast/southwest road.
 >ne
 Building front
 You are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you
 to the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.
 >ne
 You don't have a key that can open this door.

The need to find a [[key]] is a common theme in text adventure games. (Contrast ''NetHack'', where you can just [[kick]] most of the doors down, but then the locked doors are only random.)

Maybe the key is on the other path?

 >'''sw'''
 NE/SW road
 >'''sw'''
 Fork
 >'''se'''
 SE/NW road
 You are on a southeast/northwest road.
 There is some food here.
 >'''take food'''
 Taken.
 >'''se'''
 Bear hangout
 You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the
 northwest.
 There is a ferocious bear here!
 >'''fight bear'''
 I don't understand that.
 >'''attack bear'''
 I don't understand that.

Luckily the game does not seem to understand our combat commands. This might have saved us, because fighting strong [[monster]]s is often an easy way to [[die]].

 >'''feed bear'''
 Done.
 The bear takes the food and runs away with it. He left something behind.

We had to use the food for something. This game does not seem so hard...

 >'''look'''
 Bear hangout
 You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the
 northwest.
 There is a shiny brass key here.

Yes, that is exactly what we need! (Unless, of course, it is the wrong key for our door...)

 >'''take key'''
 Taken.
 >'''nw'''
 SE/NW road
 >'''nw'''
 Fork
 >'''ne'''
 NE/SW road
 >'''ne'''
 Building front
 >'''look'''
 Building front
 You are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you
 to the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.

Let us check if this key works...

 >'''ne'''
 Old Building hallway
 You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
 and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.

==== Enabling the computer ====
We are now in a building with rooms to the east and west. Let us try one of them:

 >'''west'''
 Computer room
 You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
 been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
 one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
 says: This VAX is named 'pokey'.  To type on the console, use the
 'type' command.  The exit is to the east.
 The panel lights are steady and motionless.
 >'''type'''
 You type on the keyboard, but your characters do not even echo.

Wait, our inventory contains a CPU card:

 >'''inventory'''
 You currently have:
 A lamp
 A shovel
 A computer board
 A brass key

Maybe we need to use this board in this computer?

 >'''read board'''
 The CPU board has a VAX chip on it.  It seems to have
 2 Megabytes of RAM onboard.

Yes, the computer is a VAX, and this board is for a VAX, so maybe they match.

 >'''install board'''
 I don't understand that.
 >'''put board in vax'''
 As you put the CPU board in the computer, it immediately springs to life.
 The lights start flashing, and the fans seem to startup.

The command "put ''X'' in ''Y''" is common in text adventures, and seemed to work here.

 >'''type'''
  
 
 UNIX System V, Release 2.2 (pokey)
 
 login:

We have the computer working, but we are not sure yet how to login. Computer use is peculiar to ''Dunnet'' and less common in other text adventures. (Back when ''Dunnet'' appeared, most Emacs users had significant [[Unix]] knowledge.) The results of using this computer might be surprising, and the game becomes more difficult after that...

 ''(after some failed logins)''
 login incorrect
 >'''shake tree'''
 I don't see that here.
 >'''quit'''
 
 You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.

And we have not yet scored any points! Hopefully, though, this demonstration gave you some of idea of what a text adventure is like.

In ''[[Nethack]]'', the dollar sign, '''$''', refers to [[gold]] (or zorkmids) and also serves various purposes:

* In the dungeon, {{yellow|$}} represents a pile of gold pieces.
* Press {{kbd|$}} to count the gold in your [[purse]]; doing so in a [[shop]] additionally displays the debt or credit you have with its [[shopkeeper]], and all relevant values are displayed instantaneously. In any case, the count for your purse is always the same as the one on the [[status line]], and does not include any money which you hid in containers such as a [[bag]]. Checking your gold is a free action and will not increment the turn counter. 
** You can also press {{kbd|$}} to select [[gold]] while in your inventory for certain menus. [[Menu controls]] supported by [[tty]] and [[curses interface]]s allow you to press certain keys and toggle selection for all items in that particular item group - in practice, only gold ever uses the {{white|$}} item group.

}}

A '''tinning kit''' is a non-magical [[tool]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]'', and can be used to [[tin]] the [[corpse]] of a dead [[monster]]. It is made of iron.

==Generation==
The starting equipment of the [[Archaeologist]] includes an uncursed tinning kit.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|36|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

All tinning kits are generated uncursed with containing 30 to 99 charges, with the exception of [[bones]] levels and the potentially cursed items generated on some early [[trap]]s.

==Effects==
[[Apply]]ing a tinning kit to an intact corpse in your inventory or on your square will create a "tin of <monster> meat" in your inventory; this uses up a charge and removes the corpse. If you are [[fumbling]] or there is no space in the inventory, the tin will appear on the floor. You can only tin a corpse that is on the floor while [[riding]] if you have advanced to at least Basic skill.

The corpse must give at least one point of nutrition to be tinnable (i.e. [[wraith]]s cannot be tinned), and partially eaten corpses cannot be tinned. Trying to tin a [[cockatrice]] or chickatrice without gloves will instantly [[stoning|turn you to stone]], and any attempt to tin the [[Riders]] ([[Death]], [[Famine]] or [[Pestilence]]) will cause them to immediately revive. Tinning any corpse owned by a [[shopkeeper]] will incur a charge for it.

==Strategy==
{{main|Tin#Eating}}
Corpses rot away quickly and may be unsafe or too large for one person to eat; tinning circumvents these problems by preserving the meat for later consumption. It is not uncommon for players to tin named monsters and keep them as trophies - a tin of Medusa or Wizard of Yendor meat is a fun item to potentially ascend with.

Tins of corpses will provide the same [[intrinsic]] as the corpse itself, but with a set amount of nutrition as opposed to what the corpse would have provided. Tinning can therefore be a vital method to avoid becoming [[satiated]] too quickly when chewing through a pile of large desirable corpses, such as those of [[dragon]]s or [[giant (monster)|giants]]. Tinning kits are also a common form of "backup" for intrinsics that you may want later - see the [[#Tinning for emergencies|"Tinning for emergencies" section]] below.

Many unsafe corpses also do not cause their usual damage as tins. Zombies and mummies leave behind [[Sickness#Food poisoning|aged or tainted]] corpses, but they become edible when tinned, with the taint removed by the tinning process; [[poison]]ous corpses such as [[killer bees]] are similarly rendered safe to eat. [[Acidic]] corpses like [[acid blob]]s also do not cause damage if eaten from a tin&mdash;the reason for this is that "stomach acid" is solely handled by the <code>eatcorpse</code> function, which is not called when eating a tin.{{function|eat.c|cprefx}}{{function|eat.c|eatcorpse}}<!--Credit to Killian on the talk page.-->

However, corpses that [[stoning|turn you to stone]], [[sliming|turn you to slime]], [[stun]] you, or cause you to [[hallucinate]] will still have the same effect when tinned. The rules for [[cannibalism]] also apply to tins, as does the rule for eating domestic [[cat]] or [[dog]] meat - this has notable effects on at least a couple of strategies involving tins, [[#Tinning for emergencies|discussed further below]].

While tinning kits can be [[Charging#Tinning kit|recharged indefinitely]], charging may prove unnecessary outside of heavy use or low initial charges.

===Tin attributes===
{{main|Tin#Nutrition}}

Tins made from a tinning kit always have the same [[beatitude]] as the tinning kit{{refsrc|apply.c|1425}} - they will be either homemade or rotten, which is determined when the tin is eaten. Blessed tins are always homemade, while uncursed tins are {{frac|6|7}} homemade, with the remaining tins rotten; cursed tins are always rotten. Homemade tins of [[foo]] only have 50 nutrition, while rotten tins render you [[nauseous]], which lowers nutrition by 50 unless cured (though you can still gain intrinsics).

===Tinning for emergencies===
You may wish to stockpile a set of tins with valuable intrinsics in case you lose them to something like a [[gremlin]] attacking at night. The following specific monsters are worth tinning in or for emergencies or other later consumption:

* Eating the corpse of a [[nurse]] will restore you to full health and grant [[poison resistance]] if you still lack it at that point, making them a popular choice for tinning: a blessed tin of nurse meat will fully heal you in the two turns it takes to open and consume it. However, this constitutes cannibalism for [[Human (starting race)|humans]], which you will have to weigh against the convenience of fully restored HP; this is not a problem for [[Cavemen]]. A [[potion of full healing]] can do the same just as fast (if not sometimes faster), and can also increase your maximum HP; it is vulnerable to shattering, however.
* A blessed tin of [[acid blob]] or any [[acid]]ic monster always opens in one turn and can save you from [[stoning]]. The acid damage is removed by the tinning process, but the unstoning properties of the acid are not.
** Note that while a cursed [[lizard]] corpse or a cursed [[potion of acid]] will still work, a tin of acidic meat can take a long time to open, and even a blessed tin is not guaranteed to open in one turn due to [[interrupt]]ion.  However, a blessed [[tin opener]] can be applied to immediately open a tin.
* Tinning a [[troll]] will permanently stop it from reviving. Be sure that you prioritize and do not let yourself be surrounded by other dangerous monsters, however.
* [[Floating eye]] tins are a useful means of re-gaining telepathy later if it is lost (e.g. through an accidental [[murder]]).
* [[Dragon]] corpses are among the most reliable sources of particular intrinsics, and can be tinned both to obtain them without satiating yourself, and to replace them in case of intrinsic loss or theft.
* Tins of [[tengu]] are especially handy to eat once you have a [[ring of teleport control]] to avoid getting uncontrolled [[teleportitis]].
* [[Stalker]] tins are a common means of attaining permanent [[invisibility]], along with the [[see invisible]] intrinsic.

===Role-specific scenarios===
As an Archaeologist, extra food is sometimes scarce, and it may be worth using the starting tinning kit on small monsters - e.g., [[rat]]s, [[rock mole]]s, [[newt]]s and other early-game {{white|:}}, non-yellow [[mold]]s, [[ants]] and other [[insect]]s - to raise their nutrition yield and gain early intrinsics. This can also preserve your starting supply of permafood until more is secured, with the only risk coming from the tins producing rotten food (which can be alleviated by blessing the kit).

For non-[[Knight]] classes that can advance skills in riding, the ability to tin corpses while mounted can prove incredibly convenient, especially if the corpse is too heavy to carry and/or your steed is difficult to keep tame (e.g., a [[ki-rin]]).

[[Valkyrie]]s and Cavemen will appreciate having a tinning kit when stuffing themselves with giant meat from their respective quest branches, while Priests and Archaeologists can use them to tin and safely eat the corpses of undead giants. Barbarians can also use tinning kits during their quest to safely dispose of the many trolls they face along the way.

==History==
The tinning kit is introduced in [[NetHack 3.0.0]].

==Origin==
While tinning is naturally a real-world practice, the tinning kit does not necessarily have a direct real-world analogue, as the real-life canning of meats and other foods is a fairly laborious process. Based on [https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/usda/GUIDE05_HomeCan_rev0715.pdf canning guidelines] from the United States Department of Agriculture, one can infer that a ''NetHack'' tinning kit includes the following:

*A large number of tin cans.
*Soldering supplies.
*A knife (or knives) for preparing the meat.
*A pressure canner.
*Water.
*A good heat source, such as a propane burner, and fuel.
*Tongs, silicone gloves, or some other implements for handling the hot containers.
*It may optionally contain salt, a frying pan, and/or some other implement for pre-cooking the meat.

Assuming the above is true, tinning a corpse would require a lot of actions to be taken in the length of a single turn, which is already a fairly abstract unit (and flexible in terms of measure); attempts to work this out will yield different results based on the actions (movement, combat, etc.) used as a benchmark.

Of course, this is purely intellectual exercise, and it never hurts to remember that [[NetHack is not real life]].

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], one of the Chambers of Deception within the [[Lawful Quest]], the Chamber of Dragon Meat, contains a cursed tinning kit with no charges. A means of [[charging]] and [[curse removal]], or else your own tinning kit, is likely necessary to get the most out of the various dragon corpses lying around the chamber.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], the [[Undertaker]] role starts with a tinning kit, and player [[Vampire (starting race in SLASH'EM)|vampires]], [[Ghoul (starting race)|ghouls]] and [[incantifier]]s can use tinning kits to produce [[potion of blood|potions of blood]]. SlashTHEM also retains the layout of the Lawful Quest (and thus the cursed tinning kit found within).

===dNetHack===
In [[dNetHack]], all players are capable of making potions of blood via tinning kits, provided the corpse in question is from a monster that has blood. Player [[Vampire (starting race in dNetHack)|vampires]] and [[Incantifier (dNetHack starting race)|incantifiers]] in particular get the most out of generating potions of blood this way - incantifiers in particular are only capable of eating meat from [[newt]]s and [[aoa]], and vampires can drink acidic blood in lieu of eating lizard corpses to cure stoning; both races can also gain intrinsics from monster blood. Other races can simply dilute the potions for water.

[[Anachrononaut]]s can only eat prepared food, making tinning kits absolutely necessary for the consumption of corpses and blood - vampiric and [[Elf (starting race)|elven]] Anachrononauts start the game with one, and the [[Anachrononaut quest]] has a tinning kit in each of the non-filler levels.

===EvilHack===
In [[EvilHack]], all player [[Hobbit (starting race)|hobbits]] start with an identified tinning kit, unless they are Archeologists (who start with one regardless) or [[Convict]]s. Tinned corpses also give the same amount of partial intrinsic resistance as the raw corpse.

&&%s&& %s Vault {144857 2022-03-08T07:05:21Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{otheruses|gold-containing vaults|the UnNetHack feature|Random vault (UnNetHack)}}.

'''Vaults''' are 2-by-2 sealed rooms that appear in ''[[NetHack]]'', and are randomly generated in the [[Dungeons of Doom]]. The vaults are owned by [[Croesus]], and his [[guard]]s patrol them regularly.

One true [[rumor]] and one of the [[Oracle]]'s major consultations refers to them as '''Magic Memory Vaults'''.

==Generation==
A vault has a {{frac|2}} chance of being generated on any level that has at least 6 rooms, with the exception of the [[Rogue level]]. The level must also have room for the 4x4 space that the vault occupies, making the number even lower in practice. There is a {{frac|2|3}} chance that a level with a vault contains a [[closet]] with a one-use [[teleportation trap]] keyed to the vault's location, marked by the [[engraving]] "ad aerarium"<ref name="Latin">"ad aerarium" is a Latin phrase meaning ''"to the vault"'', but can also mean ''"to the sky"'' - this pun is the basis for the marked closets with level teleporters.</ref> in the dust in front of it. On deeper levels, you may also encounter closets with the same engravings that house a [[level teleporter]] instead - these appear independently of actual vault teleporters, and both may be found on the same level.<ref name="Latin"/>

On each square of a vault is 50+d(100*''level'') [[gold]] pieces, where ''level'' is the dungeon level.{{refsrc|src/sp_lev.c|2447|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Between level 11 and [[Medusa's Island]], each vault that appears also has a {{frac|3}} chance of containing a magic [[portal]] that takes you to [[Fort Ludios]] if it has not yet been generated, with the exception of the level containing the [[Quest]] portal. As such, it may not be accessible in a given game.

On levels that contain a vault, [[#Messages|messages]] indicating their presence will be printed occasionally.

==Guards==
{{main|Guard}}
If you linger within a vault for 30 turns, one of the guards will enter and ask for your name;{{refsrc|include/hack.h|35|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} blowing a [[cursed]] [[tin whistle]] while inside a vault will immediately summon a guard.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|469|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} Replying to their query with Croesus (or Kroisos/Creosote) will cause them to leave - any other name will have them ask you to drop all your gold (including gold within containers in your inventory) and follow them out. Complying will have them lead you out of the vault, and the guard will create a temporary path if there is none present - refusing to drop your gold, leaving with it via teleportation or else trying to retrieve it while the guard is present will anger them.

This can be a nuisance, especially if something else interferes with you looting the vault and leaving promptly - however, guards can also be useful if you end up trapped in one without a means of escape, which usually occurs early in the game. You can also safely double back to retrieve the gold after the guard is gone. Note that once the guard disappears, the temporary path will usually disappear soon after, which can potentially trap you if you are still inside; [[pet]]s caught in the reforming rock will be teleported elsewhere on the level and have their tameness reduced. See the linked article above for more details on interactions with guards.

==Finding vaults==
Vaults can be discovered or located through various means:

* [[Read]]ing a noncursed [[scroll of magic mapping]] or casting the {{spell of|magic mapping}} spell will detail the entire level and reveal the vault's location directly.
* Reading a [[scroll of gold detection]], [[quaff]]ing a [[potion of object detection]] or casting the {{spell of|detect treasure}} spell can reveal the location of the gold that a vault contains.
* [[Telepathy]] can reveal the location of monsters that may have randomly generated within a vault at some point - watch for monsters that move in a tight 2x2 square and/or appear isolated from the rest of the level.
* While unreliable, falling through a [[hole]] or [[trap door]] from a higher dungeon level may drop you in a vault on the level you land in.
* Finding the closet containing the vault teleporter and stepping on it will take you directly to the vault.

Once you locate a vault or its teleporter, you can enter the vault using one of the following methods:

* Warp in using the vault's teleporter - if you possess [[magic resistance]], you can press {{kbd|Ctrl|T}} while standing on the tile.
* [[Dig]] into the vault using a [[pick-axe]] or [[wand of digging]]. Once done, you can exit using the same path.
* If you have [[teleport control]] and know the vault's location, you can use a [[wand of teleportation|wand]] or [[scroll of teleportation]] to warp directly in, then dig or teleport out once you are done.

===Monsters and vaults===
[[Tunneling monster]]s such as [[dwarves]] may dig their way to the vault, leaving a path; digging monsters such as [[rock mole]]s or [[umber hulk]]s may also open a path to vaults. If there is a dwarf wandering around on a vault level, they may find the vault and take the gold while tunneling; in the case of hostile dwarves, they may then unwittingly bring the gold to you while seeking out a fight.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and earlier versions, along with most variants based on them, it is possible to steal from a still-closed vault using a [[pet]]. First, you must have both the pet and yourself in the vault. This can be done by blocking the pet in the doorway to the vault teleporter closet - as it cannot leave the doorway diagonally, the pet will eventually take the teleporter even if it is aware of the trap. This will not use up the trap, allowing you to follow it in.

Once you are in the vault with your pet, pick up all the money and then drop it and your gold in a single stack. Once the guard appears and you respond with your real name (or any other name if you are named Croesus or one of its equivalents), follow them out as slowly as possible, making sure your pet follows and brings the money with it. Be caureful not to exit the guard's path while the pet is still inside!

Starting in [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the standard domestic pets - [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and [[horse]]s - will only pick up a single gold piece at a time, making this strategy much less useful early on. 3.6.0 also introduces the ability to summon a guard via cursed tin whistle.

==Messages==
{{message|You hear the footsteps of a guard on patrol.|There is a vault on the level.}}
{{message|You hear Ebenezer Scrooge!|As above, while you are [[hallucinating]].}}
{{message|You hear someone counting money.|The level's vault has not been looted.}}
{{message|You hear Ebenezer Scrooge!|As above, while [[hallucinating]].}}
{{message|You hear someone searching|The vault has been looted.}}

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], Fort Ludios is more likely to be accessible - the portal is always in the first vault below level 10 on a floor that does not contain the Quest portal. While it is still possible for there to be no entrance to Ludios, this requires the complete absence of vaults below level 10.

UnNetHack also has a level generation feature called [[Random vault (UnNetHack)|"random vaults"]], which have no relation to the standard gold vaults.

===dNetHack===
In addition to normal gold vaults, [[dNetHack]] also has [[hell vault]]s with much more valuable treasures, but far more dangerous monsters guarding them. dNetHack will also generate the portal to Fort Ludios on the earliest eligible floor when possible.

===xNetHack===
[[xNetHack]] will also generate the portal to Fort Ludios in the first eligible vault.

&&%s&& %s Digging {149093 2022-11-26T23:46:59Z {443 Kahran042} /* Full explanation and calculations */ - Better choice of words, IMHO '''Digging''' is usually done with a [[pick-axe]], a [[dwarvish mattock]], a [[wand of digging]], or the [[spellbook of dig|spell]]. You can also dig if you polymorph into a creature that does not need a pick to use the ''[[tunnel]]'' [[monster attribute|attribute]] ({{monsymlink|rock mole}}, {{monsymlink|woodchuck}} or {{monsymlink|umber hulk}}). Casting the [[Spellbook of dig|spell of dig]] has the same effect as zapping a wand of digging.

Digging using a pick-axe or mattock is slow, and takes several [[turn]]s. Other methods use a single action.

You can dig in any horizontal direction. You can also attempt to dig upwards and downwards if you use a tool, wand or spell. If you dig upwards, you will be unable to reach the ceiling with a tool, or just loosen a [[rock]] from the ceiling and have it fall on your head with a spell or wand.

If you dig downwards with a pick-axe or mattock, you will usually create a [[pit]]. To create a pit, you need to apply the tool once. ("You start digging downward. You dig a pit in the floor"). If you dig downwards in a pit, you will create a [[hole]] and fall through. Zapping a wand of digging downwards instantly creates a hole under normal circumstances. Digging downward when standing on a [[sink]] will turn it into a (non-magical) [[fountain]], and when standing on a fountain will most likely create several [[pool]]s of water.

The ground or the walls in some levels are '''undiggable'''. These include the walls of [[Sokoban]], the ground at the bottom of several [[dungeon branch]]es, walls of the [[Castle]] and the [[Wizard's Tower]], and the like. If the floor is undiggable, digging downwards can create a pit but not a hole. The walls of [[Gehennom]] are diggable, but the wand and the spell only dig one wall per casting. (The game internally refers to walls that can't be dug as "non-diggable", not "undiggable".) [[Iron bar]]s can also be undiggable, preventing them from being dissolved by various acidic means.

==Digging speed==
Digging with a [[wand of digging]] or the [[Spellbook of dig|dig]] spell always takes exactly one action. The following discussion only applies to digging with [[pick-axe]]s and [[dwarvish mattock]]s.

=== Summary of factors ===
Generally a pick-axe or mattock takes roughly 5 turns to dig horizontally and 20 turns to dig through the floor. However, the actual time varies depending on a number of factors.

The following things speed up digging:
* having high dexterity and strength
* being a [[dwarf]]
* enchanting the pick-axe or wearing a [[ring of increase damage]] with positive enchantment (conversely, a negative damage bonus or an eroded pick-axe will slow digging)
* having intrinsic or extrinsic [[speed]] (this does not reduce the number of ''actions'', but because the player gets more actions per turn, the digging will complete in fewer ''turns'')

The following things have no impact on digging speed, although they might be expected to:
* having higher pick-axe [[skill]]
* using a [[dwarvish mattock]] rather than a pick-axe
* having higher [[Luck]]

=== Full explanation and calculations ===
You can dig up rocks, boulders, and statues with a [[pick-axe]] or a [[dwarvish mattock]], and chop down non-petrified trees with an [[axe]].

Each move you spend digging, you generate
 9 + d5 + strength & dexterity bonuses + enchantment - erosion  + [[increase damage]] bonus
points of digging effort. This is doubled if you are a starting race dwarf.{{refsrc|src/dig.c|300|nethack=3.6.6|comment=note that <code>10 + [[rn2]](5)</code> is 9 + d5}} The [[To-hit#Bonus_tables|strength & dexterity bonuses]] are the same as those used in attacks.{{refsrc|src/weapon.c|885|nethack=3.6.6}} The pick-axe skill does not play a role. Player [[speed]] proportionally speeds up digging, since you get more actions per turn.

{| class="wikitable"
!Terrain type!!Digging effort needed!! colspan="4" | Examples: expected turns
|-
| || || STR=11, DEX=11 || and thoroughly rusty || STR=18, DEX=18 || and +3 mattock 
|-
|through an existing pit||251||21.4||28.3||15.2||13.0
|-
|other floor, fountain, sink, any non-pit trap||51||4.8||6.1||3.4||3.0
|-
|statue, boulder, wall, solid rock, (secret) door; chop down tree||101||8.9||11.7||6.3||5.6
|}

There is no speed difference between a pick-axe and a mattock; however, mattocks are heavier, two-handed, and can be generated enchanted.

Wielding a digging tool by [[apply]]ing it does not take time only if you consent to actually dig at the confirmation prompt.{{refsrc|src/dig.c|972|nethack=3.6.6|comment=<code>res</code> is set to 1 if you wielded the pick.}}{{refsrc|src/dig.c|1016|nethack=3.6.6|comment=<code>res</code> is returned if you declined to specify a direction.}}{{refsrc|src/dig.c|1018|nethack=3.6.6|comment=The value of <code>res</code> is discarded, and thus the rest of the code doesn't know whether you wielded the pick at that point, and that's before it does any timing calculations.}}

Shop doors and walls will cause the warning message "This door/wall seems too hard to dig." to interrupt you, but will not take any longer to destroy if you persist. Digging through the walls or door is costly, but the floor is free. Shopkeepers have a rough idea how long this takes and will move to prevent theft. 

Special cases: Fumbling causes bad effects instead (33% chance). Digging down on an altar is impossible, but would incur the god's wrath and anger any attending priest. On the Plane of Earth, earth elementals can form, and your passage may collapse.

Digging monsters are not covered in this discussion.

==Strategy==

You can [[escape item|escape]] by digging downwards and making a hole. You will generally need a one-action method to dig, such as a wand or spell. Remember that this will deepen your dungeon level, and you might find yourself in a worse position. Monsters which [[Stairs#Monsters following|follow you on stairs]] will also follow you when you do this. [[Monster]]s will also use this escape technique when they possess a wand of digging, which can be aggravating.

If you do not have a way to cross water, you can access [[Medusa]]'s island by digging down then taking the upstair from the level below. You should be prepared to kill Medusa. Also, make sure you're not standing next to water, since your hole will fill with water, and you may drown.

You must cross [[solid rock]] to access the portal on the [[Plane of Earth]]. Digging is usually the most convenient method. Fortunately, several digging methods are provided for you on the plane itself, although it pays to go prepared.
