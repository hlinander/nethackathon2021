'''Berserk''' is a [[SLASH'EM]] [[technique]]. Immediately after using it the character gains a +2 bonus to hit, a +4 bonus to damage and is made [[fast]] for ''d(2,8)+TECHLEVEL/5+2'' turns.

&&%s&& %s Rage eruption {146996 2022-07-24T21:31:42Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''Rage eruption''' is a [[technique]] exclusive to [[dwarf|dwarves]] in [[SLASH'EM]] and [[SlashTHEM]]. It is similar to the MP-increasing [[power surge]] technique.

It increases your current and max [[HP]] by ''50 + (4 * TECHLEVEL)'', then decreases them by one every turn; you cannot go below 1 HP from any health lost this way. The technique lasts for ''50 + (4 * TECHLEVEL)'' turns - once it ends, your max HP is set to its previous value.

This technique is unavailable while you are [[polymorph]]ed.

==Strategy==
Although rage eruption is a very powerful technique that can save the lives of many dwarvish players, it has to be used with care - you will end up at 1 max HP, rendering healing impossible until the technique ends. After disposing of the monster(s) that prompted the use of a rage eruption, it is wise to run upstairs and/or engrave [[Elbereth]] to avoid being killed while at low HP.

Also, beware of [[koala]]s when using rage eruption - their otherwise harmless touch will abort the technique instantly, robbing you of all your extra HP in the middle of battle.

Rage eruption is also useful for reliably activating the limit mode on other techniques at 1 HP.

}}

'''The Hand of Vecna'''  is one of the most powerful [[artifact]]s in [[SLASH'EM]]. It can be obtained by killing [[Vecna]] in the [[Chaotic Quest]], provided you don't [[digest]] or [[disintegrate]] him. Although it is guarded by an army of [[Lich|{{white|L}}]], [[zombie|{{white|Z}}]], [[vampire|{{white|V}}]] and [[Vecna]] himself, most players go through the trouble of killing them to acquire it. Like the other two [[alignment quest]] artifacts, you can't [[wish]] for it ("For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!"), and in a bones file, it will revert to a [[severed hand]].

If you [[eat]] the hand, you will take 150&ndash;199 damage, so this is a [[Bad Idea]]. The game will have the courtesy to ask if you're sure you want to eat a severed hand, though ("Are you sure you want to eat that? [ynq] (n)"). If you survive the Hand scrabbling around inside you, you gain all of 40 nutrition points ("This Hand of Vecna is delicious!  You feel the hand scrabbling around inside of you!") You can [[sacrifice]] the Hand ("You offer this evil thing to <your god>..."); this gets rid of it permanently, and thus is also a (somewhat less, admittedly) [[Bad Idea]].

==Carrying==
When carried, the Hand provides [[cold resistance]], [[half physical damage]], and hungerless [[regeneration]]. Given that for many characters it will be the only possible source of the latter two properties, it is extremely desirable simply to have in one's inventory. Be sure not to eat or sacrifice it&mdash;a good idea is to set it to an inventory letter you are unlikely to accidentally press.

==Wielding==
While the Hand is certainly no weapon, for those who lack a source of [[drain resistance]], it provides a handy way to gain it at the snap of a finger. It is quicker, in fact, than carrying an [[amulet of drain resistance]], since you don't lose a turn (and thus possibly a level) taking anything off. While wielding it, you can then select an appropriate wand or other means to dispatch whatever monster is zapping a [[wand of draining]] at you.

==Invoking==
If your [[Luck]] is lower than &minus;9, you get the following message:
; "The Hand claws you with its icy nails!"
and receive 5&ndash;24 damage.

Otherwise, 
; "Creatures from the grave surround you!"
and you summon 4&ndash;7 tame [[graveyard]] creatures. You also take a &minus;3 penalty to both [[Luck]] and [[alignment record]].

==Origin==
The hand is an important artifact from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. There too, is the severed hand of defeated [[Vecna]]. It's an original creation of ''D&D''.

==History==
In [[SLASH 6]], a precursor to SLASH'EM, killing Vecna could produce either the Hand of Vecna or the Eye of Vecna, with an equal chance of each.  As in SLASH'EM, the Hand conferred regeneration, cold resistance, and half physical damage, and could summon the undead when invoked.  

The Eye of Vecna was an artifact [[eyeball]] that conferred [[ESP]], cold resistance, and [[half spell damage]] when carried.  Invoking it would turn its [[The Eye of the Beholder#Invoke|icy gaze]] on all monsters within the player's line of sight, reducing their health to a fraction of its current amount.  Just like the Hand, the Eye's invocation effect came with a &minus;3 penalty to both Luck and alignment record.  Attempting to invoke it with a Luck of &minus;9 or less would kill the player instantly.

The Eye of Vecna was not carried over into SLASH'EM; however, its icy gaze was retained as the invocation effect of [[the Eye of the Beholder]], the prize for completing the [[Neutral Quest]].

&&%s&& %s Sessile {81346 2012-11-02T09:45:33Z {4000318 Godska} This doesn't seem stubby to me {{wikipedia}}{{wikipedia|Motile}}
In [[wikipedia:zoology|zoology]], a '''sessile''' animal is one that cannot move from one place to another; those that can are referred to as '''motile'''.

In [[NetHack]], sessile [[monster]]s have a [[speed]] of zero, and never move of their own volition, possessing only [[passive attack]]s.

Only seven monsters are truly sessile in NetHack, although there are a larger number with [[Monsters (by speed)|relatively slow speeds]]. The sessile monsters are:

*{{monsymlink|Oracle}}
*{{monsymlink|spotted jelly}}
*{{monsymlink|blue jelly}}
*{{monsymlink|red mold}}
*{{monsymlink|green mold}}
*{{monsymlink|brown mold}}
*{{monsymlink|yellow mold}}

[[Tame]] sessile monsters may be [[Pet|displaced]] (1/7 chance).

==Strategy==

Truly sessile monsters can normally be left alone; even if they block a corridor, the [[player]] can usually [[dig]] around them or [[teleport]] them away safely. This contrasts with slower-moving monsters, such as [[floating eye]]s, which can move and block players if left unmolested.

Killing high-level sessile monsters while avoiding their passive attack can be frustrating; there is no way to retrieve any [[missile]]s thrown at them until they are killed, short of teleportation or taming; slow-moving monsters move eventually, allowing missiles to be retrieved. Players should therefore use [[rock]]s and other [[junk]] to kill such monsters.

Sessile monsters can be used by players to block all monster access to certain squares, to cover a [[stash]] or to protect a [[boulder fort]] from [[giant]]s, for example. Typically these will be generated by [[reverse genocide]]. The player may wish to tame the sessile monsters to be able to move them around, although this means that [[magic whistle]]s should not be used on that level. Many spoilers propose blue jellies for this function: unlike the molds, they are unlikely to be killed in a single blow by a careless player, and unlike spotted jellies, their passive attack is easy to gain resistance to.  For a careful player, however, any sessile monster will do.

When [[polymorph]]ing pets using a [[polymorph trap]], producing a sessile monster spells the end of the activity, unless the hero has [[magic resistance]] (to safely displace the pet) or a magic whistle.

Polymorphing oneself into a sessile monster normally leads to one of two outcomes very quickly, from the player's perspective -- either the time on the polymorph expires, returning the player to his or her previous form, or a hostile monster attacks and kills the player, returning him or her to the previous form.  The player will not get an opportunity to move while sessile. However, a source of [[speed]] will allow the player to take the occasional turn (although still not to move).

Drain life is represented by the macro '''AD_DRLI'''.{{refsrc|monattk.h|52|comment=AD_DRLI macro}}

==Strategy==

With [[magic cancellation]] changes in [[3.6.0]], drain life attacks have become a little less preventable.  Thankfully, most of the time you don't need to worry about it, since the first lost level is immediately regained due to the experience gained when the attacker is killed.  If you expect to get hit many times, you can temporarily equip MC3 items or wield one of the [[drain resistance]] artifacts; MC3 will reduce the level drain chance to 1 in 30, which is good enough for most purposes.  If you do somehow lose two levels at once, you can regain the second one by drinking a blessed [[potion of full healing]] (which will also have its usual effect).

You can '''pick up''' items from the dungeon floor using the {{kbd|,}} key. If there is only one item or stack in your square, you will usually pick it up without further prompting; otherwise you will be asked which items you want to pick up, where you can use [[menu controls]] to refine your selection. You can press {{kbd|m}}{{kbd|,}} to pick up items off the floor using a menu, even if you're using [[option#menustyle|menustyle:traditional]].

The [[options#pickup_burden|pickup burden]] option sets an [[encumbrance]] limit. If an item you attempt to pick up would take you past that limit, you will be prompted to confirm, unless the item is a [[loadstone]].

Picking items up normally uses an action. You can also configure [[autopickup]], which will allow you automatically to pick up items on the square you move onto; autopickup does not take any time.

==Exceptions==
If the item would take you past your maximum [[Encumbrance|carrying capacity]], you can't pick it up, unless the item is a loadstone.

If you have already filled all of your 52 knapsack slots (<tt>a-zA-Z</tt>), you can't pick up any further items unless they stack with your current inventory, or the item is [[gold]] (which gets the letter <tt>$</tt>) or a loadstone (which gets <tt>#</tt>).

If you are [[polymorph]]ed into a creature without hands, you can't pick anything up unless your form has another means of doing so (e.g. [[canine]]s and their mouths, or [[whirly]] monsters).

[[Levitating]] prevents you picking up items off the ground unless you have a [[bullwhip]] on hand.

A cross-aligned [[quest artifact]] is likely to evade your grasp and prevent you picking it up.

== Monsters==
[[Monsters]] can pick up items from the floor as well. Whether a monster is willing to pick up a specific class of item is defined by the monster's [[Monster attribute|attributes]]:{{refsrc|src/monmove.c|1020|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

{|class="wikitable"
! Item class !! Monster attribute required to pick up
|-
| [[Zorkmid|Gold]] || monsters which like gold
|-
| [[Weapon]]s, [[armor]], [[gem]]s, [[food]] (except [[corpse]]s) || monsters which can pick up weapons and food
|-
| [[Amulet]]s, [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s, [[wand]]s, [[ring]]s, [[spellbook]]s || monsters which can pick up magical items
|-
| [[Boulder]]s (when not in [[Sokoban]]) || monsters which can throw boulders
|-
| [[Gem]]s (excluding [[rock]]s and [[gray stone]]s) || monsters which like gems
|-
| [[Pick-axe]]s || monsters which need a pick-axe to tunnel through walls
|}

In addition to the above, [[intelligent monster]]s will pick up items that are useful to their specific situation:{{refsrc|src/muse.c|2047|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

* if the monster is not already [[invisible]], and the monster has no [[gaze attack]], they will pick up charged [[Wand of make invisible|wands of make invisible]] and [[Potion of invisibility|potions of invisibility]];
* if the monster is not already [[Speed#Monsters|fast]], they will pick up charged [[Wand of speed monster|wands of speed monster]] and [[Potion of speed|potions of speed]];
* if the monster is not [[floating]], they will pick up charged [[Wand of digging|wands of digging]];
* if the monster has difficulty less than 6, they will pick up charged [[Wand of polymorph|wands of polymorph]];
* they will always pick up charged [[Wand of striking|wands of striking]], [[Wand of teleportation|teleportation]], and [[Wand of create monster|create monster]];
* they will always pick up charged [[ray]] wands (e.g. [[Wand of death|wands of death]]);
* they will always pick up the following potions:
** [[Potion of healing|potions of healing]], [[Potion of extra healing|extra healing]], and [[Potion of full healing|full healing]];
** [[Potion of polymorph|potions of polymorph]];
** [[Potion of gain level|potions of gain level]];
** [[Potion of paralysis|potions of paralysis]];
** [[Potion of sleeping|potions of sleeping]];
** [[Potion of acid|potions of acid]];
** [[Potion of confusion|potions of confusion]];
** [[Potion of blindness|potions of blindness]] (if the monster has no [[gaze attack]]);
* they will always pick up the following scrolls:
** [[Scroll of teleportation|scroll of teleportation]];
** [[Scroll of create monster|scroll of create monster]];
** [[Scroll of earth|scroll of earth]];
** [[Scroll of fire|scroll of fire]];
* if the monster is not [[nonliving]], they will pick up [[Amulet of life saving|amulets of life saving]];
* they will always pick up [[Amulet of reflection|amulets of reflection]];
* non-[[unicorn]]s will pick up non-cursed [[unicorn horn]]s;
* if the monster can blow (roughly, has a head and breathes), they will pick up charged [[Frost horn|frost]] and [[fire horn]]s;
* if the monster is wearing [[gloves]], they will pick up [[chickatrice]] and [[cockatrice]] corpses;
* they will always pick up [[chickatrice]] and [[cockatrice]] eggs;
* if the monster is not themselves [[Stoning resistance|resistant to stoning]], they will pick up corpses that cure stoning (e.g. [[lizard]]s), as well as [[tin]]s of the same (if they can eat tins).

A different set of rules govern if/when monsters will use the items they pick up, depending on whether it's considered a [[defensive item]], [[offensive item]] or [[miscellaneous item]].

&&%s&& %s Numeric prefix {104941 2017-02-02T10:11:48Z {4000873 CharlieBr0wn} Review for 3.6.0m nothing to change. Many commands in NetHack can be preceded by a '''numeric prefix''', which modifies the action taken. This usually involves repeating the command several times, or interacting with a specified number of items.

If you are playing with ''vi keys'' (i.e. with ''[[number_pad]]'' off), you can enter numeric prefixes directly before the command, e.g. {{kbd|10|link=0}}{{kbd|s}} to [[search]] for 10 moves.

If you are playing with ''number_pad'' on, you will need to use {{kbd|n}} to begin a numeric prefix, e.g. {{kbd|n}}{{kbd|100|link=0}}{{kbd|t}}{{kbd|$}} to throw 100 [[zorkmid]]s.

When firing a [[missile]], the numeric prefix caps the number of missiles fired in a single move (see [[multishot]]).  It can only decrease, not increase, the number of missiles fired.

You can also use numbers to specify a certain number of items in some menus, such as when using the extended [[drop]] command or when [[apply]]ing a [[container]]. When the menu is visible, you can type a number followed by the menu letter (e.g. {{kbd|20|link=0}}{{kbd|a}}) to manipulate only some of the items in the stack. You do not need to use ''n'', even when ''number_pad'' is enabled.

* {{monsymlink|freezing sphere}}
* {{monsymlink|flaming sphere}}
* {{monsymlink|shocking sphere}}
* {{monsymlink|yellow light}}

Note that [[gas spore]]s are not considered to have an explosion attack, since their explosion is instead triggered by death from HP loss.

Explosion attacks are represented by the macro '''AT_EXPL'''.

&&%s&& %s Miscellaneous item {148206 2022-09-21T14:50:44Z {187 Darth l33t} standardize Kops name In ''[[NetHack]]'', a '''miscellaneous item''' may be created as part of a [[monster starting inventory|monster's inventory]] when the monster is generated. 

==Description==
Monsters may be generated with a miscellaneous item if that monster's level equals or exceeds the roll of a d100.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|796|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

The following monster types are ineligible for miscellaneous items:

* [[Animal]]s
* Monsters with [[explosion attack]]s
* [[Mindless]] monsters
* [[Ghost]]s and [[shade]]s
* [[Keystone Kop]]s of any rank

In addition, regular [[soldier]]s have a 12/13 chance of missing out on the miscellaneous item roll.{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|791|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

If the monster's [[difficulty]] is 5 or less, it has a {{frac|30}} chance to receive a polymorph item, which will be a [[wand of polymorph]] {{frac|6}}th of the time, or else a [[potion of polymorph]]. Otherwise, if the monster is living (e.g excluding [[undead]], [[golem]]s, and [[vortices]] among others), it has a {{frac|40}} chance to receive an [[amulet of life saving]].

Otherwise, the monster gets an item from one of these sets, with each set equally likely:
* a [[wand of speed monster]] ({{frac|6}}th of the time) or a [[potion of speed]]
* a [[wand of make invisible]] ({{frac|6}}th of the time) or a [[potion of invisibility]] - or neither if the monster is [[peaceful]] and the player cannot currently [[see invisible]]
* a [[potion of gain level]]

[[Guard]]s will not use [[speed]]-boosting items, and according to the code are not meant to receive them - however, <code>mtmp->isgd</code> is only set after <code>makemon()</code> is called, thus making it possible for them to generate with one. In practice, this only means that you will occasionally find a potion of speed or wand of speed monster in a deceased guard's inventory.{{refsrc|src/vault.c|387|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} {{refsrc|src/muse.c|1731|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Usage==
[[Intelligent monster]]s with hands will use miscellaneous items when they are within 6 tiles Euclidean distance of you, with some exceptions:{{refsrc|src/muse.c|1644|nethack=3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/muse.c|1679|nethack=3.6.6}}

* Guards, shopkeepers, and priests will not quaff a cursed potion of gain level.
* Peaceful, non-invisible monsters will not use a wand of make invisible or potion of invisibility, unless you can see invisible.
* Guards will not use a potion of speed or wand of speed monster.

&&%s&& %s Gehennom (Lethe patch) {143098 2021-10-06T07:02:59Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  The [[Lethe patch]] against vanilla ''[[NetHack]]'' and [[SLASH'EM]] features a new and retooled '''[[Gehennom]]'''. A modified version of this patch is also used in [[UnNetHack]], and some parts of it have been incorporated into the neutral quest and demon lair levels in [[dNetHack]]. As UnNetHack has almost entirely removed the hated amnesia mechanic, it does not include Lethe water in the levels inspired by this patch. 

==Asmodeus' lair==
[[Asmodeus]]' lair is located between levels 2 and 5 of Gehennom. Like all levels below Medusa's Island in the Lethe patch, it contains [[amnesia]]-inducing Lethe water in lieu of normal water. The floors are undiggable.

The level contains two [[drawbridge]]s over the river, which can be [[Drawbridge#Opening_and_Closing|opened with magical means]]. The regions marked with {{gray|,}}s are considered [[lemure pit]]s. Asmodeus is in the [[throne room]] (two squares above the throne, on the down staircase), accompanied by two [[marilith]]s, two [[succubi]], an [[incubus]] (on the [[throne]]), and two [[barbed devil]]s (guarding the door). The throne room antechamber also contains three [[squeaky board]]s and three [[fire trap]]s. There is also a fake throne room containing four random {{mcsl|&}} (each with a [[potion of invisibility]]), a [[giant mimic]] mimicing a [[stairway]] down, and four [[magic trap]]s. The other marked traps are two [[spiked pit]]s, two [[anti-magic field]]s, two [[fire trap]]s, a [[rust trap]], a [[polymorph trap]], and a [[magic trap]]. The treasure room in the lower central area contains an [[amulet of change]], a [[ring of hunger]], and three random {{mcsl|&}}. The one on the top guards 500 gold pieces and a cursed [[diamond]] named "The Tears of Koth", the one in the middle guards 500 gold pieces and a cursed [[ruby]] named "The Heart of Cassanova", and the one on the bottom carries 500 gold pieces and a cursed [[emerald]] named "The Eye of Hera". The small 1×2 room on the right side of the river has a cursed [[scroll of fire]] and a [[magic trap]] on the upper square, and a cursed [[scroll of earth]] and a [[land mine]] on the lower square. The room to the right of it contains four gold pieces, a [[potion of polymorph]], a cursed scroll of demonology, a cursed scroll of elementalism (both scrolls are on the same square), two [[fire trap]]s, and two [[magic trap]]s (one of which is under the southern gold piece), a [[spiked pit]], and an [[anti-magic trap]] (under the left gold piece. The [[fountain]] room contains four random {{mcsl|&}} and two random {{mcsl|V}}. The stair room contains an [[imp]], a cursed [[loadstone]], a cursed [[amulet of strangulation]] (on the square next to the stairs), and a cursed &minus;2 [[helm of opposite alignment]] (on the stairs themselves). The room north of the stair room contains four [[hell hound]]s. There is a small 1×1 corridor section just outside this room containing a [[scroll of teleportation]]. Finally, the room in the far northeast contains a [[blue jelly]].

==The Pleasant Valley==
The Pleasant Valley is located between levels 4 and 11 of Gehennom, and contains the entrance to Vlad's Tower. The floor is undiggable, and the Lethe River flows through the level. All random monsters on the level are {{mcsl|V}}, {{mcsl|S}}, {{mcsl|E}}, {{mcsl|H}}, {{mcsl|M}}, {{mcsl|O}}, {{mcsl|R}}, {{mcsl|T}}, {{mcsl|&}}, or {{mcsl|Z}}.

The ladder to Vlad's Tower is in the building in the southwest. Scattered throughout the level are a healer, a rogue, a barbarian, a ranger, a wizard, a samurai, a knight, a valkyrie, six sheep, three lambs, two goats, three chickens, and twelve random {{mcsl|n}}. There are eight random {{mcsl|;}} in the river. The entrance room to the tower contains three winter wolves and a werewolf, and the throne room contains 28 random monsters. There is a master lich with a scroll of demonology and a ring of free action on the throne, accompanied by two vampire lords, each with a random potion. The hallway to the ladder room is guarded by an iron golem, and there is another in the ladder room itself. There are four monkeys in the forest (one is not shown, since it's on the same space as a nymph), three of whom have musical instruments&mdash;a wooden harp; a bugle and a tooled horn; and a leather drum. Traps in the forest include a squeaky board and three pits, and the traps on the south bank of the river are three spiked pits and seven magic traps, as well as an anti-magic field just inside the tower. The level also contains a chest (marked), five random comestibles, and five other random items.

==Juiblex's swamp==
Juiblex's level is located between levels 4 and 7 of Gehennom, and is unchanged from vanilla NetHack. Indeed, the swamp is not Lethe water, as of Lethe patch 1.5, possibly due to a bug or oversight.

==Baalzebub's lair==
Baalzebub's lair is located between levels 6 and 9 of Gehennom. Teleportation is disabled on the level, the floors are undiggable, and the Lethe flows through the level.
