==Strategy==
Punishers are visible via [[telepathy]]. Because they frequently cast [[summon nasties]] while the player is near, cannot be killed with instadeath attacks, and are otherwise troublesome to kill in straight-up combat, they are best evaded. Continued levitation is also advised, in case a fire-breathing dragon or monster with a wand of fire is created, which could melt the [[ice]] under you. You can also try to dig/fire through the ice walls to create a path to avoid them.

==Encyclopedia entry==

        Former wizards of the dark pits, the Punishers are immortal

	of their duties.

The '''blue slime''' is a monster added in [[UnNetHack]] and is only generated in the [[Sheol]] branch. It boasts the unique ability to encase whatever it attacks in ice for several turns.

==Strategy==
By the time you reach Sheol, blue slimes should not be a challenge on their own. However their ability to freeze you in place can be quite harmful if a more powerful monster is near, such as a [[crystal ice golem]]. They should thus be fought alone if possible to avoid being turned into a punching bag for other monsters.

The '''chillbug''' is a monster added in [[UnNetHack]] that is normally generated only in the [[Sheol]] branch. When not currently attacking, chillbugs regenerate health very quickly. 

Chillbugs also appear in [[SlashTHEM]], where they have a single 6d5 [[cold]] bite attack and can randomly appear anywhere.

==Strategy==
Chillbugs can hit moderately hard, but by the time you reach Sheol they should be manageable. Just try not to get surrounded by the groups that they generate in.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Chillbugs are insects that are native residents of Sheol.  They are said to be composed of liquid ice.  Their ability to quickly regenerate has puzzled many humans and non-humans alike.

Sheol - The icy cold netherworld.
(c) 2012 Mikko Juola

    Sheol is a branch in Gehennom that features more danger and less
    tediousness.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    It adds:

    - Ice walls and crystal ice walls
      They act like normal walls but can be melted with a wand
      of fire. Crystal ice walls are immune to everything except
      fire and crystal picks. Ice walls can be shattered with
      a mattock or a pick-axe but wands of digging don't work
      on them.

    - Ice traps
      Like fire traps but ice you instead. Protect your potions!

    - New monsters:
      Crystal ice golem, ice golem, black angel, chillbug, Punisher,
      white naga and the Executioner. Many of these have abilities
      not seen in vanilla. Some are highly dangerous!

    - New items:
      crystal pick
      It can dig crystal ice walls and has high damage.

    - New levels:
      Sheol has a new map generator and some hand-made levels.

      Vlad has been put inside Sheol. It will be found somewhere below or at
      the middle level of Sheol.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    This branch is aimed at experienced players who think Gehennom is too
    easy or too tedious. It provides a refreshing change to all those
    mazes.

The '''crystal ice golem''' is a [[golem]] added in [[UnNetHack]]. This powerful creature is only randomly generated within the icy confines of [[Sheol]], along with the somewhat less dangerous [[ice golem]]. They can't be tamed.

The crystal ice golem shares some similarities with the [[crystal golem]] in [[SLASH'EM]], as both have powerful melee attacks combined with random breath attacks. The crystal ice golem is slightly weaker than the SLASH'EM golem, presumably because it is made of ice rather than rock crystal: its base level is slightly lower (28, compared to 32), its [[magic resistance (monster)|MR]] is half that of the crystal golem, and it lacks [[fire resistance]]. However, its attacks are more powerful and it resists [[disintegration]].

Unlike the crystal golem, the crystal ice golem does not [[death drop]] [[gems]]&mdash;or ice, for that matter.

{{todo|Some of the stats for the crystal ice and regular ice golems seem reversed; e.g. the crystal ice golem has half the MR of the regular ice golem, and a higher frequency. Is this a mistake in the source code?}}

The '''white naga''' and '''white naga hatchling''' are members of the [[naga]] monster class, added in [[UnNetHack]]. They resist [[cold]] and [[poison]] damage, and their corpses convey the same resistances. The adult form has a cold-based spit attack.

Adult white nagas may be found randomly generated only in the ice-themed [[Sheol]] branch. Hatchlings [[Monster frequency#Adjustment for aligned levels and branches|can appear on aligned levels]], as other baby monsters do, and can be hatched from eggs, however.

The '''Executioner''' is a unique [[monster]] that appears in [[UnNetHack]]. He is incredibly deadly, possessing two extremely strong weapon attacks that can each hit for a maximum of 50 base damage, and has resistances to [[cold resistance|cold]], [[fire resistance|fire]], [[poison resistance|poison]], and [[Stoning resistance|stoning]].

==Generation==
The Executioner only appears in the lowest level of [[Sheol]], and awaits the player on the throne within his dwelling, opposite of the stair case. He [[Monster starting inventory|will always be generated]] with a [[cloak of magic resistance]] and the [[artifact]] [[battle-axe]] [[Cleaver]], which is replaced with a normal battle-axe if Cleaver is already generated in that game; the battle-axe will always be [[rustproof]]ed in either case.

==Strategy==
With a base [[AC]] of -2 and 18 [[speed]], the Executioner can wipe out even ascension-ready players in a couple of turns, and is assisted by various other monsters on the same floor, particularly [[blue slime]]s that can freeze you in ice. In addition to intrinsic [[stoning]] resistance preventing the use of [[footrice]] [[corpse]]s, his starting cloak and decent [[monster magic resistance]] nullifies the [[wand of death]] and dampens or outright nullifies most spell-based approaches. Carelessly approaching him in melee without proper protection can spell instant death even if you have an [[amulet of life saving]], due to his speed and multiple attacks per turn.

However, the Executioner's threat can be greatly reduced if you can liberate his weapon from his hands, especially if it is Cleaver; without the artifact's damage bonuses, his melee attacks are somewhat more manageable, but still very dangerous. The [[half physical damage]] attribute may save your life several times over compared to an actual [[amulet of life saving]], especially if you can come into the fight unencumbered and wearing [[speed boots]]; this can give you valuable turns to retreat and/or use any means of healing you have available. You can also use a [[wand of teleportation]] against him to give you some breathing room; teleporting yourself will not work, as Sheol is a branch of [[no-teleport level]]s.

Despite resisting many ranged forms of assault, the Executioner can still be picked off at a distance due to lacking any range of hiss own; you can block his path using [[boulders]] from a [[scroll of earth]] or any traps that may appear in the room, and then unleash a storm of your best projectiles to bring him down. [[Spider web]]s and [[bear trap]]s can also temporarily pin the Executioner in place. Though he has an MR score of 50, the Executioner also has no [[sleep resistance]], and is just as vulnerable to [[paralysis]] as every other monster; if you can survive a round or two in melee and have sleep resistance and/or a [[ring of free action]], you can hit him with a [[potion of sleep]] or [[potion of paralysis|paralysis]] to immobilize him long enough for a highly-enchanted artifact weapon to kill him.

[[Polymorph]]ing into a [[black dragon]] allows you to dispatch the Executioner with ease, as he does not resist [[disintegration]], and two blasts of breath is enough to destroy his cloak and then disintegrate him; note that this will destroy his weapon as well, so do not resort to this if you wish to obtain it unless you can get it off his person beforehand.

If you only want the hoard of items he guards (including the [[crystal pick]] and [[magic marker]] that are both guaranteed), you can run past him or teleport him away to get at the chest furthest from the stairs; you can then [[level teleport]] out safely, as levelporting ignores no-teleport levels.

One player was able to successfully hit him with a [[spell of sleep]] and take him out with a well-enchanted [[Magicbane]]; this led to the suggested [[T-shirt]] message "I knocked off the Executioner and all I got was this lousy crystal pick".{{refsrc|src/read.c|60|unnethack=1986}} 

==Origin==
{{Wikipedia|Executioner}}
An executioner, also known as a hangman or headsman, is an official who executes a sentence of capital punishment on a legally condemned person, with a warrant authorizing or ordering them to execute the sentence in order to protect the executioner from murder charges. The Executioner is based in particular on the common stereotype of a hooded medieval or absolutist axe-wielding headsman; real-life executioners, whether employed in an official capacity or a symbolic capacity, were not robed in all black and only used hoods if their identity and anonymity were meant to be preserved from the public.

Many executioners were professional specialists who traveled a circuit or region performing their duty, as executions tended to be very uncommon. In Western Europe and its colonies, executioners were also often shunned by their neighbours, as reflected in fiction set within those locations (usually within the medieval eras).

==Encyclopedia entry==

Executioners like to immediately execute adventurers who get trapped in their icy lairs. Challenging them in direct hand-to-hand combat would be headlessly stupid.

'''The Ruins of Moria''' is a dungeon branch in [[UnNetHack]], modeled after the Mines of Moria from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy. It has six levels.

In contrast to the book, the player explores Moria from the bottom up, eventually reaching the West-gate of Moria (also known as [[lotr:Doors of Durin|the Doors of Durin]]). During the journey, the player will find both masses of [[Orc (monster class)|orcs]], often with enchanted gear, and vast riches.

There are six levels in the Ruins of Moria, numbered from the bottom-most one up. Minus the third, every level contains one or two [[cursed]] [[scroll of teleportation|scrolls of teleportation]] named "Word of Recall"; this is an ''[[Angband]]'' reference.

==General strategy==
Raiding Moria is quite lucrative, especially when done early, but is also dangerous for the unprepared and inexperienced. On the other hand, a Gehennom-ready post-quest character should have few problems.

This level recreates the location of the final battle from ''[[wikipedia:The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. The downstair and upstair are on the leftmost and rightmost ends of the level, respectively; between them is a narrow bridge flanked by huge lakes of lava. In the middle of the bridge is the [[corpse]] of a [[Wizard (player monster)|wizard]] along with a very burnt [[quarterstaff]] and burnt [[robe]]; there are also 2d4 [[Dwarf (monster)|dwarf corpses]] scattered around the level, as well as 2d2 cursed [[dwarvish mithril-coat|dwarvish mithril-coats]] that are buried underground, and 2d5 random objects. These corpses are intended to represent the fallen Fellowship.

At the rightmost end of the bridge is [[Durin's Bane]], a unique [[balrog]]; he is equipped with: a [[fireproof]], uncursed [[bullwhip]]; a [[wand of speed monster]]; a cursed [[potion of paralysis]]; and, 33% of the time, a [[shield of reflection]]. 60% of monsters randomly generated after level creation will be orcs, and 70% of those will be Deep orcs.

==Level 3: Moria Tribute Level==
Unlike the other levels, the third floor is more of a "filler" rooms-and-corridors level. However, it is designed to resemble an actual level from the game ''[[Moria (roguelike)|Moria]]'' (even employing a similar style of fixed layout in previous versions), and as such is not a [[persistent level]] - you will get a hint regarding this upon arriving, where you are greeted with this message:

{{message|''"The dungeon here seems less persistent."''}}

This means that the level will be re-generated every time you enter it, with any items left on the ground being permanently lost; an engraving that has chance of appearing on this level reads ''"Why, oh why didn't I leave my items in the town?"'', alluding to this. As such, the level does not contain any randomly generated items, barring those included in [[monster starting inventory|the inventory]] of randomly generated monsters. If a [[unique item]] is left on the level, however, it will not change upon leaving and re-entering, since the unique items are required to be indestructible.

While on the level, the flavor message ''"You feel the dungeon suddenly center itself around you!"'' occasionally appears - in ''Moria'', the player is always in the center of the screen, with the dungeon "scrolling" around them.

70% of all monsters generated after level creation will be orcs, and 70% of those will be Deep orcs.

==Level 4: The Halls of Moria==
The fourth level is the Halls of Moria, which has four possible fixed layouts; most of them are in the style of cavernous halls of stone pillars with randomly placed stairs.

The place is completely overrun by orcs, with 30+1d4 Deep orcs, 20+1d4 [[hill orcs]], and 10+1d4 [[orc captains]], in addition to 1d3 [[trolls]], generated in locations scattered throughout the level at its creation; these monsters will always be generated hostile. There are 2d4 blessed dwarvish mithril-coats scattered about (which have positive enchantments up to +5), along with 10+3d5 random objects; 25% of the time, a lit [[oil lamp]] will be present. 90% of monsters randomly generated after level creation will be orcs, and 70% of those will be Deep orcs.

If you don’t have [[reflection]] by the time you reach here, you should seriously consider heading back, as the orc swarm will have plenty of attack wands to use on you, with a non-negligible chance of one of them carrying a [[wand of death]].

The fifth level consists of a large, randomly-generated forest in the center, with each space having a 25% chance of containing a [[tree]]. 75% of the time, the forest will be composed of a majority regular trees; the remaining 25% of the time, the forest will be mostly full of [[dead tree]]s. There is an independent 25% chance that the forest will also be a swamp, with 20% of the empty tiles converted to [[muddy swamp]], and 1d4 [[swamp ferns]] placed throughout the level.

There will always be a peaceful [[iron golem]] that generates with an uncursed [[axe]]; it also has a 50% of generating with a [[tin opener]], a 20% chance of a [[can of grease]], and a 15% chance of a [[tinning kit]]. 2d4 [[bear trap]]s, 2d8 [[comestible]]s, and 2d6 random objects are placed throughout the forest. If the level is created at [[night]], two [[bats]] and 1d2 {{mcsl|B}} are additionally generated. 10% of monsters randomly generated after level creation orcs, and 70% of those will be Deep Orcs.

On the rightmost side of the level is the upstairs, as well as two orcish barracks behind secret doors. These barracks also have dwarf [[prisoner]]s behind iron bars.

==Level 6: Doors of Durin==
The sixth and uppermost level of Moria has two variants: an "intact" version and a "ruined" version, each with different loot. Both variants have an equal chance of appearing. When the player enters this level, they are greeted with the message:

{{message|''You hear the sound of restless waters''.}}

===Common traits===
The downstair is always in the room at the southwest corner of the map, which is connected to a small [[graveyard]]; past this graveyard is a warehouse with 5+2d4 random objects. The warehouse is connected to the main hallway, with the main gate at its rightmost end; across from the warehouse is the "Twenty-First Hall". To the right of this Hall, there is an altar room, and to its left is a treasure room; past the treasure room is "The Chamber of Mazarbul" which contains various [[chest]]s and a [[grave]] with the epitaph "Balin, Son of Fundin, Lord of Moria".

On the other side of the main gate is a [[melon]] and a engraving that can only be read at night: "Speak, friend, and enter". ("Mellon" is elvish for "friend"). The path outside leads to a lake that contains the [[Watcher in the Water]], a unique kraken-like [[sea monster]] that always carries an uncursed [[magic lamp]]).

In the intact variant of the Doors of Durin, the Twenty-First Hall has 21 rocks, a [[flint stone]], and a [[lembas wafer]]. The caches in the north and south walls of the treasure room are lined with four chests each, containing 1d3 random objects per chest. The altar room contains a cross-aligned [[altar]]; there is also an [[ice box]], two [[iron safe]]s, and three [[large boxes]], whose contents are randomly generated as normal.

The Chamber of Mazarbul contains four dwarf [[statues]] and six chests, each containing a specific type of item: [[scroll]], [[potion]], [[wand]], [[amulet]], [[ring]], or [[spellbook]].

40% of monsters randomly generated after level creation will be orcs, and 80% of these will be Deep orcs.

Once cleared out, this version serves as an excellent temporary base because it has an altar. You can easily haul loot from lower levels to b/u/c test and sort. If you successfully convert the altar and have a means of flying or water walking, the lake is safe for diluting potions once the Watcher in the Water has been killed. If you have the patience, this is also a relatively secure environment for [[polypiling]] -- the corridor outside of the altar room is exactly 8 tiles in length and has a lockable door.

The second, “ruined” version of the Doors of Durin is less bountiful than its counterpart. The Twenty-First Hall is filled with corpses instead of its normal contents, and the eight chests in the treasure room each only have a 50% chance of spawning. The altar room has a boulder place of the altar; the ice box, iron safes, and large boxes each only have a 75% to spawn. The statues in the Chamber of Mazarbul are smashed into piles of up to 25 rocks. * 10+2d5 boulders are scattered around the level; each boulder has a 10% chance of being replaced with a rock at level creation, and all non-secret doors have a chance of being replaced with boulders. The lake that the Watcher in the Water dwells in has 'flooded' enough for the waters to reach just outside the main gate.

60% of monsters randomly generated after level creation will be orcs, and 80% of those will be Deep orcs.

In UnNetHack, Durin's Bane is found in the [[Ruins of Moria]] branch, where it will always await the player on the second level, "The Bridge of Khazad-dûm". It carries a [[wand of speed monster]], a [[cursed]] [[potion of paralysis]], and an [[enchantment|enchanted]] [[fireproof]] [[bullwhip]]; it also has a 33% chance of generating with a [[shield of reflection]].

===Strategy===
Durin's Bane has attributes almost identical to those of an ordinary balrog, but it is faster and better equipped. Like other hostile monsters, it will use its bullwhip to disarm you.

=== Encyclopedia entry ===
{{encyclopedia|<poem>
...  It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as
if a cloud had bent over it.  Then with a rush it leaped
the fissure.  The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed
about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air.  Its streaming
mane kindled, and blazed behind it.  In its right hand
was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it
held a whip of many thongs.
'Ai, ai!' wailed Legolas.  'A Balrog!  A Balrog is come!'

In dNetHack, '''Durin's Bane''' is the [[quest nemesis]] of the dwarf [[noble]] quest (Dnb). Unlike many quest nemeses in dNetHack, it is not [[covetous]] and therefore does not warp to the upstair. Durin's Bane is always equipped with a cursed +9 whip, a potion of speed, and a potion of paralysis. It also has triple the HP of most monsters of its level, so expect the battle to drag on for some time.
</simpletabs>

==Origin==
{{wikipedia}}
Durin's Bane is a [[balrog]] that appears in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', where it attacks the Fellowship as they try to pass through the halls of Moria. It is the only balrog seen and described in ''Lord of the Rings'' (though balrogs also figure in some of Tolkien's other writings, such as the ''Silmarillion'') and serves as the model for balrogs in other media, including ''[[NetHack]]'': the passage describing the encounter with Durin's Bane is used as the encyclopedia entry for "balrog" in vanilla. This is retained even in variants that add Durin's Bane, who is naturally a stronger version of vanilla's standard balrog; the balrog in turn is one of the strongest non-unique [[major demon]]s in the game.

Durin's Bane is described in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' as a vast shadowy creature with a humanoid shape and spreading "wings" - Whether these wings are physical or merely a description of its shadow is [[wikipedia:Balrog#Characteristics|up for debate]]. It wields a blazing sword in one hand and a burning whip in the other - the ''NetHack'' analogues to this are the [[broadsword]] and [[bullwhip]] that every balrog starts with.

The balrog that came to be known as "Durin's Bane" was a servant of the evil Morgoth. After Morgoth's defeat, the balrog concealed itself under the Misty Mountains, until it was disturbed or awakened by dwarves mining in their stronghold of Khazad-dûm (Moria). The dwarves gave the creature the name "Durin's Bane" after it killed their leader, Durin VI, in battle, which forced them to vacate Moria. The balrog remained in the complex after it was occupied by Sauron's [[orc]]s and [[troll]]s, and joined the occupying force in trying to kill the Fellowship of the Ring when they attempted to pass through Moria. A powerful foe, it was only defeated after a grueling fight to the death with Gandalf the Grey.

In UnNetHack, the Watcher in the Water is found on the final level of the [[Ruins of Moria]]. It is similar to an ordinary [[kraken]], but is faster, much stronger, and does not respect [[Elbereth]].

===Strategy===
The Watcher carries a [[magic lamp]] as a sort of prize for the player for reaching the end of the branch, but retrieving it can be tricky because of the Watcher's power and the fact that the lamp will fall into the water when you kill it. Here are a few ways of killing the Watcher:
*Use a [[Wand of teleportation]] on the Watcher. On dry land, the Watcher is significantly less dangerous, and killing it over land also ensures that its magic lamp can be retrieved. The amount of water in the level may necessitate using multiple charges.
*Use ranged weapons, spells, or attack wands to keep your distance and not risk getting grabbed and drowned. Note that you will likely be unable to retrieve any ammunition you use afterward.
*[[Paralyzing]] it will give you a lot of rounds to attack it in melee, but due to the Watcher's low AC and high health you likely won't kill it before it can act again unless you have a very powerful, enchanted weapon. Use a [[stethoscope]] each hit to make sure it still can't act, and keep an [[escape item]] on hand in case it grabs you!
*Wearing an [[Oilskin cloak]] or any [[greased]] cloak protects you from being drowned, but still leaves you open to the Watcher's other powerful attacks. However, as it won't follow you on land, you can simply back away from the water to heal.
*[[Polymorph]] the watcher. Whatever it polymorphs into will likely immediately drown or be much less threatening, with a few exceptions. Make sure you can deal with a possible [[Titan]] if you try this.
If you didn't kill the Watcher over dry land, you'll then have to get the lamp out of the water. This can be done by:
*Pushing boulders into the water on and around where the lamp is, then digging it out. Note that one variation of the Doors of Durin has boulders scattered around for you to use, but a [[Scroll of Earth]] may be necessary.
*Having [[magical breathing]] and jumping into the water to retrieve it. Drop anything that may be harmed by water exposure before diving in.
*Freezing the water with a [[wand of cold]] or the spell [[cone of cold]], then dig it out.
*Applying a [[bullwhip]] down while [[levitating]] or [[flying]] over the lamp will retrieve it for you.

===Encyclopedia entry===
{{Encyclopedia|
	Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it
	was pale-green and luminous and wet.  Its fingered end had
	hold of Frodo's foot, and was dragging him into the water.
	Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.  The
	arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out
	for help.  Twenty other arms came rippling out.  The dark
	water boiled, and there was a hideous stench.
