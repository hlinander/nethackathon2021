If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "The Chromatic Dragon is immune to her own breath weapons.
 You should use magic upon her that she does not use herself."
 "When you encounter the Chromatic Dragon, call upon <Anu|Ishtar> for assistance."
 "There will be nowhere to hide inside the Chromatic Dragon's inner sanctum."
 "Your best chance with the Chromatic Dragon will be to keep moving."
 "Do not be distracted by the great treasures in the Chromatic Dragon's lair.
 Concentrate on the Sceptre of Might."
 "The Sceptre of Might is the only object that the Chromatic Dragon truly fears."
 "Do not be fooled by the Chromatic Dragon's size.  She is fast, and it is
 rumored that she uses magic."
 "I would send a party of neanderthals with you, but we will need all
 of our strength to defend ourselves."
 "Remember, be <lawful|neutral> at all times.  This is your strength."
 "If only we had an amulet of reflection, this would not have happened."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 You <see|sense> many large claw marks on the ground.  The tunnels ahead
 of you are larger than most of those in any cave complex you have
 ever been in before.
 Your nose detects the smell of carrion from within, and bones litter
 the sides of the tunnels.

When returning:
 Once again, you approach the Dragon's Lair.

When first entering the goal level:
 You find yourself in a large cavern, with neatly polished walls, that
 nevertheless show signs of being scorched by fire.
 Bones litter the floor, and there are objects scattered everywhere.
 The air is close with the stench of sulphurous fumes.
 The Chromatic Dragon is clearly visible, but she seems to be asleep.

When returning:
 Once again, you find yourself in the lair of the Chromatic Dragon.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So, follower of Shaman Karnov, you seek to invade the lair of the Chromatic Dragon.
 Only my meals are allowed down here.  Prepare to be eaten!"

Upon further meetings:
 "So, again you face me, Caveman.  No one has ever before escaped me.
 Now I shall kill you."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "You are getting annoying, Caveman.  Prepare to die."

When you have the Sceptre of Might, but the Chromatic Dragon is still alive:
 "I'll have the Sceptre of Might from you, Caveman.  You shall die."

====Discouragement====

The Chromatic Dragon will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "You are weak, Caveman.  No challenge for the Mother of all Dragons."
 "I grow hungry, <currentrank>.  You look like a nice appetizer!"
 "Join me for lunch?  You're the main course, Caveman."
 "With the Sceptre of Might, I am invincible!  You cannot succeed."
 "Your mentor, Shaman Karnov has failed.  You are nothing to fear."
 "You shall die here, Caveman.  A <currentrank> cannot hope to defeat me."
 "You, a mere <currentrank> challenge the might of the Chromatic Dragon?  Hah!"
 "I am the Mother of all Dragons!  You cannot hope to defeat me."
 "<Anu|Ishtar> has deserted you, Caveman.  This is my domain."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you pick up the Sceptre of Might it seems heavy at first, but as you
 hold it strength flows into your arms.
 You suddenly feel full of power, as if nothing could possibly stand
 in your path.

When killing the nemesis:
 The Chromatic Dragon sinks to the ground, her heads flailing about.
 As she dies, a cloud of noxious fumes billows about her.

When returning to your quest leader:
 Shaman Karnov glimpses the Sceptre of Might in your possession.
 He smiles and says:
     You have done it!  We are saved.  But I fear that the Sceptre of Might
     will always be a target for chaotic forces who will want it for their
     own.
     To prevent further trouble, I would like you, <playername>,
     to take the Sceptre of Might away with you.  It will help you as you
     quest for the Amulet of Yendor.

When subsequently throwing the Sceptre of Might to Shaman Karnov:

 Shaman Karnov grasps the Sceptre of Might proudly for a moment, then looks at you.
 "You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
 for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the
 magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Shaman Karnov after the quest:
 "<playername>!  Welcome back.
 How goes your quest to recover the Amulet for <Anu|Ishtar>?"

When talking to Shaman Karnov after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "You have been successful, I see, <playername>.
 "Now that the Amulet of Yendor is yours, here is what you must do:
 "Journey upwards to the open air.  The Amulet you carry will then
 take you into the Astral Planes, where the Great Temple of <Anu|Ishtar>
 casts its influence throughout our world.
 "Sacrifice the Amulet on the altar.  Thus shall <Anu|Ishtar> become supreme!"

== Strategy ==
If you want access to the temple altar before meeting the quest requirements, have [[speed]] and walk up to Karnov and [[chat]] with him before he gets an action. This will start him wandering, and you'll be able to walk past him and reach the altar without being sent out of the level.

The easiest way to pass the tight squeezes of the home level is to put your gear into a [[bag of holding]] and throw the bag across the gaps. The bag will fit across, and the contents of a [[bag of holding]] are magically protected from breakage. If you don't have a bag of holding, you can throw your non-fragile items through the gaps, then carry the fragile ones through, provided you don't have too many of them.

There are additional random clouds to the left of the Tower and random moat squares to the right, and each square of the rectangular moat has a 2% chance to be replaced with ordinary floor. The level has undiggable walls and floor, and [[teleportation]] is permitted.

Randomly placed on the level are seven vampire bats, twelve random {{white|B}}, and eight random {{white|i}}, along with fifteen random objects. The marked trap in the innermost chamber of the Tower is an anti-magic trap; the other five traps inside the [[Tower]] are [[falling rock trap]]s, and the six outside are [[spiked pit]]s. There are an additional two [[statue trap]]s, a [[magic trap]], a [[sleeping gas trap]], a [[polymorph trap]], and three [[dart trap]]s all located randomly about the level.

Of the concentric rooms within the tower, the outermost pair each have a [[secret door]] randomly placed on one of their walls, and the third room has secret doors on the outer walls in its left third and right third; finally, the innermost room containing the down stairs has a secret door on a random wall.

===Lower filler level(s)===
As with the upper filler levels, these are "ordinary" room-and-corridor levels with six rooms. Two vampire bats, two xorns, and three random {{white|i}} are generated on level creation, along with nine random objects and four random traps.

The Dark One, with the Bell of Opening and the Eye of the Aethiopica, occupies the cross-aligned altar within the abandoned [[temple]]. The small 2x2 cells have the following peaceful occupants: a [[Rogue (player monster)|rogue]] called Pug occupies the leftmost cell on the top row, with a gnomish wizard two cells to the right, while the rightmost cell in that row is occupied by an [[owlbear]]. On the bottom row, a [[wizard (player monster)|wizard]] called Newt inhabits the left most cell, with a [[prisoner]] in the cell next to theirs; a [[hill giant]] occupies the rightmost cell on that row, with a [[Grey-Elf]] to the left of them, and a sleeping prisoner to the left of the Grey-elf. The level has an undiggable floor and walls, and teleportation is permitted.

Newt will have a [[quarterstaff]] (37.5%), an [[athame]] (37.5%), a [[long sword]] (12.5%) or a random melee weapon (12.5%), and some [[offensive item|offensive]], [[defensive item|defensive]] and [[miscellaneous item]]s.<ref>{{function|mplayer.c|mk_mplayer}}</ref> 

Eight vampire bats, eleven random {{white|B}}, and eight random {{white|i}}, all hostile, are placed randomly around the level; there are also fourteen random objects and six random traps.

==Messages==
===Transporter level===
On descending to the level where the transporter is located:
 You receive a faint telepathic message from Nefret the Green:
 Your help is urgently needed at the Lonely Tower!  Look for a ...ic transporter.
 You couldn't quite make out that last message.

===Entry===
First time:
 You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  You notice what appears to
 be a large, squat stone structure nearby.  Wait!  That looks like the
 tower of your former teacher, Neferet the Green.
 However, things are not the same as when you were last here.  Mists and
 areas of unexplained darkness surround the tower.  There is movement in
 the shadows.
 Your teacher would never allow such unaesthetic forms to surround the
 tower...  unless something were dreadfully wrong!

Next time:
 Once again, you are back at the Lonely Tower.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 You are back at the Lonely Tower.
 You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Would you happen to have some eye of newt in that overstuffed pack, <brother|sister>?"
 "Ah, the spell to create the magic portal worked.  Outstanding!"
 "Hurry!  Neferet the Green may not survive that casting of the
 portal spell!!"
 "The spells of the Dark One were just too powerful for us to withstand."
 "I, too, will venture into the world, because the Dark One is but one of
 many evils to be vanquished."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "I have some eye of newt to trade, do you have a spare blind-worm's sting?"
 "The magic portal now seems like it will remain stable for quite some time."
 "Have you noticed how much stronger Neferet the Green is since the Eye of the Aethiopica was recovered?"
 "Thank <Thoth|Anhur>!  We weren't positive you would defeat the Dark One."
 "I, too, will venture into the world, because the Dark One was but one of
 many evils to be vanquished."

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:
 "Come closer, <playername>, for my voice falters in my old age.
 Yes, I see that you have come a long way since you went out into the
 world, leaving the safe confines of this tower.  However, I must first
 determine if you have all of the skills required to take on the task
 I require of you."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Well, <playername>, you have returned.  Perhaps you are now ready..."

This message is not currently used:
 "This is getting tedious, <playername>, but perseverance is a sign of a true mage.
 I certainly hope that you are truly ready this time!"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "You fool, <playername>!  Why did I waste all of those years teaching you
 the esoteric arts?  Get out of here!  I shall find another."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Alas, <playername>, you have not yet shown your proficiency as a worthy
 spellcaster.  As a <currentrank>, you would surely be overcome in the challenge
 ahead.  Go, now, expand your horizons, and return when you have attained
 renown as an Enchanter."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "You amaze me, <playername>!  How many times did I tell you that the way of a mage
 is an exacting one.  One must use the world with care, lest one leave it
 in ruins and simplify the task of the Dark One.
 "You must go back and show your worthiness.  Do not return until you are
 truly ready for this quest.  May <Thoth|Anhur> guide you in this task."

When finally assigned the quest:
 "Yes, <playername>, you truly are ready for this dire task.  Listen,
 carefully, for what I tell you now will be of vital importance.
 "Since you left us to hone your skills in the world, we unexpectedly came
 under attack by the forces of the Dark One.  As you know, we thought
 the Dark One had perished at the end of the last age, but, alas, this was
 not the case.
 "The Dark One sent an army of abominations against us.  Among them was a
 minion, mindless and ensorcelled, and thus, in the confusion, it was able
 to penetrate our defenses.  Alas, this creature has stolen
 the Eye of the Aethiopica and I fear it has delivered the Eye of the Aethiopica
 to the Dark One.
 "Over the years, I had woven most of my power into this amulet, and thus,
 without it, I have but a shadow of my former power, and I fear that I
 shall soon perish.
 "You must travel to the Tower of Darkness, and within its dungeons, 
 find and overcome the Dark One, and return the Eye of the Aethiopica to me.
 "Go now, with <Thoth|Anhur>, and complete this quest before it is too late."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "Beware, for the Dark One is immune to most magical attacks."
 "To enter the Tower of Darkness you must pass many traps."
 "The Dark One may be vulnerable to physical attacks."
 "<Thoth|Anhur> will come to your aid when you call."
 "You must utterly destroy the Dark One.  He will pursue you otherwise."
 "The Eye of the Aethiopica is a mighty artifact.  With it you can
 destroy the Dark One."
 "Go forth with the blessings of <Thoth|Anhur>."
 "I will have my apprentices watch for your return."
 "Feel free to take any items in that chest that might aid you."
 "You will know when the Eye of the Aethiopica is near.  Proceed with care!"

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 Wisps of fog swirl nearby.  You feel that the Dark One's lair is close.

When returning:
 You believe that you may once again invade the Tower of Darkness.

When first entering the goal level:
 You feel your mentor's presence; perhaps the Eye of the Aethiopica is nearby.

When returning:
 The aura of the Eye of the Aethiopica tingles at the edge of your perception.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "Ah, I recognize you, <playername>.  So, Neferet the Green has sent you to steal
 the Eye of the Aethiopica from me, hmmm?  Well, Neferet the Green is a
 fool to send such a mental weakling against me.
 "Your destruction, however, should make for good sport.  In the end, you
 shall beg me to kill you!"

Upon further meetings:
 "How nice of you to return, <playername>!  I enjoyed our last meeting.  Are you
 still hungry for more pain?
 "Come!  Your soul, like the Eye of the Aethiopica, shall soon be mine to
 command."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "I'm sure that your perseverance shall be the subject of innumerable
 ballads, but you shall not be around to hear them, I fear!"

When you have the Eye of the Aethiopica, but the Dark One is still alive:
 "Thief!  The Eye of the Aethiopica belongs to me, now.  I shall feed
 your living flesh to my minions."

====Discouragement====

The Dark One will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "Your puny powers are no match for me, fool!"
 "When you are defeated, your torment will last for a thousand years."
 "After your downfall, <playername>, I shall devour Neferet the Green
 for dessert!"
 "Are you ready yet to beg for mercy?  I could be lenient..."
 "Your soul shall join the enslaved multitude I command!"
 "Your lack of will is evident, and you shall die as a result."
 "Your faith in <Thoth|Anhur> is for naught!  Come, submit to me now!"
 "A mere <currentrank> is nothing compared to my skill!"
 "So, you are the best hope of Neferet the Green?  How droll."
 "Feel my power, Wizard!  My victory is imminent!"

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you touch the Eye of the Aethiopica, its comforting power infuses you
 with new energy.  You feel as if you can detect others' thoughts flowing
 through it.  Although you yearn to wear the Eye of the Aethiopica
 and attack the Wizard of Yendor, you know you must return it to its
 rightful owner, Neferet the Green.

When killing the nemesis:
 The Dark One croaks out, as his body begins to shrivel up:
     I shall haunt your progress until the end of time.  A thousand
     curses on you and Neferet the Green.
 Then, the body bursts into a cloud of choking dust, and blows away.

When returning to your quest leader:
 Neferet the Green notices the Eye of the Aethiopica in your possession,
 beams at you and says:
    I knew you could defeat the Dark One and retrieve
    the Eye of the Aethiopica.  We shall never forget this
    brave service.
    Take the Eye of the Aethiopica with you in your quest for
    the Amulet of Yendor.  I can sense that it has attuned
    itself to you already.
    May <Thoth|Anhur> guide you in your quest, and keep you from harm.

When subsequently throwing the Eye of the Aethiopica to Neferet the Green:
 "You are the keeper of the Eye of the Aethiopica now.  It is time to
 recover the /other/ Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through
 the magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Neferet the Green after the quest:
 "Come near, my <son|daughter>, and share your adventures with me.
 So, have you succeeded in your quest for the Amulet of Yendor?"

When talking to Neferet the Green after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Congratulations, <playername>.  I always knew that if anyone could succeed
 in defeating the Wizard of Yendor and his minions, it would be you.
 "Go now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
 the Amulet on the altar of <Thoth|Anhur>.  Along the way you shall pass through the
 four elemental planes.  These planes are like nothing you have ever
 experienced before, so be prepared!
 "For this you were born, <brother|sister>!  I am very proud of you."

==Strategy==
Due to the limited number of trap types available on the home level, there is a high chance that one of the random traps will be a polymorph trap - be prepared for a small chance of encountering an out-of-depth monster. The locate level moat has a very low chance to be generated in a way that blocks off the tower without some form of bridging<!-- .98 ^ 104, less than .0125% --> - while useful to have a backup crossing method for these occasions, it is usually not necessary.

The [[player monster]]s Newt and Pug on the goal level are likely to have several useful items: Newt in particular is a source of an athame. Players seeking their inventory (e.g., [[atheist]] Wizards who cannot obtain [[Magicbane]] via sacrifice gift) should use a [[pet]] kill them if possible, both to preserve their offensive items and avoid [[alignment record]] and [[murder]] penalties.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and prior versions, alongside some variants based on them, the Eye grants magic resistance when carried and generates at the Dark One's feet instead of in his inventory; a quiet player could sneak up on him and zap him with a [[wand of death]] while he was still vulnerable. In current versions, the Eye grants magic resistance only while worn - as the Dark One will not wear it, he is ridiculously easy to kill in this manner without stealth.

===Entry===
First time:
 You are suddenly surrounded by stinking mists. Ah! The smell of home!
 However, things are not the same as when you were last here.  You hear
 demoniac cackling from all around, and the dry, rustling flap of
 leathery wings.
 You know the Dark Lord would never allow such creatures to approach the
 tower...  unless something were dreadfully wrong!

Next time:
 Once again, you are back at the Tower of the Dark Lord.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 You are back at the Tower of the Dark Lord.
 You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Would you happen to have some eye of newt in that overstuffed pack, <brother|sister>?"
 "Ah, the spell to create the magic portal worked.  Outstanding!"
 "Hurry!  The Dark Lord may not survive that casting of the
 portal spell!!"
 "We must strive to destroy that bloodless demon, or all is lost."
 "I, too, will venture into the world, because Maugneshaagar is but one of
 many demons to be vanquished."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Would you happen to have some eye of newt in that overstuffed pack, <brother|sister>?"
 "Ah, the spell to create the magic portal worked.  Outstanding!"
 "I, too, will venture into the world, because Maugneshaagar was but one of
 many demons to be vanquished."
 "Yes! I have been rostered the graveyard shift this week!"
 "I wonder how Doctor Frankenstein's work progresses?"

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:
 "Come closer, <playername>, for my voice falters in my old age.
 Yes, I see that you have come a long way since you went out into the
 world, leaving the confines of this tower.  However, I must first
 determine if you have all of the skills required to take on the task
 I require of you."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Well, <playername>, you have returned.  Perhaps you are now ready..."

This message is not currently used:
 "This is getting tedious, <playername>, but perseverance is a sign of a true mage.
 I certainly hope that you are truly ready this time!"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "You fool, <playername>!  Why did I waste all of those years teaching you
 the dark arts?  Get out of here!  I shall find another."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Alas, <playername>, you have not yet shown your proficiency as a worthy
 spellcaster.  As a <currentrank>, you would surely be overcome in the challenge
 ahead.  Go, now, expand your horizons, and return when you have attained
 renown as a Ghoul Master."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "You amaze me, <playername>!  How many times did I tell you that sorcery
 requires care.  maintain the balance of darkness within oneself,
 lest one leave it in ruins and simplify the task of Maugneshaagar.
 "You must go back and show your worthiness.  Do not return until you are
 truly ready for this quest.  May Gothuulbe guide you in this task."

When finally assigned the quest:
 "Yes, <playername>, you truly are ready for this dire task.  Listen,
 carefully, for what I tell you now will be of vital importance.
 "Since you left us to hone your skills in the world, we unexpectedly came
 under attack by the forces of Maugneshaagar.  As you know, we thought
 Maugneshaagar had perished at the end of the last age, but, alas, this was
 not the case.
 "Maugneshaagar sent an army of abominations against us.  Among them was a
 minion, mindless and ensorcelled, and thus, in the confusion, it was able
 to penetrate our defenses.  Alas, this creature has stolen
 the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa and I fear it has delivered the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa 
 to Maugneshaagar.
 "You must travel to the Lair of Maugneshaagar, and within its dungeons, 
 find and overcome Maugneshaagar, and return the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  to me.
 "Go now, with Gothuulbe, and return freedom to our tower."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "Beware, for Maugneshaagar is immune to most magical attacks."
 "To enter the Lair of Maugneshaagar you must pass many traps."
 "Maugneshaagar may be vulnerable to physical attacks."
 "Gothuulbe will come to your aid when you call."
 "You must utterly destroy Maugneshaagar.  He will pursue you otherwise."
 "The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  is a mighty artifact.  With it you can
 destroy Maugneshaagar."
 "Go forth with the blessings of Gothuulbe."
 "I will have my embalmers watch for your return."
 "Feel free to take any items in that chest that might aid you."
 "You will know when the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  is near.  Proceed with care!"

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 Wisps of dark mist swirl nearby.  You feel that Maugneshaagar's lair is close.

When returning:
 You believe that you may once again invade the Lair of Maugneshaagar.

When first entering the goal level:
 You feel your mentor's presence; perhaps the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  is nearby.

When returning:
 The aura of the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  tingles at the edge of your perception.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "Ah, I recognize you, <playername>.  So, the Dark Lord has sent you to steal
 the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  from me, hmmm?  Well, the Dark Lord is a
 fool to send such a mental weakling against me.
 "Your destruction, however, should make for good sport.  In the end, you
 shall beg me to kill you!"

Upon further meetings:
 "How nice of you to return, <playername>!  I enjoyed our last meeting.  Are you
 still hungry for more pain?
 "Come!  Your soul, like the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa , shall soon be mine to
 command."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "I'm sure that your perseverance shall be the subject of innumerable
 ballads, but you shall not be around to hear them, I fear!"

When you have the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa , but Maugneshaagar is still alive:
 "Thief!  The Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  belongs to me, now.  I shall feed
 your living flesh to my minions."

====Discouragement====

Maugneshaagar will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "Your puny powers are no match for me, fool!"
 "When you are defeated, your torment will last for a thousand years."
 "After your downfall, <playername>, I shall devour the Dark Lord
 for dessert!"
 "Are you ready yet to beg for mercy?  I could be lenient..."
 "Your soul shall join the enslaved multitude I command!"
 "Your lack of will is evident, and you shall die as a result."
 "Your faith in Gothuulbe is for naught!  Come, submit to me now!"
 "A mere <currentrank> is nothing compared to my skill!"
 "So, you are the best hope of the Dark Lord?  How droll."
 "Feel my power, Necromancer!  My victory is imminent!"

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you touch the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa, its comforting power infuses you
 with new energy.  Although you yearn to use the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa
 to attack the Wizard of Yendor, you know you must return it to its
 rightful owner, the Dark Lord.

When killing the nemesis:
 Maugneshaagar croaks out, as his body begins to shrivel up:
     I shall haunt your progress until the end of time.  A thousand
     curses on you and the Dark Lord.
 Then, the body bursts into a cloud of choking dust, and blows away.

When returning to your quest leader:
 The Dark Lord notices the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  in your possession,
 beams at you and says:
    I knew you could defeat Maugneshaagar and retrieve
    the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa .  We shall never forget this
    brave service.
    Take the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  with you in your quest for
    the Amulet of Yendor.  I can sense that it has attuned
    its dark mind to you already.
    May Gothuulbe guide you in your quest, and keep you from harm.

When subsequently throwing the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa to the Dark Lord:
 The Dark Lord handles the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa for a moment, then looks at you.
 "You are the keeper of the Great Dagger of Glaurgnaa  now.  It is time to
 resume your search for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through
 the magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to the Dark Lord after the quest:
 "Come near, my <son|daughter>, and share your adventures with me.
 So, have you succeeded in your quest for the Amulet of Yendor?"

When talking to the Dark Lord after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Congratulations, <playername>.  I always knew that if anyone could succeed
 in defeating the Wizard of Yendor and his minions, it would be you.
 "Go now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
 the Amulet on the altar of Gothuulbe.  Along the way you shall pass through the
 four elemental planes.  These planes are like nothing you have ever
 experienced before, so be prepared!
 "For this you were born, <brother|sister>!  I am very proud of you."

The two-way magic portal back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point to top left. Van Helsing is next to the unaligned altar, with a chest next to him; eight acolytes are also in the room, which is considered a desecrated temple. There are twelve human zombies surrounding the Temple. In addition to the two marked dart traps inside the doors, there are four random other traps on the level.
The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls and floor.

The above core of the level is surrounded by empty ground, containing the upstair a little way to the right of the mapped area. The unaligned temple has both its attendant priest and another, hostile, priest of Moloch. The entire mapped area outside the crypt is a graveyard, filled with the usual assortment of undead. In addition to the boxes of the graveyard, the four corner chambers of the crypt each contain four random objects (except the NW, which contains 3); each also contains a marked random trap, and there are two other random traps located in the mapped area.
The entire level has undiggable walls and floor. Teleportation is permitted.

===Lower filler level(s)===

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You find yourself standing in sight of the Temple of Light.  Something
 is obviously wrong here.  The holy light that usually fills the sky
 is gone, and strange human shapes shamble around outside.
 You realize that Van Helsing needs your assistance!

Next time:
 Once again, you stand before the Temple of Light.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again you face the Temple of Light.  Your intuition hints that this may be
 the final time you come here.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Greetings, <currentrank>.  It is good to see you."
 "Ah, <playername>!  Surely you can help us in our hour of need."
 "Greetings, <brother|sister>.  Van Helsing has great need of your help."
 "Alas, it seems as if even <deity> has deserted us."
 "May <deity> be with you, <brother|sister>."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Greetings, <currentrank>.  It is good to see you again."
 "May <deity> be with you, <brother|sister>."
 "Have you heard the rumors about the vampire known as 'The Day Walker'
 that stalks his own breed?"
 "With Count Dracula destroyed, we are safe once more!"
 "I hear you are to be nominated as next leader of the order!"

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 "Ah, <playername>, my <son|daughter>.  You have returned to us at last.
 A great blow has befallen our order; perhaps you can help us.
 First, however, I must determine if you are prepared for this
 great challenge."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Again, my <son|daughter>, you stand before me.  Are you ready now to help us?"

This message is not currently used:

 "Once more, <playername>, you stand within the sanctum.  Are you ready now?"

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "You are a heretic, <playername>!  How can you, a <currentrank>, deviate so from the
 teachings of <deity>?  Begone from this temple.  You are no longer
 a <brother|sister> to this order.  We will pray to <deity> for other assistance,
 as you have failed us utterly."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "Alas, <playername>, it is not yet to be.  A mere <currentrank> could never
 withstand the might of Count Dracula.  Go forth, again into the world, and return
 when you have attained the post of Exterminator."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
