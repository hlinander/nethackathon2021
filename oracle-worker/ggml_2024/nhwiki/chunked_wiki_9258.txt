* The [[Amulet of Yendor]] blocks all forms of [[teleportation]].
* Killing the [[quest leader]] will remove the mysterious force preventing access to the rest of the quest.
* Deadly [[poison]] no longer instantly kills the player character, but instead causes both HP and attribute damage.
* #give can be used to give items to the player's pet or [[peaceful]] monsters, putting the items directly in their inventory. This streamlines the process of enticing pets to wield weapons or put on armor.
* [[Artifact]] [[wish]]ing is based on the number of artifacts wished for, not the number of artifacts generated, preventing the increased number of artifacts from making artifact wishing more difficult.

== Object changes ==
* [[Pickaxe]]s weigh less.
* [[Robe]]s are now referred to as mystic robes, and robe is a wishable category of item.
* Additional types of items can be poisoned.
* Warhammers deal 1d12 damage.
* The dungeon contains [[furnace]]s in addition to the usual fountains and sinks.

== Monster changes ==
* Unique demons are more dangerous, as detailed on their own [[SpliceHack/Unique_demons|subpage]].
* [[Tiger]]s and [[demons|demonic monsters]] have had their colors changed in order to make room for new monsters.
* [[Zruty|Zruties]] have been moved to the [[Apelike creature|Y]] monster class in order to allow for [[zouthern animals]].
* [[Bones]] files of players that were level 15 or above contain a [[spectre]] instead of a ghost.
* The [[Wizard of Yendor]] has a weapon attack.
* [[Yeenoghu]] wields a triple flail, giving him a much higher damage output.
* [[Giant]]s and [[ogre king]]s can rarely knock the player back with their attacks.
* Most [[mummies]] can inflict the [[withering]] status effect on enemies that they attack in melee.
* [[Ice devils]] can inflict [[fumbling]] on the player.
* Monsters are unaffected by the mysterious force.
* Glowing monsters tend to emit more light.
* Monsters with "lord" and "king" in their names have dynamically created gender variants.
* Balrogs emit smoke, and carry a flaming lash.
* Piranhas devour corpses.

== Monster AI changes ==
All monsters in SpliceHack are smarter and make more effective use of items than their vanilla counterparts.
* SpliceHack implements an updated version of the intelligent pet patch, from [[GruntHack]]. This means that monsters will cast spells at one another, use ranged attacks against other monsters, and make more intelligent use of items.
* Monsters now use a wider variety of items, including (but not limited to) applying figurines, sacrificing corpses on altars, and playing instruments. They are even capable of making wishes from smoky potions.
* Monsters are capable of [[riding]] other monsters. The movement speed of the rider is not changed based on the steed. This feature was later ported to [[EvilHack]].
* Some monsters can call out to others of their kind, alerting them to the presence of the player.
* Monsters that eat corpses can gain [[intrinsic]]s, just like the player does.
* Monsters are capable of gaining [[displacement]], [[jumping]], [[water walking]], and [[teleportitis]].
* Monsters can be [[stun]]ned or turned [[invisible]] by eating corpses.

== Gehennom changes ==
* Monsters do not leave corpses in Gehennom.
* Many domestic and mundane monsters are converted to their hellish counterparts in Gehennom. For example, kittens spawn as hellcats.

== Ascension run changes ==
The endgame of SpliceHack is designed to be more hectic than vanilla.
* While the player character has the Amulet of Yendor, many monsters are generated awake.
* Upon performing the invocation ritual, all [[demon prince]]s and [[demon lord]]s that have not yet been generated will spawn somewhere in the dungeon. This means that a player will almost definitely encounter [[Demogorgon]] in the course of ascension.
* The [[Astral Plane]] is populated by more player monsters than in vanilla. Due to the increased number of artifacts, it is more likely than in vanilla that you will encounter player monsters with artifact weapons.
* All [[player monster]]s are capable of stealing the Amulet from the player. If they succeed in stealing it, they will flee. Should a monster manage to make it to a coaligned high altar with the Amulet, they will sacrifice it, causing you to lose the game.

== Racial changes ==
* Dwarves start the game with booze, and their pickaxes are replaced with mattocks.
* Chaotic archeologists are considered valid, and begin the game with a pair of pistols.

== Shopkeepers ==
* Shopkeepers offer services, like in SLASH'EM.
* Shopkeepers may have better equipment.

A '''playing card deck''' is a [[tool]] from [[SpliceHack]]. When unidentified, it appears as a '''pack of cards'''. It allows the player to evaluate their [[Luck]]. It shares its appearance with the dangerous [[deck of fate]].

A noncursed playing card deck will produce the following results:

{|class="prettytable"
!Luck
!Message
|-
| Luck <= 0
| "You draw a hand of five cards. It's not very good..."
|-
| 0 < Luck < 5
| "You draw a hand of five cards. Two pair!"
|-
| 5 < Luck < 13
| "You draw a hand of five cards. Full house!"
|-
| Luck >= 13
| "You draw a hand of five cards. Wow, a royal flush!"
|}

If the deck is blessed, the message will identify a high card or kicker with a face value equal to your current Luck, if it is above zero. For example, when used by a character with a Luck of 12: "You draw a hand of five cards. Full house! The high card is the queen of clubs." A cursed deck will produce the results in reverse, giving a royal flush at Luck <= 0 and a bad hand at Luck >= 13.

[[Cartomancer|Cartomancers]] can use all playing card decks as if they were blessed.

A playing card deck can also be used to bribe lawful [[demon princes]] in [[Gehennom]]. The demon will offer to play cards with you if they notice a deck in your inventory. If the result of a d13 is greater than or equal to your Luck, they will "crush the deck" (which oddly does not destroy it) and become hostile. Otherwise, they will congratulate you on winning, then disappear.

* [[playing card deck]]
* [[deck of fate]]

All decks weigh 10. The playing card deck costs 80 [[zorkmids]] and the deck of fate costs 300.

While the playing card deck is a mundane item, the deck of fate can be very risky to draw cards from.

All decks are treated as blessed when used by a [[Cartomancer]].

There's a bug on the [[Price identification]] article : <nowiki>{{of|potion|ESP}}</nowiki> gives {{of|potion|ESP}} and not [[Potion of ESP|ESP]]. Regards, [[User:Willful|Willful]] ([[User talk:Willful|talk]]) 06:24, 5 November 2019 (UTC)
: Thanks for letting me know. Normally it changes the first letter of the second parameter to lowercase (so you can use e.g. <tt><nowiki>{{of|potion|Booze}}</nowiki></tt> to produce <tt><nowiki>[[potion of booze|Booze]]</nowiki></tt> rather than <tt><nowiki>[[potion of Booze|Booze]]</nowiki></tt>), but it didn't account for cases where the capitalization needs to stay. I've added a fix for when the second parameter is "ESP", which will hopefully be enough for now. — [[User:Ardub23|Ardub23]] ([[User talk:Ardub23|talk]]) 03:41, 6 November 2019 (UTC)

== Is a template named just "of" really the best choice for general wiki use? ==

It's really jarring for me to read some page source and come across this template being used, because it breaks the semantic order.

Proposal: follow the example already used in [[Template:Spell of]], and create templates for the various object classes that heavily use "of" in their naming. E.g.
 <nowiki>{{potion of|speed}} --> [[potion of speed|speed]]</nowiki>

In order to avoid duplicating code, those templates can internally use this one. E.g. the "potion of" template would be
 <nowiki>{{of|potion|{{{1}}}}}</nowiki>

but the main text of this template should discourage general wiki use of it.

I think we can discard any special casing for the Amulet of Yendor; I doubt a scenario would arise where someone would want to have [[Amulet of Yendor|Yendor]] in their page without having the "Amulet of" in it.

'''The [[DevTeam]] Office''' is a single-level [[dungeon branch]] in [[The November NetHack Tournament]], added in 2018. It is accessible via a second up staircase on the [[Rogue level]]. It is the home of the dev team and the associated quest, and also serves as a convenient location to [[branchport]] [[wraith]]s to from the [[Valley of the Dead]].

Mike Stephenson sits on a [[throne]]. The marked spellbooks are a [[spellbook of detect monsters]], [[spellbook of light]] and [[spellbook of detect unseen]], shuffled randomly and randomly assigned the names 'grep', 'ls' and 'htop'. Each has a 30% chance to appear. The marked statue is of a [[balrog]] named The [[RNG]]. The marked {{brown|)}} is a [[rubber hose]], [[grappling hook]] and/or [[tin opener]]; each has a 30% chance to appear. The snack area contains a [[candy bar]], an [[apple]] and a [[banana]]. The novel has a 20% chance to appear. In addition to the marked monsters, there may be a [[lizard]] named The Lizard of Yendor and/or a [[troll]] named MR SHOUTY placed randomly; all monsters are named and generated [[peaceful]], and each besides the dev team has a 20% chance to appear.

The marked chest contains a guaranteed blessed [[scroll of identify]] and 1-2 random uncursed [[scroll]]s, but accessing it requires either teleporting it away from the disposal area or crossing the [[lava]].

==The DevTeam's quest==

When [[chat]]ting to Mike Stephenson, he will ask [[you]] to find three [[Scroll of missing code|scrolls of missing code]] scattered around the [[Dungeons of Doom]]. These scrolls have the non-randomized label of 'PLZ RETURN TO DEVTEAM' and can generate in any open space, including corridors and shops. Chat with Mike again or [[throw]] them to return the scrolls. Once a scroll has been returned, he can also tell you on which level another scroll is hidden. Giving him all of the scrolls rewards you with the [[Really Cool Shirt]], an artifact [[T-shirt]], provided you did not personally kill [[Izchak]]<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/commit/a5c32f85914f68e31c4eed661efea9a9a41e3a62</ref>.

Like all other scrolls, the missing code scrolls are susceptible to fire and water. Hiding them in a container is advised. Also, be very careful not to anger the [[devteam member]]s; they are extremely powerful and can displace monsters like the [[Riders]] do. In addition, if a devteam member dies, [[Instadeath|the game immediately ends]]; [[life saving]] will not protect you.

==Messages==
{{message|You hear a nearby typing noise.}}
{{message|You hear people arguing about game balance..}}
{{message|You hear a voice say "<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[next version]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>".|You are on the Rogue level.}}
{{message|You hear an infinite number of monkeys arguing about the script for Hamlet|You are [[hallucinating]] on the Rogue level.}}
{{message|You arrive to a place bustling with activity and excitement.}}
{{message|You notice several people mumbling incoherently, something to do about 'the [[source code]]'.|You enter the office.}}

==History==

In 2021, all objects and monsters marked on the map were guaranteed, and the chest contained two additional uncursed scrolls of identify instead of random scrolls. Most of them were removed to reduce the effect of this level on game balance and on how easy certain [[The November NetHack Tournament#Scoring|achievement]]s were<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/commit/006f5037933b5087bd479863f3b3d055da9e5ca0</ref>.

In 2021, only killing a devteam member yourself ended the game; instadeath did not occur if they somehow killed themselves or were killed by another monster<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/commit/b76a81072326908ab35eec4cd2e175c7accc98e2</ref>.

==Trivia==
* The sequence of events that occurs when you kill a devteam member is probably a reference to the [[panic]] handler: 'Suddenly, the dungeon collapses.'

'''Devteam members''' are representations of the [[DevTeam]] in [[The November NetHack Tournament]]. They reside in [[the DevTeam Office]], a special optional [[dungeon branch]], and will give [[you]] a quest to find three [[Scroll of missing code|scrolls of missing code]] in exchange for the [[Really Cool Shirt]]. For more information, see the [[DevTeam Office]] article.

Be very careful not to anger the dev team, as they are very powerful and can displace monsters as the [[Riders]] do. In addition, if a devteam member dies, [[Instadeath|the game immediately ends]]; [[life saving]] will not protect you.

Devteam members are [[Monster starting inventory|generated with]] a [[long sword]] or [[katana]], a [[shield of reflection]], [[leather gloves]], [[high boots]] and an [[elven mithril-coat]] or [[dwarvish mithril-coat]].

The '''Giant praying mantis''', {{green|a}}, is a [[monster]] in [[SpliceHack]]. Giant praying mantises do not respect [[Elbereth]].

== Messages ==

Instead of trying to attack a [[prayer|praying]] player and pulling back, a giant praying mantis will "bow its head in prayer."

The '''brood wasp''', {{brightblue|a}}, is a [[defunct features (SpliceHack)|defunct]] monster in [[SpliceHack]], which has since been replaced by [[ichneumon]]. Brood wasps were very fast, and possessed attacks that were very dangerous to unprepared players.

Upon hitting a player that is not [[thick-skinned]] with its inject larvae attack, there was a one in four chance that the brood wasp injected larvae into the creature. This was denoted by the message <code>The brood wasp injects something into you!</code>. 100-300 turns later, the player would take 10d4 damage as 2-4 '''baby brood wasps''' hatch from their body. Carrying brood wasp larvae was considered a [[major trouble]] for purposes of [[prayer]], and could be cured via application of a [[unicorn horn]].

Brood wasps and players [[polymorph|polymorphed]] into brood wasps had a one in four chance of injecting larvae upon hitting a monster with 5 or less hit points. Upon doing so, if the attacker was the player, a [[tame]] baby brood wasp would be created. Otherwise, the monster was instantly slain.

== Strategy ==
Due to their high speed, poisonous sting, and ability to create tame monsters, a brood wasp could be a useful monster to polymorph into, especially in the early game.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|	These insects are feared for their ability to lay eggs inside
	the bodies of their prey.}}

'''Drauglir''', {{magenta|d}}, is a [[defunct features (SpliceHack)|defunct]] unique [[monster]] in [[SpliceHack]]. He was encountered in '''The Dark Forest'''. Unlike most [[lycanthropes]], Drauglir did not have a human form.

All sins were [[unique monster|unique]] and only encountered in the [[endgame]]. Each of the [[Elemental planes|planes]] contained one of the seven sins, determined randomly, at a random location. Fighting them was optional, and it was generally preferable to avoid them, due to their high level and exceedingly nasty attacks.

All of the sins were capable of following the player through [[portal]]s.

'''Wrath''' was a dangerous physical combatant with a high damage output. He was [[fast]], able to [[jump]], and could hit the player from two squares away using his spiked chain. Due to his high speed and varied forms of movement, Wrath was one of the sins it is more likely for the player to encounter.

Wrath was generated with the following items:

* 20 [[knife|knives]]
* Plate mail
* Spiked chain. This spiked chain is made of whatever material the player's [[race]] is vulnerable to, if any.

'''Envy''' was the most frequently encountered of the sins, and potentially the most annoying for the player.

A '''flintlock''' is a [[firearm]] specific to [[dNetHack]].  [[Pirate]]s start with a +0 flintlock.  Because of its negative rate of fire, it will not normally fire more than one [[bullet]] even at expert [[skill]].  Furthermore, bullets fired from a flintlock have a 1 in 7 chance to misfire as if they were [[cursed]].  However, it is the only firearm that is not considered [[Anachrononaut#Future Tech|future tech]] and is thus [[wish]]able.

== Bribery ==
[[Bribing]] a lawful [[demon prince]] is similar to ''NetHack'', but with a few key differences. The demon will cycle through the following checks in order.

# If the player has a [[playing card deck]] in their inventory, the demon will offer to play a game of chance with the player for dominion of their soul. If the player refuses, the demon will get angry.
# If the player has a powerful object in their inventory, the demon lord may demand it in exchange for safe passage. Objects demanded include any [[artifact]] (except [[Sting]], [[Orcrist]], and those necessary for [[ascension]]), a [[bag of holding]], or a [[wand of wishing]].
# If the player does not have a powerful object or refuses to hand it over, the demon will demand a monetary bribe of 2000&ndash;3000 [[zorkmid]]s, with an additional 1000 demanded if the player is of a different [[alignment]] to the demon. If the demon is in possession of the [[Amulet of Yendor]] or the hero is deaf, a sum of money greater than the amount in the player's inventory is demanded.

== Dark speech ==
All hostile unique demons are capable of using '''dark speech'''. Each turn, there is a {{frac|1|18}} chance that the demon utters something in the dark speech. If the player does not have sonic resistance and is not [[deaf]], one of several effects will occur.

&&%s&& %s Withering {148664 2022-10-06T13:42:02Z {4000203 Frozty} EvilHack Withering '''Withering''' is a status effect in [[SpliceHack]] that affects the player's hit points. Withering has different effects depending on whether the player has [[regeneration]]. Withering is considered a [[major trouble]], and can be removed via application of a [[unicorn horn]] or [[prayer]].

{|class="prettytable"
!Status
!Effect
|-
|Regeneration
|Player does not regain hit points at an accelerated rate.
|-
|No regeneration
|Player loses one hit point per turn, does not regain hit points naturally.
|}

Monsters afflicted with withering lose one hit point per turn.

==Other Variants==
Withering also occurs in [[EvilHack]]. However it cannot be cured with a unicorn horn. Prayer, quaffing a blessed [[potion of extra healing]] or a non-cursed [[potion of full healing]] will remove withering. However, in EvilHack withering is not perpetual or even necessarily long-lived, and will time out on its own. Wither time is dependent on how much damage the withering attack did, minimum being two turns. The wither time can stack if you're hit repeatedly with a withering attack before it wears off, and can last much longer if caused by a high-level monster.
