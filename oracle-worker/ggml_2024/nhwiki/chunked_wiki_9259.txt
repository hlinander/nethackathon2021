The '''deathmatch''' is an optional quest that takes place in a special dungeon branch, the '''deathmatch arena''', in [[The November NetHack Tournament]], added in 2019. It challenges [[you]] to fight a [[player monster]] representing a previously [[ascended]] character. The arena is accessible via a [[magic portal]] on the level immediately above [[Medusa's Island]]<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/c5d2fa2f4aee18b58c18c827adbd722c2830dea5/dat/dungeon.def#L31</ref>.

The deathmatch opponent has the name, [[role]], [[gender]], [[experience level]], [[hit points]], some [[intrinsic]] resistances, and inventory of a random previously-ascended character on the system. Multiple players may end up fighting the same opponent. Their level will be raised to 14 if it was below that, and their hit points will be clamped to a minimum of 100 + [level]d10 + d30, a hard minimum of 200 and a maximum of 500. Contents of containers and names of items are not preserved, [[Wand of wishing|wands of wishing]], [[magic lamp]]s and [[unique item]]s are removed, and all [[artifact]]s will be converted to ordinary [[base item]]s.<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/094682c847645ffcaed475830c6ff0a4d0a07cab/src/files.c#L4670</ref>

Monsters cannot enter or leave the arena through the portal<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/6bc13a816b89225498353c9eada0aca27b76aa97/src/teleport.c#L1382</ref> or by following [[you]]<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/a8d76e50f64ee71a882efb796b4cdc67e74bcb99/src/do.c#L1350</ref>. Because of this, a character carrying the [[Eye of the Aethiopica]] can [[branchport]] here to escape [[follower]]s such as [[Demogorgon]]. You cannot enter the deathmatch arena before starting the deathmatch itself if you are carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]], or any [[invocation]] items before performing the invocation. The level is no-teleport.

The opponent will be generated [[asleep]], but will awaken once you move onto the space with the door. Once the opponent has awoken, you cannot [[branchport]] out of the arena until they are killed. Contrary to the engravings on the ground, you ''can'' leave through the portal; however, if you leave while your opponent is still alive, the portal will be removed and branchporting back in will become impossible<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/6bc13a816b89225498353c9eada0aca27b76aa97/src/teleport.c#L1063</ref>. There is no penalty for leaving the arena before the opponent has awoken, or after they are killed.

When the opponent is killed, their possessions will coalesce on the ground where they died. These objects are '''transient''': you will be able to pick up one of them; once you do, the others vanish. [[Autopickup]] will not pick up these objects. This includes any weapons or ammo that were thrown at you by the opponent, and anything you [[Theft (attack)|stole]] from them. If you leave the deathmatch arena after starting the deathmatch, all of these objects will disappear except for the one you took after winning; be sure to do so before leaving.

If no player has ascended yet, a generic player monster will be created instead. Their inventory will not be transient as that of a normal deathmatch opponent is.

==Strategy==

{{stub}}

The deathmatch opponent will very likely have several attack wands, including at least one [[wand of death]]. [[Magic resistance]] or [[reflection]] is practically required to survive the match, and a defense against [[petrification]] is also advisable. Death magic and other attack wands will likely be ineffective against them.

The deathmatch opponent may be wielding a [[cockatrice corpse]] or chickatrice corpse. If they are, they may kill themselves by falling into [[pit]]s. If they do not, you should stay away from them until the corpse rots away. This will prompt them to wield another weapon. A cockatrice corpse may be used to kill the opponent, but it will take several hits to burn through their lizard corpses. Ascending characters often have extremely high AC, so landing a hit will be difficult. Be careful not to fall into a pit yourself. 

When choosing which object to take, consider that they may have been used by the ascending player. A [[magic marker]] may already be permanently dried out. Unfortunately, you cannot safely pick up the objects in order to [[identify]] them.

==Messages==

{{message|You hear the roaring of a crowd.}}
{{message|You hear the clash of steel on steel.|You are on the level with the deathmatch portal.}}
{{message|Upon exiting the portal, you immediately feel on edge.  You feel as if you've stumbled across something very dangerous.  You resist the urge to flee.|You entered the arena for the first time.}}
{{message|A voice echoes in the arena:  "Thou art brave indeed, mortal! Now prove thy prowess!"|The deathmatch has started.}}
{{message|Loud booing follows you out of the arena...|You left the arena during the deathmatch.}}
{{message|A voice echoes in the arena:  "Choose thy trophy from the spoils!"|The opponent was killed.}}
{{message|You see [the opponent's] possessions coalesce into a large pile near you.|The opponent was killed.}}
{{message|You hear a pile of objects jumble together nearby.|As above, when you can't see the objects.}}
{{message|You feel a jarring vibration nearby.|As above, when you are also [[deaf]].}}
{{message|You hear a faint exhalation.|You picked up a transient object after killing the opponent, and all others vanished.}}

==Trivia==

* If you fled the deathmatch, the <code>#tnntstats</code> [[extended command]] will show 'Deathmatch: Bravely Ran Away'. This is a reference to the song 'Brave Sir Robin Ran Away' from ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail Monty Python and the Holy Grail]''.

==History==

In 2019, the pools of lava in the center of the arena were instead water, and each had two [[giant eels]]. This was changed to make it no longer possible to drown the opponent in the pools by freezing the water and then melting the resulting ice.<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/commit/3daa921efec09f743274436548abc0a324a1a4c6#diff-d44fd1f10753be45c0184db0c0b5c8906f737bdb1f0c522c20f0988f95438f51</ref>

In 2021, there were two fountains in the entrance room, which were removed to stop the same exploit.<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/commit/427c59fa1896d6ed3fb216b6443d6e6ebcf5a731</ref> There was no restriction on entering the deathmatch arena with any unique items. Theoretically, this could make the game [[unwinnable]] if they were left there. Attempting to steal from the deathmatch opponent caused the stolen items to disappear. There was a [[bug]] that caused their entire inventory to be stolen and removed at once this way. The deathmatch opponent was always the most recently ascended character on the system instead of a random one, and it was possible to flee the arena with multiple objects that they threw at you or that you somehow obtained during the fight another way.

A '''swap chest''' is a special [[container]] in [[The November NetHack Tournament]], added in 2018. It is never randomly generated, but there is a guaranteed swap chest in [[Mines' End]] and another in the [[Valley of the Dead]]. It allows players to exchange items between games. You cannot successfully [[wish]] for a swap chest except in [[wizard mode]]; doing so creates a normal [[chest]] instead<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/c5d2fa2f4aee18b58c18c827adbd722c2830dea5/src/objnam.c#L3796</ref>.

In its initial state, you cannot remove objects from a swap chest; however, if the chest is empty, you can reveal that. You can place up to three objects into each swap chest, subject to restrictions (see below). Any object placed into a swap chest will be [[name]]d to include the name of the player who donated it. Once you have placed an object into a swap chest, you can look inside and remove a single object from it. Once you have done so, you can no longer place objects inside<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/c5d2fa2f4aee18b58c18c827adbd722c2830dea5/src/pickup.c#L2658</ref>. Objects inside a swap chest will be fully identified.

Not removing an object from a swap chest constitutes the swap-chestless [[conduct]] in TNNT.

Swap chests cannot be locked<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/cdcb59c1583e6fc7604f93cc59ffd3f6f6b441d3/src/lock.c#L386</ref> or [[Wand of probing|probe]]d<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/af9e0b8d02109c47fc2d20a709e5723fbfe10042/src/zap.c#L1934</ref>. [[Gelatinous cube|Monsters]] cannot eat the swap chest, and will be instantly killed if they attempt it. [[You]], however, can eat an empty swap chest if polymorphed into a [[gelatinous cube]]. Swap chests cannot be picked up by players due to their massive weight, but a tame [[nymph]] can carry it. [[Kick]]ing a swap chest before removing an object from it causes it to deal 10-14 damage to you, ignoring [[half physical damage]]<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/af9e0b8d02109c47fc2d20a709e5723fbfe10042/src/dokick.c#L620</ref>.

Beginning in 2022, various changes have been made to how the swap chest behaves:
* As an object is placed into the swap chest, there is an random equal chance of it staying where it is, or being moved to one of the other two TNNT servers. This will help ensure an even distribution of objects across all three servers.
* Objects placed inside the swap chest cannot be removed by the same player that placed it inside.

==Eligible objects==

The following items can be placed into a swap chest<ref>https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/c5d2fa2f4aee18b58c18c827adbd722c2830dea5/src/pickup.c#L2236</ref>:

* All non-cursed [[ring]]s
* All charged [[wand]]s other than a [[wand of nothing]] or [[wand of wishing]]
* All non-cursed [[amulet]]s other than an [[amulet of strangulation]], [[amulet of restful sleep]] or [[fake Amulet of Yendor]]. The real [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]], of course, cannot be placed into any container.
* All [[Magical item|magical]] [[potion]]s, [[holy water]] and [[unholy water]]
* [[Expensive camera]]s, [[tinning kit]]s and [[magic marker]]s with at least 10 charges
* [[Stethoscope]]s and empty [[oilskin sack]]s
* All chargeable tools with at least one charge
* All other magical [[tool]]s, except non-empty containers and [[unique item]]s
* Non-cursed [[silver saber]]s, [[silver spear]]s, [[silver dagger]]s, or [[Enchantment|+3]] or higher weapons
* All [[dragon scales]], magical [[armor]] other than [[dunce cap]]s, [[fumble boots]] or [[gauntlets of fumbling]], and +3 or higher non-magical armor

* All non-blank scrolls other than a [[scroll of amnesia]] or [[scroll of punishment]]
* [[Royal jelly]], [[wolfsbane]], and [[tin]]s of [[spinach]]

[[Artifact]]s can never be placed into a swap chest.

A '''scroll of missing code''' is a type of scroll in [[The November NetHack Tournament]], added in 2018. It is never randomly generated, but three are randomly placed in the [[Dungeons of Doom]] on different levels. Unlike other objects, they can be generated at any open location on the level, including in corridors or [[shop]]s. They never stack. Reading the scroll has no effect and does not consume it. Scrolls of missing code [[wish]]ed for or left in [[bones]] are changed into [[Scroll of mail|scrolls of mail]], and they cannot be [[magic marker|written]].

Scrolls of missing code are part of the [[DevTeam Office|dev team's quest]], and should be returned to Mike Stephenson in the DevTeam Office.

The '''Really Cool Shirt''' is an [[artifact]] [[T-shirt]] that appears in [[The November NetHack Tournament]], first added in 2018. It is the reward for completing the [[DevTeam Office|dev team's quest]].

It is one of the few guaranteed shirts in [[The November NetHack Tournament]] besides the [[Tourist]]'s starting Hawaiian shirt and the shirt carried by the [[deathmatch]] opponent. It cannot be [[wish]]ed for, and will revert to a normal T-shirt if found in a [[bones]] file.

==Description==
The Really Cool Shirt acts as a [[luckstone]] when carried, and provides [[warning]] while worn. The shirt also has "ever-shifting text": each time you [[read]] it, there is a {{frac|49|50}} chance that it will read a random [[rumor]] according to its [[beatitude]]: true only if blessed, false only if cursed, or either if uncursed.<ref>[https://github.com/tnnt-devteam/tnnt/blob/6bc13a816b89225498353c9eada0aca27b76aa97/src/read.c#L161 TNNT read.c, line 161]</ref>

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|
Little is known about this strange garment. It is said that it comes from outside this dimension, brought here by the strange and unknown beings who created the world. It is inscribed with a large spiral symbol on the back, and the front constantly shimmers with shifting text.

&&%s&& %s Paraelemental {140890 2021-06-14T03:24:38Z {4001463 Actual-nh} Grammar/style '''Paraelementals''' are a group of new elementals in [[dNetHack]] that use the {{white|E}} symbol, but extend past earth, air, fire, and water. Note that the {{mcsl|E}} class in dNetHack also includes [[stalkers]], [[dream quasielemental|dream quasielementals]], and a couple of other monsters. Paraelementals have element-based attacks based on their type, but vary in speed and damage depending on the element.

}}

Lightning paraelementals are likely the most lethal of the elementals to an early-game character. Both the passive and touch attack damage are only halved by shock resistance, not totally negated, and capable of destroying items in your inventory.

Lightning paraelementals can be sung into being by blue half-dragon bards.

}}

Poison paraelementals aren't very threatening to a character with poison resistance, but can seriously injure one without. Poison instadeath has been removed, but the "debilitating" poison that replaces it will severely drain your constitution. Both the passive and touch attack damage are only halved by poison resistance, not totally negated. 

Poison paraelementals can be sung into being by green half-dragon bards.

== Ice paraelemental ==
{{monster
 |name=ice paraelemental
 |symbol={{brightcyan|E}}
 |difficulty=10

}}

Ice paraelementals are slow, but have very damaging attacks. Cold resistance halves the damage taken, but doesn't fully negate it, and it's still capable of destroying inventory items without extrinsic cold resistance. However, cold paraelementals are very slow and normally avoidable if needed.

Ice paraelementals can be sung into being by white half-dragon bards.
