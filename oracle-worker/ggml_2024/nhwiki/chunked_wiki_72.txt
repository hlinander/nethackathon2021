==History==
The piercer has been present in the game since [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]] - [[NetHack 3.0.0]] introduces the three distinct types of piercer.

==Origin==
A piercer is a snail-like gastropod that first appeared in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. It has a shell that resembles a stalactite, and clings to the ceiling of caverns and dungeons, mimicking a stalactite and falling down to impale anything that passes underneath.

The "bestiary of Xygag" mentioned in the encyclopedia entry is an in-universe equivalent to the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' Monster Manual - the excerpt originates in "The Ecology of the Piercer" by Chris Elliott and Richard Edward, published in issue #72 of the ''Dragon'' magazine.

==Messages==
{{message|A <foo> piercer suddenly drops off the ceiling!|A hostile piercer attempted to land on you.}}
{{message|You are almost hit by a falling rock piercer!|The piercer's falling attack missed.}}
{{message|You are hit by a falling rock piercer!|The piercer hit you and inflicted damage.}}
{{message|Its blow glances off your helm.|As above, but you are wearing a metallic helm, reducing the damage to 2.}}

==Variants==
===Lethe patch===
In the [[Lethe Gorge]] within the original [[Lethe patch]], the second level contains an iron piercer along with another random {{white|p}}.

===Convict patch===
In the [[Convict patch]] as well as variants that incorporate the role, the lower filler levels on the [[Convict quest]] contain an assortment of piercers.

===xNetHack===
In [[xNetHack]], piercers have a [[dexterity]]-based percentage chance to miss the player, and a speed-dependent chance to miss a targeted monster. A metallic helm will only halve the damage dealt by a falling piercer hitting you.

===dNetHack===
[[dNetHack]] adds the [[heaven piercer]], which is much faster and stronger than most piercers - although still relatively slow - and can [[stun]] the player with its bite.

The [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Elder Sign|Elder Sign]] is a [[ward]] that can repel piercers, as can the hallucinatory [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Cerulean Sign|Cerulean Sign]].

== Encyclopedia entry ==
{{encyclopedia|Ye Piercer doth look like unto a stalactyte, and hangeth
 from the roofs of caves and caverns.  Unto the height of a
 man, and thicker than a man's thigh do they grow, and in
 groups do they hang.  If a creature doth pass beneath them,
 they will by its heat and noise perceive it, and fall upon
 it to kill and devour it, though in any other way they move
 but exceeding slow.|the Bestiary of Xygag}}

The '''raven''', {{monsym|raven}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It [[flight|flies]] around in an erratic pattern similar to [[bats]], and is the only [[bird]] among the {{monclasslink|B}} [[monster class]]. Ravens have a bite attack and a relatively unique claw attack that can [[blind]] you for d6 (more) turns.

A [[player]] that [[polymorph]]s into a raven will be permanently [[stunned]] while in that form. [[Chat]]ting to a raven will cause it to reply "Nevermore!"{{refsrc|src/sounds.c|680|nethack=3.6.6}}

==Generation==
Randomly-generated ravens are always hostile.

Ravens are among the {{mcsl|B}} that can be randomly generated while within the [[Wizard quest]]. Thirty ravens are generated in the third version of [[Medusa's Island]] on level creation.

==Strategy==
Ravens are quite fast at 20 [[speed]] and can prove annoying to an early character, especially if you lack [[telepathy]] to detect other monsters and move safely around them; being blinded can also prevent you reliably engraving [[Elbereth]] if the situation is dire.

You can protect against a raven's blinding talons by actively blinding yourself using a [[blindfold]] or [[towel]], though you will need telepathy or [[warning]] to follow the raven's erratic movement and additionally avoid attacking peaceful monsters. A pair of [[lenses]] or a [[visored helmet]] can also protect against the attack, though lenses can be hard to find and a visored helmet may not be particularly desirable (e.g., a [[helm of opposite alignment]]). Being polymorphed into an eyeless form will also render you blind and keep you safe.

Beyond blinding you, ravens are not too threatening and can be picked off with most [[ranged attack]]s or a [[pet]] before they get within range.

==History==
The raven first appears in [[NetHack 3.3.0]].

==Origin==
{{wikipedia|Raven}}
{{wikipedia|The Raven}}
A raven is any of several larger-bodied bird species with the genus ''Corvus''. There is no singular taxonomic group within the genus, as well as no common distinction between "crows" and "ravens", which usually are assigned to the different species based on their size. Ravens are omnivorous and have a reputation alongside various other birds for seeking out a wide variety of nutrition sources: carrion, insects, berries, fruit, small animals, and even food waste. The [[wikipedia:common raven|common raven]] (''Corvus corax'') is among the more well known members of the species, and often shows signs of unusual intelligence.

Ravens have enough of a reputation for gouging out the eyes of prey or other animals that it is the subject of at least a few proverbial sayings, up to and including its use as a metaphor in Proverbs 30:17 of The Bible. The raven also has a myriad of symbolisms and other mythic associations due to its black plumage, croaking call and carrion diet - it is both associated with loss and ill omen and considered a symbol of prophecy and insight, as well as a [[wikipedia:psychopomp|psychopomp]] or other similar "mediator" that bridges the worlds of the dead and the living. "The Raven", a narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, is a popular example of many of these aspects and the source of the response given to ''NetHack'' players that chat with one in-game.

==Variants==
In variants that incorporate a [[grudge]] system, ravens will often target eye-based monsters such as the [[floating eye]].

===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], ravens will attack floating eyes and [[evil eye]]s. [[Kick]]ing a [[dead tree]] also has a {{frac|5}} chance to produce a hostile raven.

===FIQHack===
In [[FIQHack]], ravens will also attack floating eyes.

===notdNetHack===
In [[notdNetHack]], ravens are likely to appear within the Dismal Swamp.

===SlashTHEM===
In [[SlashTHEM]], four ravens are generated in the village level of the [[Town]] branch at level creation.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered -- not a feather then he fluttered--
Till I scarcely more than muttered, 'other friends have flown before--
On the morrow *he* will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
        Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'

&&%s&& %s Polypiling {149967 2023-02-15T16:54:23Z {4000114 Derekt75} /* Shuddering */ correct math error In ''[[NetHack]]'', '''polypiling''' is the action of [[polymorph]]ing a pile of [[item]]s in hopes of getting some useful items as a result. Objects polypiled are often referred to as '''polyfodder''' and usually consist of [[junk]]. Polymorph can be caused by a [[Spellbook of polymorph|spell]], [[wand of polymorph|wand]], or [[potion of polymorph|potion]] of polymorph.

Polypiling has its drawbacks: Polyfodder may be destroyed, and hostile [[golem]]s may be generated. The exact mechanics of item destruction are rather complex, but understanding them is important if you want to get the most out of your resources - see [[#Probability of item loss and golem generation|the next section]] for more details.

==Introduction==
When considering polypiling, it is important to distinguish ''stacks'' of items, which are all of one type (e.g., "4 [[blessed]] [[scroll of blank paper|scrolls of blank paper]]"), from ''piles'' of items, which are all of the items on the floor in one [[square]]. The terms ''stack'' and ''pile'' will be used rigorously on this page.

The spell and wand supply a beam with a random range between 6 and 13 (long enough to hit 3 to 7 piles if they are all in line and contiguous and you are adjacent to the first) so you can work on several piles at once. A [[potion of polymorph]] works on one item stack at a time, the item stack you dip into it.

Polymorphed items do not change item class: Potions will always yield potions, scrolls will yield scrolls, armor will always yield armor, etc. - the exception to this is polymorphing a [[crocodile]] [[corpse]], which will yield a pair of non-[[cursed]] [[fireproof]] +0 [[low boots]] instead of another [[comestible]]. [[Stackable]] [[weapons]] and [[tools]] can "merge" into non-stackable ones (e.g. a stack of 4 daggers morphing into a single long sword); other stackable objects are not subject to this.{{refsrc|zap.c|1234}}{{refsrc|zap.c|1312}}{{refsrc|objclass.h|15}} [[Unicorn horn]]s are especially popular polyfodder because they may polymorph into other [[magical tool]]s, such as [[magic marker]]s. Another useful thing to do if you gain polymorph in the early game is to polypile [[spellbook]]s. Polymorphing retains the [[charge]]s and [[enchantment]] of polymorphed items.

When polymorphing [[wand]]s and spellbooks, their quality degrades. A spellbook will act as if it had been [[read]] once more. If the book's combined read/polymorph-count is four or more, it will turn into a blank spellbook counted as read 0&ndash;3 times;{{refsrc|zap.c|1552|nethack=3.6.1}} it will thus subsequently be able to be polymorphed into a non-blank spellbook with 75% chance.

Likewise, a wand may count as if it had been [[charging#wands|recharged]], increasing the chance of an explosion if you attempt to recharge it; thus, it is not generally worthwhile to polypile empty wands, even if they become something worth charging, the chances of the new wand exploding instead of [[charging]] are already higher than normal. The chance of a wand's charge counter being incremented by polymorphing it is {{sfrac|6 &minus; <var>x</var>|7}} where <var>x</var> is the number of times the wand has been recharged.{{refsrc|zap.c|1333|comment=recharge count < rn2(7)  to see if polymorph increments charge counter on wands}}

The recharge count of [[tool]]s is not affected by polymorphing them, unless the tool becomes a [[magic marker]], in which case its charge counter will be set to 1.

Polypiling items that belong to a [[shopkeeper]] can anger the shopkeeper.

==Probability of item loss and golem generation==
The polymorph [[beam]] generated by the wand and spell acts on each pile separately.{{refsrc|zap.c|2744|comment=bhit calls bhitpile for each square/pile}} 

First, each item stack in the pile has a chance of resisting, which is 5% for normal items and 95% for artifacts; [[unique item]]s cannot shudder, polymorph, or be absorbed by forming golems.

{{todo|List which materials can produce specific golems.}}

===Shuddering===

Then, each item stack that did not resist has a chance of "shuddering" (i.e., undergoing a [[system shock]]).{{refsrc|zap.c|1733|comment=bhitpile goes through each stack separately, calling bhito--to which a function pointer has been passed in as fhito--to perform the actual polymorph}}{{refsrc|zap.c|1515|comment=bhito calls obj_shudders on just one object, and obj_shudders does not inspect other items on the square, i.e. in the pile}}

The probability of an item stack undergoing [[system shock]] depends on its [[BUC status]], unless it is a [[wand]], and its size, as follows:<ref>{{function|zap.c|obj_shudders}} (obj_shudders determines whether a given stack will shudder.)</ref>

* For stacks of less than 5 items:
** Blessed non-wand: {{frac|12}}
** Uncursed non-wand: {{frac|8}}
** Wand of any BUC or stack of any cursed items: {{frac|3}}

* For stacks of 5 items or more: <!-- obj_shudders treats wands and cursed items identically, but since wands don't stack, they're not mentioned here -->
** Blessed: {{frac|6}}
** Uncursed: {{frac|4}}
** Cursed: 1

When a stack shudders, it loses 1d(items in stack &minus; 1) items, except in the case of single items, which are always destroyed.

For each item stack in the pile that undergoes a system shock, there is a chance of a [[golem]] being created. For each item in a shuddering stack (counting those items destroyed by the shock itself) there is a {{sfrac|[[luck]] + 45}} probability of creating a [[golem]].{{refsrc|zap.c|1162|comment=do_osshock decides whether or not it should make a golem}} A {{sfrac|[[luck]] + 45}} chance for each item means the chance that a stack generates a golem is approximately {{sfrac|<var>s</var>|[[luck]] + 45}} for small <var>s</var>. No more than one golem can be created per pile.{{refsrc|zap.c|1160|comment=poly_zapped is a file level static variable, visible to every function in zap.c, −1 means no golem created yet, else it contains the material of the item whose shuddering resulted in golem creation. do_osshock checks that its −1 before trying to make a golem.}} However, even after NetHack has decided to create a golem, additional stacks in the pile can shudder. 

If an item stack shuddered, even if some of the items that were in the stack remain, it will ''not'' be polymorphed. The rest of the stacks in the pile still have a chance of being polymorphed.{{refsrc|zap.c|1519|comment=if the obj shuddered, bhito exits WITHOUT polymorphing the object.}}<ref>{{function|mkobj.c|splitobj}} (If any items remained after the shuddering occurred, they will have been reinserted in the item tracking linked list, but they will have been inserted before the deleted ones, and bhitpile will not return to them.)</ref>{{refsrc|zap.c|1735|comment=bhitpile decides the next object before bhito has a chance to call do_osshock and destroy/split item stacks.}}{{refsrc|zap.c|1521|comment=poly_obj is called AFTER do_osshock has finished with the stack.}}

For any stack that did not shudder, the polymorph process continues. There is a (number of items in stack/1000) probability that the entire stack merges into a single item.{{refsrc|zap.c|1312|comment=poly_obj decides whether or not to merge the items in the stack}}

Additionally, when attempting to polypile [[rock]]s or [[gray stone]]s into [[gem]]s or [[worthless glass]], an 1d4 is rolled against stack size; if the stack is larger, transmutation "backfires", destroying half of the stack and turning the rest into rocks unconditionally.{{refsrc|zap.c|1561|nethack=3.6.1}}

The actual polymorph is now performed. See [[polypile#Probability_of_item_transformation|the next section]] for exactly what your item stack will be turning into.

This process is repeated for each item stack in the pile.

=== Golem absorption and types ===
If a golem is created from any stack in a pile, it can "absorb" additional item stacks in the pile, destroying them. The material destroyed by the golem is separate from that destroyed by the original system shock(s). If, after every stack has been polymorphed, zero or one item remains in the pile (due perhaps to bad system shocks), golem creation is aborted, if it had been planned at all. According to a comment in the source: "no golems if you zap only one object – not enough stuff".{{refsrc|zap.c|1076|comment=golem creation aborted for not enough items}} (This comment is slightly inaccurate; it's possible to zap several items, reach this point in the code, and have the material check fail because all or all but one of the items were destroyed by system shocks.)

The golem will attempt to absorb a number of individual items (not item stacks, "4 scrolls" counts for 4, not 1), equal to its weight.{{refsrc|zap.c|1140|comment=mons[pm_index] is a permonst structure, defined in permonst.h, the cwt field is the weight of the monsters corpse, which is defined for golems even though they leave no corpses.}}{{refsrc|zap.c|1035|comment=polyuse doesn't stop absorbing items until minwt is 0, minwt is initialized to golem corpse weight}}{{refsrc|zap.c|1054|comment=not that polyuse is subtracting the QUANTITY of objects from minwt, not the WEIGHT of those objects. iron golems will absorb up to 2000 iron items}} Only items that are made of the same [[material]] as the item stack whose shuddering cause the golem to form are eligible for absorption. For instance, if a mithril-coat shudders and results in an iron golem, that iron golem will absorb other mithril items on the pile, but leave iron items untouched. Each eligible item stack has a 1 in (golem weight + 1) chance of escaping absorption. Given the high weights of golems, 400 for straw and paper up to 2000 for iron, it is highly unlikely that any eligible item will survive this process. Also, this absorption occurs after the items have been polymorphed. If a mithril item shudders and creates an iron golem, and several other mithril objects on the pile are polymorphed into other materials, e.g. leather coats or iron helmets, they will ''not'' be absorbed, though any leather coats or iron helmets polymorphed into mithril items ''will'' be absorbed.{{refsrc|zap.c|1043|comment=which items are eligible for absorption; note that "mat" is the material of the shuddered item stack NOT of the golem created}}

Each stack in a pile is polymorphed separately, in order of the most recently dropped, and the type of golem is determined by the material of the first item stack to shudder and result in golem creation.{{refsrc|zap.c|1160|comment=once NetHack decides to create a golem it records the shuddering stack's material and stops trying to create golems for additional stacks.}}{{refsrc|zap.c|1733|comment=bhitpile goes through objects forwards through the list}}{{refsrc|mkobj.c|1115|comment=place_object adds dropped objects to the front of the list, where bhitpile will encounter them first.}} This is exploitable; see {{sa|One large pile|sectionsign=1}} for details.

===Artifacts===

[[Artifact]]s have a 95% chance of resisting. (Compare to 5% for normal items.) If this 95% chance fails, they are polymorphed just like every other item, first undergoing a shuddering check and then, if they aren't destroyed, undergoing a polymorph to a random non-artifact weapon. Artifacts have ''no'' resistance to being absorbed by a forming golem. Excalibur may be mostly safe from shuddering or polymorphing atop that pile of iron junk, but if an iron golem forms it is virtually guaranteed that Excalibur will be destroyed.{{refsrc|zap.c|1038|comment=resistance check only serves to protect the invocation items and the amulet}}

===Summary of polyfodderdestruction ===

This process, from the resistance check to here, is repeated for each pile hit by the beam.

In other words, there are 3 ways polyfodder can be destroyed:
* Shuddering, the probability of which is decreased by blessing, polymorphing items other than wands, and keep the size of individual stacks under 4.
* Merging, the probability of which is reduced by lowering the size of individual stacks.
* Stackable weapons and tools merging into non-stackables (separate from the n/1000 chance outlined above), which is mitigated by lowering stack size of weapons and tools.
* Absorption into forming golems, the probability of which is reduced by:
** Increasing your luck, reducing the chance of golem formation.
** Reducing the size of the individual item stacks, reducing the chance of golem formation.
** Reducing the number of item stacks on the pile, reducing the number of opportunities for golems to form.
** Limiting the number of items on the pile that are made of the same material, reducing the number of items a forming golem can absorb.
*** In particular, the items on the top of the pile, the ones you drop last, should be a different material than the most valuable items in the pile. Potential golems will likely be made out of the material of the top items, not the material of the valuable items. Thus the valuable items will survive while the cheaper ones are destroyed. See {{sa|One large pile|sectionsign=1}} for details.

== Probability of item transformation ==
When polymorphing a [[magical object]], the game will try to change it into another random magical object, retrying up to two times if the replacement would be non-magical.{{refsrc|zap.c|1215}} The third item generated will be used, regardless if it is magical. The reverse is true when polymorphing a non-magical object. The upshot is that a magical object has a significantly higher probability than a non-magical object of turning into another magical object. So don't expect many magic markers from polypiling pick-axes and mirrors; you will have much better odds polypiling unicorn horns. The exceptions are potions of water, blank scrolls, blank spellbooks, and wands of nothing, all of which have a high chance of becoming more-useful items of the same type. As mentioned above, blessed items have only a 1/12 chance of undergoing system shock, so blessing your polypile items is definitely worth the expenditure if you have a surplus of holy water.

* [[Rider]] corpses
* [[wand of polymorph]]
* [[potion of polymorph]]
* [[spellbook of polymorph]]

==Strategy==
Polypiling is often used to get [[ascension kit]] [[armor]] (and completed by [[wish]]ing). Therefore, you might want to collect all those [[elven cloak]]s and [[elven boots|boots]] in the game.

Polypiling is most often used by [[conduct]] players who need certain items: It can substitute for wishing, [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] benefits, or [[illiterate|literacy]], and it can be done relatively safely. Generated monsters offer an almost unlimited supply of polyfodder. However, polypiling is time-consuming and tedious. Generally, it is not worth it unless you are trying for conducts, or unless you are looking for many items at once.

Over-preparing is the other common reason for polypiling. This goes for many first ascenders, [[pacifist]] characters who want the most [[protection]], or even an attempt to get a very high score by polypiling rocks into gems.

===General tips===
* Never handle both polyfodder and items you want to keep in your main inventory at the same time, and never ever drop anything useful on your polypile line. People have wondered where their [[bag of holding]] with all the artifacts went.
* Even if you do not care about polyfodder loss, #name rocks to get stacks of at most four. There is a limit to how many gems can be created.
* Max out your [[luck]] to minimize golem creation. That reduces the total material lost. This is particular useful for larger stacks and piles, where any golem will do comparatively more damage. Do not max your luck if using the [[#One large pile|one large pile strategy below]].
* Configure [[autopickup exception]]s to pick up good morphs and your want-to-keeps from the pile.
* Polypile your items near a [[general store]] to help identify good morphs. Be ''very'' careful of polypiling in a store; if any of the shopkeeper's items are polymorphed, they will become angry and attack you without giving you a chance to pay.
* Familiarize yourself with the ways polyfodder is lost to determine how much risk to take on, given your available polyfodder and the amount of polypile sources you have available to you. Your patience is also a factor, perfect optimization is time consuming and tedious.

===Preparing===
* To minimize loss, it is a good idea to mass-[[bless]] magical polyfodder, which is much less abundant than ordinary junk. [[Potion]]s and [[scroll]]s can be [[cancel]]ed so they will [[stack]], and then dipped in {{! of|holy water}}. Name and separate them into stacks of at most four items before polymorphing. Only armor and weapons (and wands) retain their enchantment; these should be canceled if negative before blessing. A large stack of [[dart]]s can be enchanted to +7 in one go and then polypiled individually for potentially powerful weapons. Magical armor and tools tend to become non-magical rather than shuddering, so there is no point blessing them.
** Non-stackables, such as [[ring]]s, require more work to bless. Often, it is not worth the costs. The most efficient way is with a blessed, confused [[scroll of remove curse]]. In a safe location, pick up as much polyfodder as possible but carry no other uncursed items. Then confuse yourself, read a blessed scroll of remove curse, end confusion, and mass-uncurse cursed items with the {{+ of|remove curse}} spell at a skilled level. The light blue aura boon when carefully [[pray]]ing on an altar or even another scroll can also uncurse your entire main inventory. This procedure yields 12.5 blessings per scroll on average.
* Unless you will need only one read, name [[spellbook]]s individually how often you have read them, and sort them accordingly. Under each pile you intend to polymorph, engrave that number. Any nameless books after the polymorph will count as read one more time. Keep in mind how often you will have to re-read the spells you get.
* Sort polyfodder by [[BUC]] status so you won't have to re-test after polypiling.

===When to polypile===
* If a game has been unforgiving, a good time to consider polypiling is when there are many things needed at once; the odds of getting ''at least one'' of them is improved. For example, if you're looking for a [[magic marker]] in particular, getting a [[tinning kit]] would be seen as a waste. However, if you were looking for both a magic marker ''and'' a tinning kit, the effective odds of getting something you want go up. If you're looking for a [[horn of plenty]], a magic marker, a [[pair of lenses]], and a tinning kit all at once, polypiling unicorn horns begins to look increasingly attractive.
* '''[[Potion]]s''' are attractive to polymorph, due to the ease of creating fruit juice and water, and mass blessing them. Furthermore, with the help of [[alchemy]], a good third of the available potions are useful in some way. While you may not get the potion of enlightenment, or gain level, that you wanted, you are likely to end with various healing potions, levitation, etc, that can be quickly used to work towards what you really want.
* '''[[Scroll]]s''' are commonly polymorphed for similar reasons. Here, part of the motivation is in doing away with magic markers. It adds a great deal of randomness to the mix, but scrolls are still cheaper than marker charges.
* '''[[Magical tool]]s''', especially [[unicorn horn]]s, are a common fodder due to the large number of useful magical tools and the abundance of unicorn horns. (Revived unicorns have a 50% chance of leaving another horn.) Certainly, the magic marker is generally what most would go for, but in the attempt you might find other goodies. A [[horn of plenty]], for instance, spawns potions you can polypile; a [[fire horn|fire]] or [[frost horn|frost]] horn may also be of help, as may a [[magic harp]] or [[magic flute]]. This is especially helpful to Tourists or other neutral players with the [[PYEC]].
* '''[[Magical armor]]''' can help finish off an [[ascension kit]], most often using the various abundant [[elven]] equipment as fodder. This is mostly only useful to ([[wishless]]) conduct players, as the [[castle]]'s guaranteed five wishes are good enough to get all the missing types of armor; furthermore, its armor stores might contain missing pieces.
** A common trick is to polymorph elven armor, which can safely be enchanted to +7, into a +7 [[T-shirt]]. The number of +7 armors isn't terribly prohibitive: the blessed [[scroll of enchant armor]] (to get to +7) will also bless the armor and reduce the odds of shuddering.

* '''[[Ring]]s''' can help finish off an [[ascension kit]], particularly with rings of {{= of|levitation|slow digestion|or=1|free action}}, if you're unlucky and haven't found them before [[Medusa's Island]]. Most other rings are only useful in specific situations, polypiling or not.
** One cheesy trick is to polypile for rings of {{= of|protection|or=1|increase damage}}, with the intention of [[eating jewelry|eating]] them. It's possible to get a ridiculously low [[AC]] <!-- AC does not overflow below −127--> or ridiculously high damage. The former is pointless, other than to sound impressive, because you can reasonably get to &minus;40AC without such mind-numbing busywork, and that is enough to make even a [[minotaur]] barely scrape the polish on your armor. The latter may be for [[Death farming]] to a ludicrously high score.
* '''[[Spellbook]]s''', if you are happy with any random book and accept you cannot re-read it. Early in the game, when you don't know many spells yet, you can get dozens of new ones out of a few spellbooks.  In [[3.6.0]] the bug allowing to always learn new spells from overpolymorphed spellbooks has been fixed; a non-blank polymorphed spellbook will be counted as read 1&ndash;3 times, and you can only learn a new spell from it if this number is lower than 3. Otherwise, it will turn blank on reading. Thus, it is advised to formally [[identify]] unknown polymorphed spellbooks before reading, so you could overwrite them with a [[magic marker]] in the latter case.  Newbies might carry books and rings along (unencumbered) into a [[Minetown]] shop in the early game and polymorph there.
* '''Junk armor''': Shirts are annoyingly rare in the main dungeon, but other armors are not. Zapping a wand of polymorph at that 15 pages pile of items in [[Fort Ludios]] is probably the easiest way to get a shirt outside of bones, wishing, or playing a Tourist.
* '''When''' can also be considered "in the temporal sense". By the time you reach [[Vlad's Tower]], you can take a little break, lock the door and begin the process in peace and quiet, after having accumulated a backbreaking load of loot. One nice benefit is that you can also use that location to summon wraiths that will leave a corpse to eat, unlike the rest of [[Gehennom]], should your efforts yield [[magic marker]]s for writing {{? of|genocide}} on any cursed blank scrolls (for generating the last, note the guaranteed [[water walking boots]] there).

===When not to polypile===
* '''[[Wand]]s''' are ''generally'' not worth it. This is mostly because by the usual time the player has a serious stash of wands, and abundant means to polymorph objects (read: the spell), there is only one wand seriously worth going after: {{wand of|death}}. But this late into the game, there are only four monsters that it matters on—[[Pestilence]], [[Famine]], the [[Wizard of Yendor]], and the [[high priest of Moloch]]. Likely (but not ''necessarily''), you already have enough wands of death to deal with those enemies. Also, polymorphed wands will more likely explode if charged again.
** In the midgame, however, it may be worth it. If the player doesn't quite have enough items to make a full polypile line, a square of scrap wands may not make anything that you need, but it ''might'' make a wand you've yet to identify (if it has charges left). It may also be that you need a wand's special properties—for example, a [[wand of fire]]'s ability to engrave a permanent [[Elbereth]] square.
* '''Specific [[spellbook]]s''': If you only need one specific spellbook (or a [[spellbook of polymorph]] to start with), there are better methods than polypiling. Wizards with sufficient [[luck]] can write one using a [[magic marker]]. Anyone willing to do the [[altar]] work can get books from their god, especially the last few ones you do not yet know.
* There are better ways to get various other items. For example, a [[trident]], while normally quite rare, can be found in the [[death drop]] of a salamander or a [[horned devil]]. A silver saber, very desirable for [[twoweapon]] combat, can be found in the inventory of the Minetown watch, or the various captains that show up in the [[Castle]].
* Items not generated randomly aren't available from polypiling, e.g. [[athame]]s.

==Stacking strategies==

===Seven small piles===

====Step by step====
* Maximize your [[luck]]. (+13 is best.)
* Collect your items. See the section above to decide what to polypile.
* Individually name stackables to separate them into stacks of two (preferable), three, or four. Try to avoid single items, except for weapons and tools, which should be completely unstacked.
* Distribute the item stacks over seven small piles in a straight line, each pile containing a good mix of different types of material. Put the items you want polymorphed most at the front of the line. (First three piles are guaranteed, each of the four piles after that is progressively less likely.)
* Zap polymorph.
* Review results. [[Autopickup]] with [[Autopickup exceptions|exceptions]] can automate this for you.
* Repeat.

====Explanation====
Separating your stackables minimizes the chances of merging and shuddering. Weapons and tools will eventually turn into something unstackable, and you lose all but one. For other items, stacks of one are less desirable, since shuddering destroys them completely, while larger stacks only lose half of the stack on average.

Maximizing your luck minimizes the chances of golems forming.

Distributing your item stacks over 7 squares minimizes the damage a forming golem can do, because a golem can only absorb items from the square it forms on. 

Ensuring a good mix of different materials also minimizes the damage a forming golem can do, because the golem can only absorb items that are made of the same material as the shuddered item that led to its formation.

===One large pile===
====Step by step====
* Minimize your luck. (0 is good; &minus;13 is better!)
* Collect your items. See the section above to decide what to polypile, but avoid items made of [[mineral]] (e.g. some rings, wands). The number of [[wand]]s and [[ring]]s destroyed by this method will be slightly greater than the number destroyed by the seven small piles method. If you want to polypile mineral-based items, do ''not'' use this method.
* Individually name stackables to separate them, especially weapons and tools. Separating them all the way into stacks of just one single item is best, but just getting them into stacks of four or fewer is almost as good.
* Put every item stack in one large pile.
* Obtain a very large number of rocks.
* Curse the rocks.
* Individually name the rocks to break them into small stacks. Five rocks per stack is best, get as close to that as your patience allows. Do not make stacks smaller than five.
* Drop all the rocks on top of the item pile. Make sure you drop the rocks ''after'' the items so they are on top!
* Zap polymorph.
* Kill the stone golem.
* Review results.
* Repeat.

You ''want'' a stone golem to form from those rocks, because it will prevent other types of golems from forming and damaging your valuable polyfodder. Assuming cursed rocks in stacks of 5, and [[Luck]] of 10: 50 rocks is approximately a 58% chance of a stone golem, 200 rocks is approximately a 97% chance of a stone golem, and 300 rocks is approximately a 99.5% chance of a stone golem.

A [[rubber chicken]] and a [[pick-axe]] are quite helpful here, in order to create a large number of rocks near the fodder pile.

====Explanation====
This method exploits the specifics of the polypiling algorithm.

Separating your stackables minimizes the chances of merging and shuddering. The only threat to deal with now is golem absorption.

Ordinarily putting every item stack on one pile would be a terrible idea, because any forming golem would have access to every item you were polypiling. However, in this strategy we ensure that the golem won't be able to absorb anything useful, by manipulating the material it is made of. A golem can only absorb items made of the same material it is. An iron golem generated from shuddering mithril can only absorb other mithril items. A wood golem generated from shuddering wood can only absorb other wood items. And&mdash;most importantly in this case&mdash;a stone golem generated from a shuddering mineral item can only absorb other mineral items.

Only one golem can be generated from a pile, and the first item stack to shudder and lead to golem formation gets to decide the material. By putting the rocks on top we ensure that they get processed first.

Cursing the rocks increases the chances that they will shudder.

Keeping the rocks in stacks of more than 4 (5 in this case) also increases this chance.

Minimizing our luck increases the chances that our rocks will give rise to a golem once they shudder.

The probability of an individual stack ''not'' giving rise to a golem, ''if'' it shudders, is (<small>{{sfrac|luck + 44|luck + 45}}</small>)<sup><var>s</var></sup>, where <var>s</var> is the stack size. The probability of the stack shuddering (and not resisting initial polymorph) is 95% for stacks of 5 or more cursed items; this is the highest chance we can get. Thus the probability of a stack ''not'' forming a golem is 0.05 + 0.95 × (<small>{{sfrac|luck + 44|luck + 45}}</small>)<sup><var>s</var></sup>. If every stack of rocks in a pile is identical (all contain 5 cursed rocks), then the chance of none of them giving rise to a golem is (0.05 + 0.95 × (<small>{{sfrac|luck + 44|luck + 45}}</small>)<sup><var>s</var></sup>)<sup><var>n</var></sup>, where <var>n</var> is the number of stacks. Thus we want our stacks to be as small as possible, so that we can have as many as possible, ''without'' having fewer than 5 rocks per stack.

For the most part, there are no items made from mineral you might be interested in polypiling for. The exceptions are marble wands and granite, opal, clay, coral, moonstone and black onyx rings. The material an item is made of can change when it is polymorphed, and it is the final material that matters for golem absorption. Since any polymorphed wand or ring could end up being one of the mineral ones, the effect is that this technique will consume slighty more wands and rings than the other technique, and that the specific item types that are made of mineral cannot be polypiled for (with this method).

There is a 5% chance of a normal item resisting polymorph and reaching this point unchanged, so the initial material matters somewhat as well. For instance if you try to polypile a figurine and it resists, it is almost guaranteed to be absorbed (because figurines are mineral).

Beware! In the unlikely event that a stone golem does ''not'' form from the rocks: then, given the large pile underneath, there is a good chance a golem ''will'' form from another material, possibly doing a lot of damage. With enough cursed rocks, less material is lost on average with the one-pile than with the multi-pile technique.

====One large pile with meatballs====

If you know [[stone to flesh]] spell, you should cast it at your rocks to turn them into [[meatball]]s, then use them instead of rocks in the advice above. In this case, you can polypile for mineral items, but can't polypile for [[egg]]s and [[tripe ration]]s. The golem rising from the pile will be a [[flesh golem]] instead of a [[stone golem]].

== SLASH'EM ==

In SLASH'EM, polymorphed items revert back to their original form after 500&ndash;999 turns.{{refsrc|timeout.c|455|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} Items that will eventually revert are described as "hazy" in [[wizard mode]]. Hazy items can be "fixed" by dipping them in a [[potion of restore ability]].

There are some exceptions to this:
* Items that were initially eggs laid by the player{{refsrc|zap.c|1443|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} or corpses{{refsrc|zap.c|1489|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} do not revert.
* If a [[magic lamp]] is randomly chosen at first, the [[oil lamp]] with which it is replaced does not revert.{{refsrc|zap.c|1518|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}
* Items that become [[land mine]]s or [[beartrap]]s do not revert.{{refsrc|zap.c|1526|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}
* Items that become the same object type as they were before do not revert, even if they otherwise changed (such as a diluted potion of sickness becoming an undiluted potion of sickness).{{refsrc|timeout.c|453|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

The reversion is done not by restoring the original item but by changing the item to the original item's type,{{refsrc|timeout.c|480|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}} which has some consequences that may not be expected, including the following:
* Some properties, such as [[beatitude]] and [[erosion]], are carried over from the transformed item rather than the original.
* Some other properties, such as being an [[artifact]], are lost.
* A stack of multiple items that became a single item reverts to a single item of the original type.
* An item that became an [[amulet of unchanging]] does not revert.{{refsrc|zap.c|1374|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F2}}

The transmutation limits the usefulness of polypiling somewhat, as obtaining permanent items requires a commensurate supply of potions. However, polypiling is still just as useful to obtain items that can be useful right away or relatively soon; for example, a polypiled [[magic marker]] can be immediately used to write a few scrolls, and then allowed to transmute back after it is empty.

In some cases, the reversion can be useful:
* When polypiling magical items, if they turn into non-magical items, one can simply wait for them to revert, and try again.
* [[Boulder]]s can be polymorphed into statues and transported more easily, and will turn back into boulders.
* Any armor can be safely enchanted to +7 by polymorphing it into [[elven armor]].
** If you have a [[wand of polymorph]] and two or three [[potion of gain level|potions of gain level]], you can easily get a +7 [[helm of brilliance]] by polypiling ubiquitous orcish and dwarven helmets until you get an elven item (or something that can be [[upgrade]]d into one), enchanting, and upgrading the enchanted helmet after it reverts.
* Some further consequences are probably bugs:
** After polymorphing a boulder into a statue, breaking it will result in a number of rocks; if they are separated, each separate stack reverts to a boulder.
** Weapons can be polymorphed into [[dwarvish mattock]]s, [[upgrade]]d to [[pick-axe]]s, and polymorphed further into other tools, particularly charged ones; when they revert, the weapon's enchantment will be the tool's number of charges, which can be much higher than normally feasible.

== Code ==
{{function|zap.c|bhito}} is the root of item polymorphs from the spell and wand. It is called for each stack of items a polymorph zap hits by [[zap.c#bhitpile|bhitpile]]. First it refuses to polymorph polymorph-sources, and allows items to resist.{{refsrc|zap.c|1503|comment=bhito does a resistance check for each item}} It calls [[Zap.c#obj_shudders|obj_shudders]] to check for system shocks{{refsrc|zap.c|1515|comment=bhito checks for system shocks}} and calls [[Zap.c#do_osshock|do_osshock]] to perform them.{{refsrc|zap.c|1518|comment=bhito performs a system shock}} Finally bhito calls [[zap.c#polyobj|polyobj]] to actually transform the stack.{{refsrc|zap.c|1521|comment=bhito calls polyobj}}

[[Zap.c#do_osshock|do_osshock]] determines whether or not to generate a [[golem]], and after all the stacks in the pile have been polymorphed by repeated calls to bhito, bhitpile calls [[zap.c#create_polymon|create_polymon]] to actually generate thegolem.

If create_polymon is called, it possibly creates the golem and then, if the golem was created, in turn calls [[zap.c#polyuse|polyuse]] to consume additional polyfodder.{{refsrc|zap.c|1140|comment=create_polymon calls polyuse}}

== How to write a great article ==

There are many many aspects to cover in NetHackWiki. At the ground level we have the items and monsters in the game. Each article about these should have the following sections: Facts, Commentary, and Strategy. Firstly, we list the facts about the relevant item. Then in Commentary, we draw attention to the implications of these facts. Finally in Strategy, we give useful advice on how to use with or deal with this thing!

== Images from the Windows version? ==

Anyone know if there's any copyright on images from the Windows tile version? If not, it might be a good idea to upload them to the articles. [[User:Lotte|Lotte]] 20:31, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

: The tile files are from the [[vanilla]] 3.4.3 sources. Because they are part of vanilla NetHack, they should be copyrighted but licensed under the [[NetHackWiki:NetHack General Public License|NetHack General Public License]] <tt>dat/license</tt>, which should make them okay to upload here.

: [[Image:Vanilla tiles.png|thumb|right|These are the tiles after conversion to PNG.]] The tiles live in <tt>win/share</tt>, but during the build, [[X11]] and [[Qt]] builds convert the tiles to ''.xpm'' format and put them <tt>dat/x11tiles</tt>. ([[Windows]] builds apparently use ''.bmp'' files.) So I told the image view [[Wikipedia:KView|KView]] to convert the file from ''.xpm'' to ''.png'' format, and uploaded that here.

'''re: [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] - Chopping Tiles into small files'''

What I plan on doing is chopping both the 16x16 (vanilla) tiles and the 32x32 tiles into a series of images with names that can be referenced using row, col index. For example the very first tile (ant) is in row 01 and col 01. Its name would be <prefix><row>-<col> ie: img01-01. The 7th tile across is an acid blob img01-07, soldier img08-01, etc. 

Please tell me if this what you want (good idea/bad idea)? 

If yes, then ideas/suggestions on image format. I see two options for image format. 
# The x16 and x32 tiles in their own files
* Pro
** Allows for lot more control when using in page layout.
** x16 and x32 tiles can be used seperatly. For instance, the x32 tiles on the monsters list page, and both tiles in the page about a specific monster.
* Con
** A lot of small files ~ 2400. (note: many images are duplicates and estimate includes blank, wall, and effect tiles)
# The x16 and x32 tiles merged into one image, ie: [[Image:ch-01-01.png]].
* Pro
** Fewer files ~ 1200, less files to edit if anyone wants to change border, background, etc.
* Con
** Merged image looks slightly tacky.

ideas/suggestions on naming. I am going to call the images (16t<r>-<c>.png, 32t<r>-<c>.png) or img<r>-<c>.png depending on image format.

ideas/suggestions on cataloguing. I am planning on making a page with a row, col style grid table displaying all images along with name.

ideas on how to bulk upload.

-- [[User:PraetorFenix|PraetorFenix]] 00:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

:I think we only need the larger versions. They can be reduced, but enlarging small images is problematic. Also, naming the images just by coordinates is, in my opinion, not a good idea. It becomes hard to find the correct image if they ever need to be changed or something. It would be better if the images were properly named, such as ''soldierant.png'' or ''hellhoundpup.png''. I understand it would be easy to create a script to chop the large file and name the files by the coordinates, but still. Many images are also messy (at least to my eye that is used to the ASCII graphics) and you just cannot recognize what is in it. The row-col -scheme wouldn't help in that case. --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 23:10, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

::The problem is that the larger tiles consist of entirely different images. They are not larger versions of the x16 tiles. [[Image:Tiles32.png|thumb|right|x32 tiles after conversion to PNG]] I've uploaded the x32 tiles for reference. I understand your point about naming. In keeping with Lotte's effort I think we should stick with the x16 vanilla tiles. After all they are the standard that ships w/ NetHack.

This shouldn't be too difficult to do. --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 19:40, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

:::::::I now made the letters larger as I finally found that they were unreadable. No one plays NetHack with that tiny font anyway. It was also hard to see the characters in the dark background when they were small and had no padding around them. I also changed the font to monospaced. The only downside is that making the letters large with <nowiki><span style="font-size: 350%;">[template here]</span></nowiki> doesn't work anymore. Do we need it? --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 23:11, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

::::I like the idea of showing the ASCII chars that represent game objects. Unfortunately it turns out that the same object is represented by different chars on different systems, see [[Talk:Fountain]]. In addition not all characters can be represented in html, and the colors won't render on a browser that overrides display defaults. 

::::I suggest we decide on a standard set of characters for the game objects and then display them using embedded images Like so... [[Image:ch-01-01.png]]

::::-- [[User:PraetorFenix|PraetorFenix]] 23:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

:::::I mentioned on [[Talk:Fountain]] that we should use the ASCII default characters by default, with a brief mention of alternatives used. Granted, HTML is not perfect, but realistically 99% of browsers respect stylesheets, and people who override them expect to lose colouring info anyway. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 21:04, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

== A model article ==

I've made an extensive article about the [[potion of object detection]]. Any suggestions or improvements? I think we should make a model article for each "type" of object or monster, and I think this one is pretty much what we want it to look like. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 16:47, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

:I'd like to get rid of the "spoiler-look" (''xyz-343.txt'') in all articles and replace those parts with running prose text. Otherwise this wiki becomes just a YASMS (Yet Another Spoiler Mirror Site, an acronym I just made up). Also listing the symbol and weight for each potion is rather needless, because they are the same for each one. After all, there is a general article about [[potion]]s and another on [[weight]]. --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 19:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, needs more prose. I'd actually prefer depending as little as possible on already public spoilers - after all, they all come from the same source: the source code. [[User:Lotte|Lotte]] 21:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
----
::I rearranged the table to put the symbol at the top. I envisage a similar table for ''every'' item in the game, and weight is a standard property of every item, so in the interest of consistency between item articles, I think both symbol and weight deserve a place.

::I too am keen to develop a wiki-look instead of falling back on the Hugo spoilers, but as it stands the xxxx-343.txt text is brilliantly designed; it's clear, concise and comprehensive. I am struggling to create anything better, but I would welcome any attempt to do so. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 21:16, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

:::It bothers me that some of those files are divided into two, like wan1-343.txt and wan2-343.txt. The information can be presented in one wikipage nicely. Listing all possible given messages (''"You sense the presence of objects."  (not hallucinating); "You sense the presence of something."  (hallucinating); "You sense the absence of objects."  (not hallucinating); "You sense the absence of something."  (hallucinating)'') also seems unnecessary. Who identifies stuff while confused, anyway? If someone really needs all those messages, they can go check the spoiler. Then there are lists like
  hits monster
     No effect.
   vapors
     No effect.
:::which could be replaced by a single sentence "The potion has no effect when it vapors or hits a monster."
:::--[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 23:41, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
::::Check out [[potion of object detection]] now. What do you think? I've separated effects and messages, since people usually want to either (a) find out what a potion does, or (b) find out what a message meant. This is also why the message table is now arranged in reverse-lookup fashion. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 21:34, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

:::::Well, it sure is better, but actually I think a separate page with ''all'' messages from ''all'' potions ordered in that manner, reverse-lookup fashion, would be even better. People of part (b), who want to find out what a message meant, would not need to find out what the message meant if they had already identified the potion. Having not identified the potion, they will not find the potion page to see the messages there. Thus, having all messages alphabetically ordered and possible potions given next to them would be great. An example:
{| class="prettytable"
!Message
!Possible potions
|-
|"This burns like acid!"
|[[potion of holy water]] (if undead or chaotic)<br />[[potion of unholy water]] (if alive or lawful)<br />[[potion of acid]] (uncursed)
|-
|"This tastes like <fruit> juice."
|[[potion of fruit juice]] (non-cursed)<br />[[potion of see invisible]] (non-cursed)
|} --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 23:16, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

:: I second this idea. Also it would be nice to have a single page about [[identifying potions]] (linked from [[potion]]s and also [[identifying items]] ). The [[potion of object detection]] page should include strategy on using the potion. ie: using the potion to find vaults, to detect monsters with inventory, using when confused to generate alternate effects (none for this potion), etc. Also mentioned should be likely places to find this potion (independant of identification) and associated probabilities, ie Mines End (10% chance), nymphs (50% chance), etc  -- [[User:PraetorFenix|PraetorFenix]] 23:30, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
:::The page does indeed have a strategy section :) --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 10:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
:: I like this idea too, as an extension of the pages dealing with object identification. There's no reason to include messages like "You sense the presence of objects" as it should be perfectly obvious what potion generates that. Messages like "You feel a lack of something" are distinctly ambiguous and would be very useful arranged in a table as you describe. However! If we are going to leave messages out of the identification-helper table, then they need to be included in the potion page, for the sake of [[User:Jayt/Completeness|completeness]]. So I think the easiest way to accomplish this would be to fill out the potion pages will ''all'' messages, like for [[potion of object detection]], then pick and choose the ones useful for identification. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 10:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Source files and annotation ==

I've created [[potion.c]] using a script on my user page, with the intention of it being a convenient reference to link to from other articles. Since the source should be authoritative, this page should be protected from further edits. I hope to eventually upload the rest, so I'd find admin power rather useful. I hope my edit history demonstrates trustworthiness :)

(Regarding [[potion.c]], I know it conflicts with the names used for the existing annotated files, but I'm going to move those to something like [[potion.c annotations]].) --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 18:49, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

:This source code thingie should be discussed separately from your adminship request. I think [[Obj.h]] could be used as a model article. If I understood you correctly, you want two pages for each source file: the file itself, protected, and another, a copy of the file but with comments, such as [[Obj.h]] now? I personally think that only one article per each source file is enough. They shouldn't be protected so that everyone can comment them. '''''If''''' they are vandalized a lot, then we might consider some restrictions, but I think it's better to keep them open for now. There are many skilled source divers out there who don't have an account in this wiki.

:Oh by the way, see how I changed [[potion.c]]? It has still got the same features you implemented but I added a space in front of each row and removed all css-declarations, effectively saving some 60 kilobytes of space. :) Can you edit your script to generate output like that from now on? --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 21:44, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
::Good change! I was ''sure'' I'd tried that combination of wikisyntax, but hey :) The simpler code makes it easier to add annotations inline, so I'm more inclined to agree with you that only one page per source file is necessary, and of course, therefore, that it should remain unprotected.

::The xxxx-343.txt spoilers should be protected though. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 22:10, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

===Adminship request===

As per the above, I no longer have a specific need for admin powers, but if you, the powers that be (Kernigh, I believe?), want another admin I'd be happy to do the job. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 22:10, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

: No one has commented? If there are no comments then I expect to flag Jayt as a sysop later today. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:32, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

== Community Projects Page ==
It would be nice to have a list of current [[Community Projects]] that would act as an addendum to the '''Articles Wanted''' page. For instance Jayt is working on the standardization of objects, Lotte is working on the upload nethack graphics. It would be nice to have a list of these projects and their end goals.

On a related note we should also create a reference page, or [[Style Guide]], that discusses the format the articles should be in and acts as a guide to beginners (like me) who need a handy place to view a list of available templates and such. For instance, I'm having trouble finding a list of the available table formats (i.e.: wikitable, prettytable, etc).

-- [[User:PraetorFenix|PraetorFenix]] 03:47, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
: Good idea. I moved it to [[NetHackWiki:Current projects]] and will expand a bit on page standardisation. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 18:22, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
::Actually, I seem to have created a [[NetHackWiki:style guide|style guide]] in the process of writing about page standardisation. --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 19:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

== The Artifact... should [[artifact]] article names start with "The "? ==

We now have two articles: [[The Tsurugi of Muramasa]] and [[Tsurugi of Muramasa]]. And [[The Eye of the Aethiopica]] exists, leaving the links at [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Eye of the Aethiopica]] all broken.

It is true that [[NetHack]] includes "The " in its artifact names. We at [[NetHackWiki]] need to decide how to name the articles in [[:Category:Artifacts]] and how to handle the links. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

''Update:'' My current approach is to redirect "The XXX" to "XXX". This will cause a minor improvement in categories (not everything starts with T). Then in the "XXX" article, I bold '''The XXX''' at the start. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:48, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

: I feel somewhat responsible for the "The XXX" naming scheme -- I think this solution is fine. [[User:Eidolos|Eidolos]] 16:54, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

:It's mostly a non-issue thanks to redirects, but I would prefer the following:
:Artifact weapons have simple nouns for names, so they don't need to be called, e.g. "The Grayswandir", but all the quest artifacts are compound (hence countable) nouns, and require "the" in ordinary speech. We don't say "I think Eyes of the Overworld are better than Orb of Fate". So I think artifact weapons should not use The, and other arifacts should. This corresponds to their names in the source ([[artilist.h#line43]]) --[[User:Jayt|Jayt]] 17:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

:: I suddenly recalled that we have sortkeys (so in [[The Magic Mirror of Merlin]] one could use <nowiki>[[Category:Quest artifacts|Magic Mirror of Merlin]]</nowiki>. I now agree with Jayt; we should follow [[artilist.h]].

&&%s&& %s Vibrating square {147472 2022-08-12T08:44:09Z {4000978 Aximili} sectioning {{todo|Is the article sufficiently updated to reflect the strategic implications of teleporting onto the vibrating square as of 3.6.2, as well as monsters no longer avoiding it?}} 
{{level|Vibrating square level
 |from=19|to=23
 |branch=Gehennom
 |digfloor=no
 |digwalls=yes
 |bones=no
 |mapping=yes
 |teleport=yes
}}
The '''vibrating square''' is the [[square]] where the [[invocation ritual]] is to be performed for entry into [[Moloch's Sanctum]]. The square, once found, is automatically marked with a special map glyph {{magenta|~}}.

==Generation==
It is always located on the penultimate [[dungeon level]] of [[Gehennom]], which could be between levels 44 and 52. It is the lowest level that can be reached without performing the ritual; until the ritual is performed, there is no [[staircase]] leading down from that level. Only the [[Sanctum]] level has a higher dungeon level number.

The level with the vibrating square is in most other respects an ordinary maze level of Gehennom.

==Identification==
Confirm you are on the vibrating square level by checking that the floor is undiggable then read a scroll of [[gold detection]] while [[confused]] to quickly locate the vibrating square. You can also use a [[crystal ball]]. You must specify {{white|^}} to search for traps; specifying {{white|~}} will search for [[Long worm|long worms]] instead.

Another way to locate the vibrating square is to move over it, at which point you will get the message: "You feel a strange vibration under your <feet>.", or "You feel a strange vibration beneath you" if you are flying or levitating. This message will always occur if you walk on top of the vibrating square or jump (or hurtle) over it, but not if you are carried over it by an engulfing monster. There are no other special features of the square.

The vibrating square cannot appear near the edge of the screen nor the [[staircase]], because there must always be room for the ring of [[fire trap]]s and [[moat]]s to appear around it.{{refsrc|mkmaze.c|587}} Specifically, it will be at least five squares from the left and right sides of the map, at least four squares from the top or bottom, and not within a 23&times;23 square area centered on the upstair. It will also not be in a straight line with the upstair or on the same square as a trap, although it may be on the same square as a boulder or other item.

In this example map, the eligible places are marked with ({{green|X}}). Red spots are too close to the edge, blue ones in line with the stairs, and yellow ones too close to the upstairs. You can mouse over the map to see what is wrong with some of the squares.

==History==
In [[NetHack 3.4.3]] and older versions, the vibrating square was not marked on the map, and it could not be sensed when jumping or hurtling over it.

In [[NetHack 3.6.0]], the vibrating square was marked with {{yellow|^}}.

In [[NetHack 3.6.3]] and older versions, the player could not [[teleport]] directly onto the vibrating square, and monsters would also avoid it.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], the level with the vibrating square can have various types of borders instead of walls: clouds, lava, water, ice, or, worst of all, nearly indestructible iron bars. If you get any type of borders other than walls or iron bars, it is generally easier to scan the whole level line-by-line while levitating for the vibrating square. This is not quicker in game turns, since you are walking over more squares, and a careful speedrunner will still want to scan for the vibrating square normally.

In the case of clouds and ice, however, this will not work. The vibrating square can be placed on one ice and cloud squares, presumably since they can be walked over, and the whole eligible region of the level must be searched, not just the "path." If the vibrating square is made of ice, this can be melted as usual, leaving the square underwater.

===UnNetHack===

[[UnNetHack]] has the player start feeling vibrations when they step within two tiles of the square, regardless of intervening walls, making the search process much easier.

&&%s&& %s Invocation ritual {149727 2023-01-09T22:01:11Z {4001553 Danpritts} Reorder list of items in intro paragraph so they are in correct order of usage {{otheruses||the invocation of an artifact|invoke}}
In ''[[NetHack]]'', the '''Invocation ritual''' is an act performed by applying three [[Unique item|specific items]] on the [[vibrating square]] in a certain order: the [[Candelabrum of Invocation]], the [[Bell of Opening]], and the [[Book of the Dead]]. The invocation ritual is required to [[ascend]] and complete the game, being the only way to gain access to [[Moloch's Sanctum]].

All the objects involved in the ritual are unique and indestructible, with the exception of the [[candle]]s placed in the Candelabrum - any seven candles will do. [[Vlad's Tower]] is the only guaranteed source of candles in the game, but there are various additional sources - randomly generating them, purchasing from a shop (usually [[Izchak]]'s), finding them in a monster's inventory, [[polypiling]] from other tools, or even [[wishing]] for them if necessary. 

==Performing the Invocation==
The typical invocation sequence is as follows:

{|class="prettytable" style="width: 200px" class="wikitable floatright"
|
<div class="ttymap"><replacecharsblock>
default={{lightgray|$1}}
newline=<br>
|={{lightgray|&#124;}}

   }}}}}}}}}}}
---}}}}f}}}}}}--
  *  |.)...
</replacecharsblock></div>
|-
|Player successfully completing the invocation. The tiger will [[drown]] the next turn.
|}

1. Stand on the vibrating square.
{{message|You feel a strange vibration under your feet.}}
2. Light the [[non-cursed]] '''Candelabrum of Invocation''', which must have 7 [[candle]]s placed in it.
{{message|The candelabrum's candles burn brightly! The candelabrum glows with a strange light!}}
3. Ring the non-cursed, [[charging|charged]] '''Bell of Opening'''.
{{message|You ring the Bell of Opening. The Bell of Opening issues an unsettling shrill sound...}}
4. Finally, read the non-cursed '''Book of the Dead'''.
{{message|You begin to recite the runes. You turn the pages of the Book of the Dead... The floor shakes violently under you! The walls around you begin to bend and crumble! You are standing at the top of a stairwell leading down!}}

Lighting the Candelabrum and ringing the Bell can be performed in either order, but the Book ''must'' come last. The Candelabrum will remain lit for much longer than the effect of ringing the Bell, so if you are concerned about being interrupted, it is slightly safer to ring the Bell second - ringing the Bell first has the slight advantage of conserving one turn of light from the Candelabrum.

Performing the ritual will reveal the [[staircase]] down into [[Moloch's Sanctum]] in place of the vibrating square and create a ring of [[fire trap]]s immediately around you in a one-square radius - a massive [[moat]] of a roughly 4-5 square radius will also appear around you. 

===Mistakes during the invocation===
If you perform the ritual incorrectly, you might receive a [[The Book of the Dead#On the vibrating square|message]], or even [[The Book of the Dead#Raising the dead|raise the dead]].

There are a couple of methods to remembering the proper order - the most important points are that all three items must be non-cursed, and that the Book must be used last.

[[Sascha Wostmann]]'s guide to remembering the steps is: 
# Make some light to read by.
# Ring the bell to get the attention of the audience.
# Read the book to them.

Another way to remember the order of steps is to apply each item according to its depth in the dungeon: Bell ([[quest]]), then Candelabrum ([[Vlad's Tower]]), and finally Book (the [[Wizard's tower]]).

==After the ritual==
After the moat and fire traps are created, nearby monsters may be caught on top of one of the fire traps or drown in the moat - this breaks [[pacifist]] [[conduct]].

Once you have access to the staircase, you can levelport into the Sanctum, which can bypass the graveyard and sometimes even put you right into the [[temple]].

After the ritual is performed, none of the items are needed to [[ascension|win the game]], and you can safely drop them if you wish. However, they do have uses outside of the ritual. Keep in mind that you cannot put them in containers, and carrying them will not necessarily deter covetous monsters from stealing your [[quest artifact]].{{refsrc|wizard.c|275}}

* The Candelabrum makes an effective light source, shining one square further than a lamp - some players may take the Candelabrum with them, typically for [[jumping]] on the [[Astral Plane]]. Remember to extinguish it after the ritual if you do so, and don't re-light it too often, as it loses half its remaining life span each time.
* The blessed Book of the Dead can be used to pacify undead as a chaotic character, even while adhering to [[illiterate]] conduct.
* The charged Bell of Opening works as a [[wand of secret door detection]] to quickly enter Moloch's Sanctum, though it may take up to four uses to find the hidden door in the walls of the Sanctum.

==History==
The invocation ritual is first introduced to the game in [[NetHack 3.1.0]].

The motif of "Bell, Book and Candle" originated as a Catholic ritual of excommunication by anathema, although some works often portrayed it as connected with exorcism (e.g., the Terry Pratchett/Neil Gaiman novel ''Good Omens''). One notable occurrence of the motif is in the 1985 computer role playing game ''Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar'': the player must find the Bell of Courage, the Book of Truth, and the Candle of Love in order to enter the Abyss, the final dungeon of the game.<ref>[https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Great_Stygian_Abyss_(Ultima_IV) Wiki article on the Great Stygian Abyss at ultimacodex.com]</ref> A bell, book, and candle similarly provide access to the lowest levels of Hell in the classic text adventure ''Zork''.<ref>[http://www.eristic.net/games/infocom/zork1.html Zork 1 walkthrough]</ref>

'''L''', also known as '''Leon Arnott''' is the nickname of a person who posts on [[RGRN]] and is a prolific patch-writer. He is not to be confused with the world's greatest detective of ''Death Note''. Some of his patches include:

* Wearing a [[bag]] on your head
* Consistent [[gaze attack|gaze attacks]]
* Randomly-generated towns
* Coloured walls/floors
* More diverse monster spells

...amongst others.

Many of his patches have been incorporated into recent variants, including [[UnNetHack]].

&&%s&& %s Oilskin sack {138170 2021-03-02T00:13:23Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  {{tool|name=oilskin sack|tile=[[image:bag.png]]|appearance=bag|cost=100|weight=15|color=brown|material=cloth}}

The '''oilskin sack''' is a type of [[container]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''.

==Description==
The oilskin sack can hold items beyond the 52-character limit, much like the regular [[sack]], with the exception that a [[noncursed]] oilskin sack will also protect its contents from becoming [[wet]]. A [[cursed]] oilskin sack only protects its contents two-thirds of the time. 

==Strategy==
Oilskin sacks can be identified from the other types of bag by [[dip]]ping them into a [[water]] source; this will produce the message "Some water slides right off the bag." They are also fairly easy price-identified - if you encounter a bag with a base price of 100zm that can be safely #[[loot]]ed, and [[bag of holding|no weight change occurs]] when stashing heavier items, then you have an oilskin sack.

Combining an oilskin sack with a bag of holding is useful for obtaining both weight reduction and water protection, at the cost of slightly more tedium when accessing items in the nested bags; placing the bag of holding within the oilskin sack additionally protects the bag of holding from being [[Curse items|cursed]]. Blessing the oilskin sack is advisable to give the bag a layer of protection from being cursed itself, especially once you approach the [[Plane of Water]].

As with a plain sack, an oilskin sack can also be used to protect a [[wand of cancellation]] that is stored outside your main bag of holding; unlike a plain sack, the water protection allows you to keep other curse removal items such as a blessed [[scroll of remove curse]] inside as well.

==Encyclopedia entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Summer passed all too quickly.  On the last day of camp, Mr.
Brickle called his counselors together and paid them what he
owed them.  Louis received one hundred dollars - the first
money he had ever earned.  He had no wallet and no pockets,
so Mr. Brickle placed the money in a waterproof bag that had
a drawstring.  He hung this moneybag around Louis' neck,
along with the trumpet, the slate, the chalk pencil, and the
lifesaving medal.

&&%s&& %s Gaze attack {139162 2021-04-21T06:28:27Z {4001463 Actual-nh} Grammar/style Several monsters have "'''gaze attacks'''", which enables them to attack by glaring at you. You can protect yourself from these by [[blindness|blinding]] yourself in advance. Additionally, a blind or [[cancellation|cancelled]] monster cannot successfully use a gaze attack. Blinding yourself is more reliable, however. A monster's gaze is also rendered impotent if it is invisible, provided the victim cannot see invisible.  Finally, since 3.6.0, hallucinating has a 3/4 chance of protecting you from any [[gaze attack]].{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|1990|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/uhitm.c|2421|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

The following monsters have gaze attacks:
* [[Floating eye]] (passive [[paralysis|paralyzing]] gaze)
* [[Pyrolisk]] (fiery gaze that burns objects in your inventory)
* [[Archon]] (radiant gaze that blinds and stuns you)
* [[Umber hulk]] ([[confusion|confusing]] gaze)
* [[Medusa]] ([[stoning|petrifying]] gaze)
* [[Baalzebub]] ([[stun]]ning gaze)

==SLASH'EM==
The following new [[SLASH'EM]] monsters have gaze attacks:

* [[Glowing eye]] (same as Archon)
* [[Bloodshot eye]] (same as Baalzebub)
* [[Blinking eye]] (blinking gaze that teleports you)
* [[Catoblepas]] ([[fatal]] gaze)

'''Rodney''' is the bot which announces deaths on the #nethack@[[libera]] channel. He also has a simple database in which users can record useful information for each other; many good tips and advice are contained therein.

== Functionality ==
Notable parts of Rodney's functionality:
* '''Game announcements'''. Whenever somebody ends a game on [[nethack.alt.org]] (whether by death, [[ascension]], [[Escaping the dungeon|escape]], or #[[quit]]), Rodney will announce that fact in the channel. (Games that he thinks are [[startscumming]] are omitted.)
** In [[NetHack 3.4.3]], Rodney would also announce when a player [[Wish|wishes]], performs the [[Invocation]], or enters the [[planes]].<!--
** Rodney also posts to [http://twitter.com/nethackaltorg twitter].-->
* '''learndb'''. Any member of the channel can view/add/remove/edit items in Rodney's database. This is a useful repository of information as well as humor. In many ways it's a wiki without history.
* '''Search past games''' with the [https://alt.org/nethack/Rodney/lg.txt !lg command].
* '''URL shorthand''': "!wl article" returns a link to the wiki article
* '''Wiki announcements'''. Edits etc are announced in #nethackwiki.
* Many more, see [https://alt.org/nethack/Rodney/bothelp.php Rodney bot help].

&&%s&& %s DeathOnAStick {143352 2021-10-24T06:20:27Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''DeathOnAStick''' is a ''[[NetHack]]'' player, famous in the ''NetHack'' community for their year-and-a-half-long game on [[nethack.alt.org]], which ran from 2004-04-17 to 2005-11-27. They spent much of this time arduously [[polypiling]] [[rock]]s into [[gems]] and collecting pet [[giant]]s to carry the abundant [[bag]]s of gems for them.

After killing the [[Wizard of Yendor]] on [[dungeon level]] 1 and despite already being at [[experience level]] 30, they drank a [[potion of gain level]] found on his corpse. It was [[cursed]], as it turned out.

Upon reaching the [[Plane of Earth]], they desperately checked their inventory, and indeed they were carrying no gems. At this point, they went idle for 38 seconds. A few of their entourage of giants had been close enough to be dragged into the [[Elemental Planes|Planes]] with them, but they were either killed off or left behind at the inter-plane [[portal]]s. Ultimately, the only gems DeathOnAStick had at their [[ascension]] were 2 [[dilithium crystal]]s found on the [[Astral Plane]].

They tried again years later, ascending after 405 hours on August 16, 2010 with [https://s3.amazonaws.com/altorg/dumplog/DeathOnAStick/1264355342.nh343.txt over 8,000 gems].
