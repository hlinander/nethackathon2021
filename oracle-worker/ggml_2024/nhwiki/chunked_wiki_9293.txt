==== Valkyrie ====

– Removed escape spell school.
* Special spell changed to repair armor.
* Dwarven valkyries will start with a dwarvish bearded axe instead of a long sword, and are automatically proficient with it when using it to disarm weapons/shields.
* Since Valkyries don't have access to Excalibur * they are able to get the powerful Gungnir as compensation. Simply get a spear, enchant it up to +5, then pray while you have "pious" alignment. Your god will turn the spear into Gungnir for you.

==== Wizard ====

* Removed numerous weapons from being trained (axe, short sword, club, mace, polearms, spear, trident, shuriken). 
* Enchantment spell skill raised from skilled to expert, 
* Clerical spell skill lowered from skilled to basic. 
* Can sense if objects are magical in nature, much the same way a priest knows the beatitude of all objects.
* Wizards start with magic whistles, harps, flutes, and drums identified. Wizards can see the magical nature of tools, so by process of elimination a wizard should know these objects. Otherwise we get an awkward situation of seeing a magical whistle, then it auto-identifies when used to a magic whistle.
* New starting pet, the pseudodragon.

=== New player races ===

==== Centaurs ====

Centaurs are strong and fast, and can be just the thing if you are looking for a new twist on an old role. They have increased carrying capacity that matches the giant player race. Centaurs' strength and dexterity can be maxed to 20, but intelligence maximum is 12, wisdom is 14, and charisma is 16 (They may not make the best spellcasters but they sure can fight). Centaurs generate slightly more hit points per level vs a human player, and they start with intrinsic speed and the ability to jump (not like a Knight, but like wearing a pair of jumping boots). Centaurs know all bow and crossbow weapons automatically, and get a multishot bonus with either type.

Centaurs cannot wear boots, for hopefully obvious reasons. They can wear all other forms of armor (as can now their monster counterparts). Centaurs cannot ride anything as a steed due to them being quadrupedal.

Because they are a steed - centaurs have the unique position of being able to melee with polearms and lances as a mounted character would.

==== Tortles ====

Teenage Mutant Ninja Tortles!  These turtles, err, tortles... are a tanky new addition from EvilHack. Tortles are a humanoid reptilian race that resembles an upright tortoise, complete with a large protective shell on their back. They are larger than humans, and a bit stronger and wiser, but move slower and aren't quite so nimble. Tortles are typically of lawful alignment, but can be neutral as well if the role they chose allows it.

Tortles that start with a trident, the trident is rustproof.

Strength can get as high as 19 naturally, and they have a slightly increased weight carrying cap. Wisdom can go as high as 20, with dexterity capped at 10, and charisma capped at 14.

!Level 1:
|Swimming
|-
!Level 1:
|Magical Breathing
|-
!Level 5:
|Warning
|-
!Level 12:
|hungerless regeneration
|}

Tortles have a unique ability - they can hide inside their shell for up to 200 turns at a time, using the #monster command. While inside their shell, they are blind, cannot move or attack, and basically can't do much of anything except regenerate hit points/power and pray. But, while in their shell:
* they receive a massive 40 point boost to their AC, and only take half physical damage.
* the bite attacks of monsters that are large or smaller won't do any damage.
* they are impervious to stinger attacks, and being grabbed and crushed.
*  They can come out of their shell early if they so chose (same command used to enter), and will have to wait 300-400 turns before being able to hide in their shell again.

Tortles start with a natural AC of 0 due to their shells, but are extremely limited in what kind of armor they can wear. '''They are restricted to hats, gloves and shields only'''; hats and gloves made of any kind of hard or rigid material interfere with their ability to retreat into their shell (the Mitre of Holiness for tortle priests is an exception to this rule). As a tortle 'grows up' and gains experience, their shells grow thicker and become better able to repel attacks, giving the tortle an extra point of AC every three levels - this caps off at 10 points total for experience level 30.

Note: In Hack'EM tortles can wear mummy wrappings (since they can stay wrapped while in their shell), giving them one more valuable armor slot.

==== Giants ====

Make way! Here comes somebody who means business. The Giant. This race was craft in EvilHack and presents a nice balance of strengths versus weaknesses. This is Yet Another Race that can bring a fresh take to old roles, or be combined with new roles for an exciting adventure into the dungeons of doom.

Giants can be any of the four alignments (role restrictions enforced) and either gender. Giants have increased initial and maximum cap carrying capacity, with strength and constitution able to reach 25. Intelligence and dexterity are capped at 14, charisma at 16. Giants movement speed is slightly slower than other races due to their size.

* Giants have innate knowledge of certain gems, can ID touchstones and can dig as well as a dwarf.
* Other things in-game that require strength to accomplish are easier for Giants.
Giants can ride one creature and one creature only – the woolly mammoth, a new monster found only in EvilHack.

'''Offense for giants:'''
* Giants can pickup and throw boulders (the boulders stack and can be quivered). In Sokoban, the player is asked before picking up or moving aside a boulder.
* Boulders have a little bit of weight (8 aum instead of 6000 aum) when carried by giants. This prevents player giants from carrying hundreds of stacked boulders without penalty.
* Giants excel in bare-handed combat or with a club, and have a greater chance of stunning an opponent or shattering their wielded weapon.
* Giants can wield two-handed weapons in one hand.
* Giants take extra damage from slings (think 'David and Goliath').

'''Defense for giants:'''
* Hit point generation is significantly greater for giants per level vs a human player.
* Giants cannot wear body armor, cloaks, or shirts - with the exception of mummy wrappings which giants can wear.
* They have an innate lower armor class (AC 6 vs AC 10 when naked).
* Giant wizards start with an amulet of magic resistance.
* Giant samurai start with large splint mail. 
* Any giant can wear large splint mail * not just Samurai.

==== Hobbits ====

Is it time for second breakfast yet??  The hobbit was originally a race in SLASH'EM, but thankfully it had some fantastic updates in EvilHack we were able to inherit. Hobbits are small and humble - but don't underestimate them, just because they are small doesn't mean they are incompetent in the dungeon, quite the contrary.

Hobbits' alignment choices are lawful or neutral (role restrictions enforced). Hobbits can max dexterity, wisdom and constitution to 20, but strength, intelligence and charisma are capped at 16.

* Hobbits receive a multishot bonus with slings, knives, and daggers (if their role is capable of multishot).
* Everyone knows hobbits are all about food and when they can eat next. They start with the new 'food sense' intrinsic but are also innately hungry. Because of this, they start with extra food (if not a Convict) and a tinning kit (if not a Convict or an Archaeologist). They can also eat more than twice the amount of food other races can eat before becoming satiated.
* Hobbits prefer elven gear over anything else, and will start with said gear if it's available.
* Hobbits start out knowing Elbereth.

==== Illithids ====

Illithid is the formal name for a mind flayer. This ancient race has psychic abilities and are natural spellcasters, but are physically weak compared to other races. Illithids can only be of chaotic alignment (unless playing as an Infidel), and can be both male or female.

Intelligence and wisdom can go as high as 22, and dexterity as high as 20, but their strength, constitution and charisma are capped at 10/12/16 respectively.
Power generation per level gained is slightly higher than that of the elven player race.

Illithids have a natural psionic attack that can confuse and kill, and is tied to spell power use (but is not considered a spell for the purposes of Amulet of Yendor interactions). If your race is changed (e.g. by getting crowned as an infidel), this ability is lost.

* Levels 1-25: Deals 2d6 psychic damage
* Level 26+: Increases to 4d6 psychic damage.

Illithids have a single extra tentacle attack that behaves exactly like the tentacle attack from a mind flayer. This attack is set up in such a way that it will automatically not be used if attacking something the player should not touch unprotected (read: cockatrice). This attack does not work on a mind flayer. Conversely, illithids are immune to the mind flayer tentacle attack and zombie brain eating attacks.

==== Vampirics ====

Vampires have an interesting history in the NetHack world. They first surfaced in SLASH'EM, then in UnNetHack, dNethack, and SpliceHack. Each one was done a little differently, so we aimed to take the best of each and release a vampire that is fun but balanced. Our "vampiric" race starts you off strong, you won't have any cheesy poison or GWAWOD deaths, nor will you have to worry about sleeping gas traps or any of the floor traps that you can just fly over. What you *will* have to worry about is silver and fire: your new worst enemies. 

You'll also have to move quickly and attack aggressively to keep draining blood for food. The corpse draining mechanic from SLASH'EM has been removed. It created quite a few bugs in the nutrition code, it resulted in tedious draining of corpses (which often are wasted anyway), and a better alternative was found in SpliceHack, which was simply doubling the nutrition from feeding on life blood during combat. The main drawback to this approach is that now vampirics cannot gain intrinsics or benefits from eating corpses. To compensate, you start off with almost all the intrinsics a regular vampire enjoys.

'''Misc info:'''
* Vampirics get an extra attack – a drain life bite. This is how you will "eat" as a vampire. To maximize nutrition, you might want to fight bare-handed.
* Vampirics also get less natural HP regeneration while playing (about 1/3 of normal), instead they gain HP when they feed and successfully drain life.

* They start with both blood potions known.
* Vampires who wear an opera cloak get a +1 Charisma bonus
* Can be chaotic or neutral.
* The starting intrinsics for vampires have been buffed from SLASH'EM and UnNetHack to compensate for the lack of being able to build up resistances from draining corpses.

'''Weaknesses:'''
* Vulnerable to silver.
* Vulnerable to fire.
* Vulnerable to undead turning.
* Vampires can wield and wear silver items, but it damages them and blocks their natural regeneration
* Restricted in two-weapon skill.
* Start with a small penalty to luck (-1) and alignment (-5)
* Disabled #monster polymorph for the vampiric race.
* Since vampirics cannot eat food, they can't gain intrinsics or resistances from eating corpses.

==== Doppelgangers ====

How can you trust something that is constantly changing? Ask a doppelganger, better yet - play as one! The Doppelganger is a strange race, capable of taking on any form that it is familiar with. As you level up with a doppelganger, you will gain access to a greater variety and strength of forms.

Originally from SLASH'EM, this race gives the player the option to flex their knowledge of monsters. Being able to turn into the right monster at the right time is a key skill to success with playing doppelgangers.

* Added a list of all monsters doppelgangers have eaten to the stats menu (^X).
* Doppelgangers can lose memory of eaten monsters if hit with amnesia effects.
* Eating tinned corpses also added to eaten memory for doppelgangers.
* Every other race is hostile to doppelgangers (except were-foo).
* Doppelgangers know about polymorph items - also silenced u_init warning about unknown race (reported by cbus)
* More roles can be doppelgangers: arc, con, ice, nec, pri, rog.

=== Existing race changes ===

==== Elves ====

* Elves always start out knowing Elbereth.
* Elves can use musical instruments without risk of breaking them.
* Elves can always squeeze between two trees
* Elves and rangers get alignment penalty for cutting down trees
* Elves can only be lawful.

Elves have an aversion to iron – wearing or wielding anything made of iron that touches the players skin will prevent hit point regeneration, and will cause 1d8 physical damage on initial contact. Being hit with any weapon made of iron will do the same amount of extra damage. Elf-based monsters are affected the same way when being attacked with weapons made of iron and will avoid using items made of iron. Wielding an iron weapon without gloves incurs a -1 luck penalty.

No techniques for elves.

==== Dwarves ====

* Dwarves get an alignment bonus for cutting down trees
* All dwarven roles (except convict) have a chance of starting with a pick-axe.

* Orcs have an aversion to mithril – the same conditions above for elves and iron exists for orcs and mithril. They are also the only player race that can tame and ride a warg.

== The Quest ==

* Various changes have been made to each role's Quest to make the experience more varied and interesting for the player.

* The minimum experience level needed to be accepted for the quest has been lowered to 10 (from the default 14).
* If you've made your quest leader angry for whatever reason, this no longer makes the game unwinnable.
* You can engage them in battle, and if you kill your quest leader, this unlocks the quest. You can then complete your quest as you normally would. 
* Take heed, quest leaders are not weak and can prove formidable to a mid-level player. Also note that your deity isn't exactly thrilled with you killing off your quest leader. 
* Your alignment record can still be in the positive, but if you try any helm of opposite alignment shenanigans when it comes time to sacrifice the Amulet of Yendor at the endgame... interesting (read: bad) things can happen.

* Abusing your alignment can have a direct effect on how your quest ends. 
* Once you've defeated the quest nemesis and returned with your quest artifact and the Bell of Opening and speak with your quest leader, there's a chance they may ask you to actually return the quest artifact as they originally alluded to when you first accepted the quest. 
* Alignment abuse is tracked throughout the game – having your alignment negatively adjusted by one point also counts as one abuse point (this can be checked at any time via #conduct, and compared to vanilla, more feedback when abusing alignment is given). 
* Unlike your alignment record, which can be readjusted back into positive standing, your alignment abuse record is PERMANENT.
* Getting one abuse point means there's a 1 in 50 chance your quest leader will ask you to give up the quest artifact. 
* Racking up more abuse points increases those odds, to the point where if you've accumulated 50 or more abuse points, it's virtually guaranteed your quest leader will demand you return the quest artifact. 
* You have two options at this point – either hand over the quest artifact peacefully, or decline. 
* Declining will anger your quest leader, and they will attack. Handing over the quest artifact peacefully will flag the quest as complete. 
* Declining to turn over the quest artifact does not complete the quest – at some point your quest leader will need to be defeated before the quest is flagged as complete. 
* Also, attempting to evade your quest leader (whether they are peaceful or hostile) will do you no good in the long run, as the Bell of Opening has been 'cursed', and the only way to lift the curse is to complete the quest. 
* The Bell will not function for the invocation until this is done.

* Alternative scenarios have been taken into account, such as if you angered your quest leader before even starting the quest and you killed them, you simply need to defeat your quest nemesis to flag the quest as complete. 
* Conversely, if you've killed the quest nemesis and return, but somehow anger your quest leader before you speak to them, killing them also flags the quest as complete. 
* Some peace of mind – if you've never abused your alignment, your quest leader will never ask you for the quest artifact.


UPDATE: Quest leaders will make you forfeit the quest artifact only if you heavily abuse alignment (less than -64 alignment abuse score required)

Quest luck boon for completing quest with minimal alignment abuse (credit to mobileuser)

== Dungeon Features ==

=== Trap Mechanics ===

* Added ice traps (Un). Only generates after level 8.
* Added magic beam traps (evil)
* Magic beam traps cannot generate above level 16 (SlashTHEM)
* Magic beam traps now generate a random beam type on every trigger; before they were hardcoded to a single beam when created on the level.
* Can #untrap rust traps (they turn into fountains)
* Disarming rust traps from a distance (telekinesis or zapping acid) doesn't produce a fountain.
* Can #untrap fire traps (requires water)
* Untrapping a spear trap has a chance of yielding a spear or stake
* Allow force fighting of webs with a bladed weapon to destroy them
* Thrown items can get stuck in webs (3.7)
* The Castle drawbridge does not always close with the passtune
* Invisibility from magic traps is temporary.
* 1/7 chance a polytrap disappears after polymorphing a monster. (Splice)

'''wand of secret door detection:''' When broken this does not create a trap, however it will now detect traps and portals.

=== Grass ===

* Pulled from SpliceHack/xNetHack, we now have lush grass in the dungeon!
* Grass appears sparsely in the early levels, peaks around level 15, and then tapers off after level 22. 
* Hidey monsters can use grass as concealment.
* Fire and death rays scorch away grass and revert it to normal floor

=== Bloody Tiles ===

* Ported from SpliceHack
* When monsters are killed, they have a chance to spray blood in a random direction and color a tile red. No real effect on gameplay, purely aesthetic.
* The amount of blood depends on monster size.
* Spraying bloody tiles with a ray of water (ie: from a wand of deluge) will clear the tile of it's blood.
* When bloody tile is walked over, there is a 1 in 20 chance it will erode away.
* Orc blood is black.
* There is also a bloodless game option to play without the tile coloring.

=== Vents ===

* Ported from SpliceHack
* Vents appear after level 3. 
* After level 8, some vents will emit poison gas instead of harmless mist.
* Vents have a 3/5 chance of being destroyed when bombs are dropped or thrown into them, releasing a small earthquake in the process.
* Monsters can use vents to conceal themselves.
* Polymorphed sinks can turn into vents
* Spiders, snakes, and rats can randomly pop out of vents.
* Changed vent color to bright cyan to differentiate them from iron bars.

=== Toilets ===

Toilets are a bit silly, but they have been enhanced to be more interesting and useful!

* Ported from SLASH'EM
* Toilets can appear separate from sinks, in SLASH'EM they only appeared in pairs with sinks.
* Enabled fishing in toilets
* Dropping a ring of poly into a sink can poly into a toilet.
* Prevented toilet prayer while levitating.
* Toilet prayer can now stop the vomiting process (before it could not and you could vomit and still be in the vomiting process)

==== Toilet #kicking ====

* Kicking now only breaks the toilet 1/7 chance (was 1/4 in SLASH'EM)
* Kicking can generate cockroaches and sewage from kicking (1 in 17 chance)
* Kicking can generate brown puddings (only once per toilet)
* Kicking can generate a random tool, normally this tool will weigh under 15aum, but sometimes you'll get a large tool that bonks against the piping. If a large tool bonks 3x - you'll get that tool no matter now big it is and the toilet is destroyed in the process.		

==== Amulet identification in toilets (slex) ====

* Amulets can be dropped down toilets and possibly identified (similar to sinks and rings)
* Updated amulet feedback messages, blind effects, and hallucination effects.
* Amulets of Flying are always regurgitated from toilets.
* Amulets of Change will polymorph the toilet into a sink

=== Sinks ===

* Random sink effect: noxious gas cloud (from 3.7)

=== Forges ===

* Inherited from EvilHack
- Forges are introduced, which have the same appearance as fountains but are orange in color. Just like fountains, dipping things into them can have desirable or adverse affects. They can be used to dispose of anything that is flammable, and can also be used to repair corrosion/rust damage to any metallic object (if your luck is greater than 0). There is a rare chance that a lava demon can be summoned via dipping, which will be hostile most times, but can sometimes spawn tame (same odds as getting a wish from a water demon/fountain). Having negative luck can cause a forge to explode when used, which can cause considerable fire damage. Players can also use a forge to remove an attached ball & chain, and can also combine two objects to forge something new using the #forge command.
* Added new recipes for various imported weapons
* Forges don't appear until after level 2.
* Forges can be blown up by rays of water.


== Dungeon Changes ==

* Adjust secret passage frequency and exclude them from DL 1-4 (xnh)
* Random doors are secret less of the time (xnh)
* Kicking a "wall" that is actually a secret of some sort will never injure the player and will always produce an unambiguous message that there's something there. This makes it a valid strategy to kick every wall suspected of hiding something, because a single kick will give a yes/no on whether it's a regular wall or not. It's still not a *great* strategy, because the real walls will still hurt and wound legs like normal. (xnh)

* Extended the main dungeon: Now 35-39 levels deep
* Ludios appears on the first eligible level.
* Fort Ludios can also appear below Medusa's.
* Adjusted oracle (appears levels 5-9)
* The fountains in Delphi can sometimes cause hallucination (splice)
* The Rogue level has been removed
* Additional variants of the Castle, Fort Ludios, Sokoban, Mine Town and Mines End have been added.

=== Gnomish Mines ===

* Added new different types of gnomes, dwarves, and thieves.
* Added dwarf/gnome thieves to most town/Minetown variants. Evil added
* Monsters will usually be undead if you are a dwarf, gnome, or hobbit (from SLASH'EM) Instead of making undead dependent on your alignment, the chance scales with the dungeon depth. At the top of the mines, undead should be quite rare, but at mine's end beware.
    
* Imported Minetown variants from SlashTHEM and SpliceHack.
* Imported Mine's End levels from SlashTHEM
* Imported Gnome King ending from SLASH'EM, SlashTHEM.

=== Sokoban ===

* The last room of Sokoban has more prize variety, with a catch.
* Imported all of the levels from SLASH'EM, plus some new ones from SlashTHEM.
* Also imported all the new levels from NetHack Fourk.
* Following in the footsteps of NetHack Fourk, all levels have been given names to make them easier to reference.
* The map numbers in the listing below follow the format in the sokobon.des file (1-* is the top level and 4-* is the bottom level).

** The dungeon is pretty clean of themed rooms until level 8. 
** At levels 8, 11, and 17 we introduce more variety.

== Shops ==

* Shopkeepers can be a variety of different races; your race versus theirs directly affects pricing.
* Removed the racial shopkeeper price adjustments.

=== Shopkeeper Services ===

* Instead of every store offering a general Identify service - every shop offers premier identify servies based on their shop type or the race of the shopkeeper.
* Streamlined the service menu interface. Previously navigating the services was tedious. Now when you press 'p', you are immediately presented with a full menu of all the available services - no submenus within menus.
* Removed shopkeepers stealing all your money when you charge a wand of wishing. 
* Only Black Market can have the "identify any" service
* The service charge "smoothing" rewards higher charisma.
* All shop identify services are basic (and half price).

==== Firearms training service ====

* In addition to the weapon practice technique, this is a shopkeeper service for making firearms more accessible.
* Gun shops always offer this up to expert skill.
* Weapon shops, armor shops offer 20% of the time, up to max skilled.
* General stores offer it 10% of the time, up to max Basic.
** $500 for Basic skill
** $1000 for Skilled
** $2000 for expert?

==== Tinker service ====

* Only gnomes offer this service
* Allows you to upgrade an object to (usually) a better form, works the same as dipping an item into a potion of gain level.
* In Slash'EM this was implemented as a technique, but here the service only takes 1 turn (we'll assume the shopkeepers are very good at tinkering or just cheating and using a hidden potion of gain level behind the counter)
* Base charge is $500
* Non-gnomes are charged double
* Low intelligence (under 18 INT) players are subject to $100 price gouge
* Lower intelligence (under 13 INT) players are subject to $250 price gouge
