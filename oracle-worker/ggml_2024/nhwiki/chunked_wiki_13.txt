In this category:
* About 40% of potions will be gain ability, which benefit from blessing
* Cursed gain level can cause you to rise out of a shop with unpaid items
* Paralysis is dangerous
|}

===Applying===
Try to [[apply]] every new potion you find. If the potion lights, it will [[auto-identify]] as a potion of oil. Do not do this with an unpaid potion is owned by a shop, or you will be charged a [[Yendorian Fuel Tax]]. It is possible to avoid the charge by dropping everything else that can be applied besides the suspected potion, then hit {{kbd|a}}. If the potion is oil, you will be asked what to apply; if it isn't, you will be told that you have nothing that can be applied. This may be a bug.

===Quaffing===
When you have tried the above methods and all else fails, you can always quaff an unknown potion. However, this will not always identify it, and there are dangers. See [[potion quaffing effects]] for a comprehensive list of potion effects when quaffed.

Before you start quaffing, [[curse-test]] the potion, as quaffing a cursed potion is unwise&mdash;although you will still be able to identify it, you will miss out on some benefits of useful potions and suffer increased damage from harmful ones.

You should wait for your [[health]] to completely heal before quaffing. That way, should you quaff a potion of {{of|potion|healing|extra healing|or=1|full healing}}, your maximum health will increase. In addition, should you quaff a potion of {{of|potion|acid|or=1|sickness}}, it will be much less likely to kill you outright.

====Surviving harmful potions====
Before drinking a potentially harmful potion, there are some things you can do to prevent or at least minimize the risks. Additionally, after drinking a harmful potion, there are ways to cure the bad effects. These are summarized in the table below.

{|class="prettytable"
!Potion
!Risk minimizers
!Cures
|-
|{{of|potion|sickness}}
|
* potion is blessed, or
* you are a Healer
|
* non-cursed [[potion of restore ability]]

** {{of|potion|extra healing}}
** {{of|potion|full healing}}

* non-cursed unicorn horn
|-
|{{of|potion|confusion}}, {{of|potion|booze}}
|
* potion is blessed
|
* prayer
* blessed scroll of confuse monster
* eating a [[lizard]] corpse (reduces timeout to 2 turns)
* non-cursed unicorn horn
|-
|{{of|potion|polymorph}}
|
* you have [[polymorph control]], or
* you have [[unchanging]]
|
|-
|{{of|potion|paralysis|sleeping}}
|
* wearing a [[ring of free action]] is the best countermeasure
* if you can't use the ring
** lock yourself in a [[closet]]
** stay on shallow [[dungeon level]]s with easy monsters
** kill all nearby monsters
** keep your [[pet]]s nearby
* [[sleep resistance]] protects against sleeping, not paralysis
|
|}

Perhaps, a Healer with a lizard corpse and ring of free action who is also wielding Grayswandir while wearing the Eyes of the Overworld and an amulet of unchanging would be in a good position to quaff-identify potions without fear. However, most players manage to find a unicorn horn before any of those other items.

====Interpreting messages====
If the potion is not automatically identified, the message is often helpful to identify it.

{|class="prettytable"
!Message
!Possible potions
|-
|You feel great, good, or mediocre
|{{of|potion|restore ability}}
|-
|You feel better
|either {{of|potion|restore ability}} ("Wow! This makes you feel better!"), or {{of|potion|healing}} ("You feel better")
|-
|tastes like "liquid fire" or "dandelion wine" (maybe "watered down")
|{{of|potion|booze}}
|-
|you have an "uneasy feeling"
|
you either

* quaffed a cursed [[potion of gain level]] while being at one of the following
** the first level without [[Amulet of Yendor]]
** an endgame level
** [[Sokoban]]
** [[Fort Ludios]]
** the top floor of the [[Wizard's Tower]], [[Vlad's Tower]], or the [[Quest]]
|-
|it tastes "rotten", "overripe", or its taste has something to do with [[slime mold]] or your favorite fruit
|potion of either {{of|potion|see invisible|or=1|fruit juice}} (aka slime mold juice). However, if you were invisible, could not see invisible already, and were not blind, it must be a fruit juice.
|-
|it tastes "foul"
|cursed [[potion of gain ability]]
|-
|you feel "threatened", or you "get the heebie jeebies"
|[[potion of monster detection]] without monsters on the level
|-
|it is something about your leg or legs (they "feel somehow better", or "get a new energy")
|[[potion of speed]]
|-
|your eyes itch, or your eye itches
|either a [[potion of blindness]] or a [[potion of hallucination]]
|-

|[[potion of blindness]] or a [[potion of hallucination]], and you are an eyeless monster
|-
|you "rise up, through the ceiling"
|cursed [[potion of gain level]]
|-
|it "burns", or the potion feels sour or tangy
|if it was not water (a clear potion), then it was acid
|}

If you have a "peculiar feeling for a moment, then it passes", it can be several cases:
* [[Potion of hallucination]] while already hallucinating, or while being hallucination resistant (i. e. via wielding [[Grayswandir]])
* [[Potion of invisibility]] while already invisible, blind, or wearing a [[mummy wrapping]]
* Blessed [[potion of monster detection]] while already having monster detection
* [[Potion of confusion]] while already being confused
* Non-cursed [[potion of gain ability]] while having [[sustain ability]]
* [[Potion of levitation]] while already levitating

If you have a "normal feeling for a moment, then it passes", it can be the same as peculiar feeling while hallucinating, or it can be a potion of blindness or hallucination while you are an eyeless monster.

==Damage==
Fire and cold attacks can cause potions in your main inventory or on the ground to boil or freeze and be destroyed. This does not happen to potions in a [[container]], so it is generally advisable to stash potions in one when possible. Potions boiled by fire attacks are vaporized, which can subject you to the effects of the [[vapors]]; potions frozen by cold attacks will not release any vapors.

==Dilution==
Most potions will become diluted when they get [[wet]], either through immersion in open water, or [[dip]]ping into open water, a fountain, or another potion. This will not happen when dipping into holy water or unholy water&mdash;those potions change the [[beatitude]] of the dipped item without actually getting it wet, and are consumed in the process; potions of water also cannot be diluted.

Diluted potions are listed as such in your inventory, and they will not stack with non-diluted potions, but function largely the same as their undiluted counterparts. This can be a minor hassle if your intention is to bless a group of potions with holy water, or if you have no [[container]] and inventory slots are at a premium. There are also some exceptions, mostly minor:
*A diluted potion of booze will not cure 1HP of damage, as a non-diluted one will.
*A diluted potion of see invisible will give somewhat different messages, though the effect is the same.
*A diluted potion of fruit juice gives half the nutrition of a non-diluted one.

If a diluted potion is diluted a second time, it will lose any blessed or cursed status, and become an uncursed potion of water. This is often used for making holy water, and provides a reason for most characters to hold on to otherwise useless or harmful potions.

There are some exceptions to the above principles:
*A potion of acid will not dilute, but instead cause an explosion that does damage to the character. If your character dies as a result of this, the cause of death will be listed as "elementary chemistry."
*A potion of water can not be diluted, which is not surprising, but this means that holy water and unholy water are also immune to dilution, as they are simply blessed or cursed potions of water, and losing beatitude is a consequence of dilution.
*Alchemy will not dilute an already-diluted potion, so it is safe to convert a potion of healing into a diluted potion of extra healing, and then into a diluted potion of full healing.

[[Alchemy]] is a somewhat complicated process which has a few wrinkles of its own; players are advised to study that article for more information before alchemizing, unless they enjoy picking imaginary shards of glass out of their faces.

==Thrown potions==
Potions may be [[wield]]ed or [[throw]]n in combat by you or other monsters. A monster has an 80% chance of taking 1 HP of damage when hit, while you may receive 1 to 2 HP of damage. If you don't see the potion hit the monster, you will get the message "Crash!" A monster hit by a potion is subjected to its effects, but generally to a lesser extent than from quaffing it; however, a thrown potion has a chance of missing the target, in which case it will shatter without affecting them.

When a potion shatters, it is possible for the vapors to affect monsters in adjacent squares, including the player. For this reason, wielding a potion hand-to-hand can be riskier than throwing it from a distance, although in this case the potion will only shatter when it hits the monster. Circumstances will ultimately dictate which is more preferable for hitting a given monster, e.g. wearing a [[ring of free action]] and wielding a potion of paralysis.

== Smoky and milky potions ==

[[Smoky and milky potions]] are special.  Regardless of their other properties, [[quaff]]ing a smoky potion has a chance of releasing a [[djinni]], and quaffing a milky potion may release a hostile [[ghost]].

== Messages ==
{{message|You have a peculiar feeling for a moment, then it passes.|You quaffed a potion, but it had no noticeable effect, e.g. quaffing a potion of blindness while already [[blind]].{{refsrc|potion.c|530|nethack=3.6.0}}}}

{{encyclopedia|
POTABLE, n.  Suitable for drinking.  Water is said to be potable; indeed, some declare it our natural beverage, although even they find it palatable only when suffering from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which it is a medicine.  Upon nothing has so great and diligent ingenuity been brought to bear in all ages and in all countries, except the most uncivilized, as upon the invention of substitutes for water.  To hold that this general aversion to that liquid has no basis in the preservative instinct of the race is to be unscientific -- and without science we are as the snakes and toads.

'''Wands''' are limited-use magical devices that may be [[zap]]ped or [[engraving|engraved]] with. Any character can zap a wand, but all wands have a specific number of charges. When all charges have been used, the wand will either do nothing or function one last time and then turn to dust (1/121 chance) – this is known as [[wresting]] a last charge out of the wand. A wand can also be [[charging|recharged]].

When a wand is identified, additional information is displayed in parentheses <code>Wand of X (Y:Z)</code>. Y = number of times it has been recharged. Z = current number of charges. A current charge count of -1 is a special case indicating that the wand has been cancelled.

A wand's effect is not known before it is identified: they only appear by description, such as "an ivory wand" (see {{sa|Appearance|sectionsign=1}}).

All wands have a weight of 7.

Wands (other than the [[wand of lightning]]) have a 1 in 3 chance of exploding when subjected to [[shock]] damage.{{reffunc|zap.c|destroy_item}}

===Generation===

Wands make up for 4% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 6% in containers, 5% on the Rogue level, and 8% in Gehennom. The Prob column above is the relative probability of each subtype. They appear {{frac|34}} (~3%) cursed, {{frac|16|17}} (~94%) uncursed, and {{frac|34}} (~3%) blessed.

Wands are generated with a random number of charges depending on their type, according to the table below:{{refsrc|mkobj.c|577}}
{|class="prettytable"
!Wand type
!Starting charges
|-
|Wand of wishing
|1 to 3
|-
|Other non-directional wand
|11 to 15
|-
|Directional wand
|4 to 8
|}

Wands are generated with their [[Charging|recharge counter]] set to 0.

Wands are also generated in the inventories of monsters, for their use, with a probability depending on the type, level, and [[difficulty]] of the monster:
* Random [[defensive item]]s (difficulty-dependent): [[wand of teleportation|teleportation]], [[wand of create monster|create monster]], [[wand of digging|digging]]
* Random [[offensive item]]s (difficulty-dependent): [[wand of death|death]], [[wand of striking|striking]], [[wand of magic missile|magic missile]], [[wand of sleep|sleep]], [[wand of fire|fire]], [[wand of cold|cold]], [[wand of lightning|lightning]]
* Random [[miscellaneous item]]s (difficulty-dependent): [[wand of polymorph|polymorph]], [[wand of speed monster|speed monster]], [[wand of make invisible|make invisible]]
* [[Shopkeeper]]: [[wand of striking|striking]] (always), [[wand of magic missile|magic missile]] ({{frac|4}} chance)
* [[Minotaur]]: [[wand of digging|digging]] ({{frac|3}} chance, except 100% chance on plane of earth)
* [[Master lich]]: [[wand of nothing|nothing]] ({{frac|91}} chance)
* [[Asmodeus]]: [[wand of cold|cold]] and [[wand of fire|fire]]
* [[Dispater]]: [[wand of striking|striking]]
* [[Orcus]]: [[wand of death|death]]

The [[Castle]] always contains a [[wand of wishing]] in one of its tower rooms.

===Appearance===

The appearances of wands are randomized from the following descriptions:
 glass       balsa       crystal     maple       pine
 oak         ebony       marble      tin         brass
 copper      silver      platinum    iridium     zinc
 aluminum    uranium     iron        steel       hexagonal
 short       runed       long        curved      forked
 spiked      jeweled

Only marble wands turn to [[meat stick]]s when hit by the spell of [[stone to flesh]], and only glass or crystal ones shatter from a [[force bolt]]. Wielded silver wands will do [[silver]] damage. The appearance of a wand also affects its susceptibility to erosion, which is largely cosmetic and has no implications on its functioning. (Erode-proof wands are very rare but can be wished for.) Iron, steel, hexagonal, short, runed, long, curved, spiked, and jeweled wands can rust or corrode; copper ones corrode; and wooden wands (oak, balsa, ebony, maple, pine, and forked) might also erode with fire and/or rot, but this has not yet been verified.

===Direction, beams, and rays===

The type of wand denotes the behavior when it is zapped. Non-directional wands do not ask for a direction. [[Beam]] wands ask for a direction, but do not show a visibly animated effect when zapped. [[Ray]] wands produce a ray that is animated on the screen; if you are unblind when you zap the wand, you will also identify that type of wand. Rays may [[ray#Bouncing rays|bounce off walls]] or be [[reflection|reflected]].

If a ray hits a wall orthogonally or at an internal corner it will bounce straight back. If it hits a wall diagonally or an external corner, there is a 5% chance it will bounce straight back, otherwise it will change direction 90 degrees, with equal chances of being deflected left or right. Note that on diagonal wall bounces, the ray actually penetrates the wall one square, possibly hitting any phasing monsters in the wall.{{refsrc|zap.c|3476|comment=ray bouncing}}

Note that a directional wand (or [[Directional spell|spell]]) may affect not only the first object or creature it hits, but several others behind it. An example of this is healing your pet and a few hostile monsters as well&mdash;or zapping not only your pet with a [[wand of speed monster]], but also a [[shopkeeper]], angering him.

===Range===

The range of a beam wand is 6 to 13 squares.{{refsrc|zap.c|2470|comment=beam wand range}} For each monster hit, range decreases 3.{{refsrc|zap.c|2717|comment=beam hit monster}} For each square in which objects are affected, range decreases 1.{{refsrc|zap.c|2744|comment=beam hit object(s)}} Beams don't bounce and can't be reflected.

The range of a ray wand is 7 to 13 squares.{{refsrc|zap.c|3308|comment=ray wand range}} For each monster hit, range decreases 2.{{refsrc|zap.c|3434|comment=ray hit monster}} If fire passes over water or a fountain, or cold passes over water or lava, the ray may stop entirely or have its range decreased 1 or 3. If fire passes over scrolls or spellbooks, some may burn, but range isn't decreased.{{reffunc|zap.c|zap_over_floor}} Each time it bounces off a wall, range decreases by 1.{{refsrc|zap.c|3483|comment=ray bounce}} Reflection off a monster or you reverses the direction of travel, but range doesn't decrease.{{refsrc|zap.c|3346|comment=reflecting ray}}

===Hitting and missing===

Most beam wands always hit, but the monster may resist.{{reffunc|zap.c|bhitm}}{{reffunc|zap.c|resist}}

When [[Engulfing|engulfed]] by a monster, non-digging ray wands{{refsrc|zap.c|3292|comment=special case for non-digging ray wands when engulfed, to line 3306}} and wands of striking will always hit. Otherwise, the chance of hitting depends on the target's AC.

A wand of striking never hits targets with an AC of &minus;9 or lower, always hits targets with an AC of 11 or higher, and for intermediate AC values has a (9 + AC) in 20 chance of hitting.{{refsrc|zap.c|128|comment=striking chance of hitting, you zapping monster}}{{refsrc|muse.c|1117|comment=striking chance of hitting, monster zapping you}}{{refsrc|muse.c|1128|comment=striking chance of hitting, monster zapping monster}}

Both against you and against monsters, the odds of hitting with a ray wand is exclusively determined by armor class.{{reffunc|zap.c|zap_hit}}

The table below shows the chance of a monster or player being hit by a ray from a wand (not accounting for possible rebounds).

[[Image:Zap_HitProbabilitiesAC32.svg|thumb|Graph of wand and spell hitting probabilities given various target ACs and spell_bonus values]]
Because the chance of spells hitting is affected by the player's Dexterity and skill level in the appropriate spell school, one may choose to attack a monster using a spell instead of the corresponding wand: for example, against Master Kaen wearing a +0 robe, a monk with 23 Dexterity who has reached Basic in Enchantment spells will hit with the sleep spell 86.25% of the time, whereas a wand of sleep only hits 47.5% of the time.

===Attack wand damage===

To calculate the damage done by an attack wand, first the base damage is calculated:

* 2d12 for [[wand of striking|striking]]{{refsrc|zap.c|129|comment=striking damage}}
* magic missile 2d6{{refsrc|zap.c|2915}}{{refsrc|zap.c|2490|name=nd|comment=This is passed to the <tt>nd</tt> parameter of {{function|zap.c|buzz|x}} which passes it on to {{function|zap.c|zhitm|x}}, determining the number of dice.}}
* fire, cold, and lightning 6d6{{refsrc|zap.c|2929}}{{refsrc|zap.c|2949}}{{refsrc|zap.c|3016}}<ref name="nd"/>

If the wand is a [[wand of fire]] and the target is [[cold resistance|cold resistant]], 7 additional points of damage are added.{{refsrc|zap.c|2930}}

If the wand is a [[wand of cold]] and the target is [[fire resistance|fire resistant]], 6d3 additional points of damage are added.{{refsrc|zap.c|2950}}<ref name="nd"/>

Fire, cold, and shock resistant monsters will take no damage from fire, cold, and lightning wands respectively.{{refsrc|zap.c|2925}}{{refsrc|zap.c|2945}}{{refsrc|zap.c|3011}} Monsters with player-style [[magic resistance]] will take no damage from striking and magic missile.{{refsrc|zap.c|125}}{{refsrc|zap.c|2911}} All monsters have a chance, based on their level and [[monster magic resistance]], of resisting and taking half damage.{{reffunc|zap.c|resist}}

Attack wands (other than striking and magic missile) can also destroy inventory items:

* Fire can damage burnable armor and destroy scrolls, potions and spellbooks.{{refsrc|zap.c|2938}}
* Cold can destroy potions.{{refsrc|zap.c|2958}}
* Lightning can destroy rings and wands.{{refsrc|zap.c|3032}}

==Using wands==

You may {{kbd|z}}ap or {{kbd|E}}ngrave with a wand. That consumes one charge each time. [[#Breaking_wands|Covered below,]] {{kbd|a}}pply destroys wands.

Zapping a wand with zero charges left usually yields "Nothing happens". But with a 1 in 121 chance, it instead wrests one last zap and then turns the wand to dust.{{reffunc|zap.c|zappable}} A cancelled wand is shown as "-1" charges and will always turn to dust ineffectively if you use it.

Cursed wands have a 1% chance of exploding if zapped {{refsrc|src/zap.c|1839|version=NetHack 3.4.3}} but they otherwise function as normal. Since [[NetHack 3.6.0]], cursed wands may also explode when used to engrave.{{refsrc|src/engrave.c|630|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

[[Engraving]] with a wand is a good way to work out its [[identification|identity]]. Also, engraving with a wand of [[wand of fire|fire]] or [[wand of lightning|lightning]] is the only way to make truly permanent writing. E.g. an [[Elbereth]] that cannot degrade. How many characters you engrave determines how many turns it takes, but it always costs one charge.

You can zap or break with a wand without free [[hand]]s, e.g. when wielding a cursed two-handed weapon; engraving requires [[hand]]s.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|Though this is still true, you can no longer zap a wand if polymorphed into a form that lacks hands. You cannot apply anything, including wands, in this situation either.}}

===Recharging wands===
{{main|Charging#Wands}}
Wands may be recharged by [[scroll of charging|scrolls of charging]] or by the [[Platinum Yendorian Express Card]]. Previously-recharged wands have a chance of exploding (up to a maximum of 100% for a 7:x wand or a 1:x wand of wishing).

A cursed scroll will not change the number of charges in a blessed wand or a wand with no charges; otherwise, "Your <wand> vibrates briefly" and its charges is set to zero. An uncursed scroll will bring the number of charges to a random number from 1 to a random number between 5 and the maximum charges shown above (or for a wand of wishing a random number from 1 to 3); a blessed scroll will bring the number of charges in the wand to a random number from 5 to the maximum charges shown above, or for a wand of wishing to three charges. If it already has that number of charges, it gains one more charge. A wand of wishing charged beyond three charges will explode. "Your <wand> <glows/vibrates> briefly" if the new enchantment is below the maximum; "Your <wand> <glows blue/vibrates> for a moment" otherwise.

Cancelled wands can be recharged the same way as empty wands. It effectively uncancels wands.

===Breaking wands===

You can destroy a wand by {{kbd|a}}pplying it. You will be prompted for confirmation, and you must have hands and enough strength. Balsa wands require 5 strength to break; other wands require 10. Wands with no charges and some wands listed below have no effect ("But nothing else happens..."). Breaking a wand with no charges may (with the usual 1/121 probability) [[wrest]] some final charges from it, in which case it will act like a wand with between one and three charges.{{refsrc|src/apply.c|3341|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

Most wands will produce an explosion when broken. The explosion causes damage to yourself and any monsters that were in the adjacent squares when you broke the wand. This damage can be reduced or eliminated if you (or the monster) has an appropriate resistance. Damage is also reduced to half for Healers and Knights and to {{frac|5}} for Monks, Priests and Wizards. Further effects can occur as if you had zapped yourself with the wand. The explosion can also affect objects in your inventory, on your square, and on adjacent squares, and affect locations as if they were zapped. Finally, some types of wands have explosions that make you identify the wand.

Specific effects are detailed below. In any case, you destroy the wand and owe the cost if it was unpaid.

==Identifying wands==

===Engrave-identification===
The easiest and safest way to identify with a wand is to [[engrave]] with it. To do so, first write something in the dust with your fingers ("[[Elbereth]]" is a good safe default choice that exercises Wisdom to boot; [[illiterate]] characters can use "x"), then engrave something else with the wand. You may get a message or effect giving a clue as to what the wand is.

This won't work if you are blind, levitating, or not on a writable floor.

Engraving with a wand uses up one charge (possibly wresting the last), but if the wand is nondirectional, it performs its usual effect.

Create monster, enlightenment, light, and wishing perform their usual effect and will self-identify prior to the game giving you the engraving prompt; wands of secret door detection also self-identify, but only if they find anything. A wand of lightning will blind you if you engrave with it; you can either cure the blindness promptly, or else abort when prompted for the text you want to engrave and avoid it entirely. This also works for a wand of create monster if you are standing on a functional Elbereth and the monster you generated warrants its use.

Also, be careful concerning the identical message for wands of make invisible, teleportation, and cancellation; you don't want to end up teleporting yourself or cancelling a pet by accident. The safest way to find out the exact identity is using the wand on a non-blank scroll or non-clear potion you neither need nor care if a monster picks it up (for example, [[scroll of light]]). If nothing happens, it's make invisible; if the item disappears, it's teleport; if the item blanks/clears (or turns into fruit juice if you're using [[potion of sickness]]), it's cancellation.

One "optimal" method to identify a wand with no message is to line up the corpse of a monster and a [[container]] in front of a door, with either the door or the container locked and the other unlocked, and zap the wand in that direction. If the corpse is revived, the wand is undead turning; if the contents of the container are revealed, the wand is [[wand of probing|probing]], and will be formally identified as such; if the container (or the door) locks, it is [[wand of locking|locking]], and will be formally identified as such; and if the door (or the container) unlocks, it is [[wand of opening|opening]], and will be formally identified as such. Otherwise, the wand is [[wand of nothing|nothing]], and will remain unidentified. If the wand does not prompt you for a direction, it is either [[wand of secret door detection|secret door detection]], or, in some games, nothing.

===Identification by zapping===
A good way to determine the identity of a wand that makes engravings vanish&mdash;at the cost of using a second charge&mdash;is to do this: line up an item and a monster and zap them. If they both vanish it was teleportation, if the monster vanishes it was make invisible, and if neither vanishes it was cancellation. You can also place a [[junk]] scroll on the ground and zap it. If it disappears, the wand is teleportation. If the scroll is blanked, the wand is cancellation. If nothing happens, it's make invisible. This technique doesn't result in an invisible monster.

Many wands will self-identify on zapping. A single zap under the right circumstances can identify nearly all of these: stand in a room where you know there is an undetected trap or door (messages such as ''Vlad was here'' or ''ad aerarium'' indicate such a door), and another door that is closed but unlocked. Drop an object that can be recognizably cancelled (such as a junk scroll) on a diagonal to the door (to prevent dangerous beams from hitting you), and lure a visible undead monster onto the same diagonal line. Zap toward the object, monster, and door. If both object and monster vanish, the wand is teleportation; if the monster vanishes and the object doesn't, it is make invisible; if the scroll is blank, it was cancellation; if the door opens, it was opening; if the door is now locked, it was locking; if the monster flees, it was turn undead; if the hidden door appears, it was secret door detection. If nothing happens, it was a wand of digging or of nothing, or it was empty of charges. If it was any other kind of wand, it will self-identify.

===Price-identification===

Almost any class of items can be [[price identification|price-identified]], but there are two groups of wands for which this is exceptionally useful. Wands of wishing and wands of death are covered in the [[price identification]] article; both have base cost 500. In addition, the four wands with base cost 175 are all very useful in the early or middle game. Wands of cold, fire, and lightning provide a powerful ranged attack. Wands of fire and lightning offer an instant method of engraving Elbereth. Freezing water with a wand of cold is one way to cross it or to deal with [[sea monster]]s and their dreaded instakill. And wands of sleep are great all the time.

==Strategy==
{{main|Wand strategy}}

===Polypiling===
{{main|Polypiling}}

Non-directional wands come with lots of charges, which are preserved on polymorph. Polypile them if you lack powerful offense, teleportation, or cancellation wands.

Wands are quirky when polymorphed; unlike many other objects, where the greatest risk is sundering and golem generation, their quality will quickly degrade. The most useful wands are wishing (to wish for a wand of death), death (to clear a five-lane highway to the [[Castle]]'s wand of wishing), polymorph, digging, secret door detection, cold, and teleportation. Most others, by the time the player has a means to polymorph objects, have long since become useless. The two most useful&mdash;wishing and polymorph&mdash;will never appear in polymorphs, so don't try.

By the time the player seriously considers polypiling, they'll have all the wands of teleportation they're likely to need. The same goes for digging&mdash;and additionally, a [[pick-axe]] can work in a pinch for a slower means of clearing a pre-amulet fast-track to the [[Plane of Earth]]. For many players, secret door detection has one use and ''one use only''&mdash;getting through [[Gehennom]] and [[Moloch's Sanctum]] fire traps ''that much faster''. And there, they may instead opt to carry the [[Bell of Opening]] just a few steps further to serve this purpose. Wands of cold are useful for freezing moats and lava, but even there a player is likely to greatly prefer a [[ring of levitation]].

==Variants==
===AceHack===
In [[AceHack]], engraving will formally identify the wand if that gives an unambiguous message (e.g. [[wand of cold|cold]] or [[speed monster]]).

===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], cursed wands explode 20% of the time (not just 1%) when zapped, but never explode when engraved with. Curse-test your [[wand of wishing]]! Also, exploding wands in SLASH'EM are much more dangerous to anyone caught in the explosion: many wands have their standard effects (cancellation, death etc.) on whoever is inside the explosion's radius. Most attack wands also cause a high amount of elemental damage upon exploding, capable of instakilling a low-level character.

SLASH'EM wands, other than the [[wand of wishing]], generally have 4 more charges than a vanilla NetHack wand would have: <ref>[[Source:SLASH'EM_0.0.7E7F2/mkobj.c#line679]], compare with vanilla's mkobj.c</ref>
{|class="prettytable"

!Starting charges
|-
|Wand of wishing
|1 to 3
|-
|Other non-directional wand
|15 to 19
|-
|Directional wand

|}

====Engrave-identification====
In addition to the vanilla table:
{|class="prettytable"
!Message/effect
!Possible wand
!Notes
|-
|"The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!"
|draining (if engraving was short)
|Given when short engraving is erased; no message if no existing engraving
|-
|"The engraving looks different now.
|draining
|For longer existing engravings; message is shared with polymorph, but wand erodes engraving instead of changing it
|
|-
|"The bugs on the floor run away!"
|fear
|Wand does not self-identify, but message is unambiguous
|-
|"The bugs on the floor look healthier!"
|healing/extra healing
|Zapping yourself with the wand will then cause it to self-identify.
|-
|}

A [[wand of create horde]] will have its usual effect when zapped. This can be dangerous to weaker characters, so having an [[escape item]] ready may be a good idea. Wands of create horde are quite rare, however.

===SlashTHEM===

There are additional wands in [[SlashTHEM]]. Some of them automatically identify when engraved with, others will give a message:
{|class="prettytable"
!Message/effect
!Possible wand
!Notes
|-
|"The bugs on the <floor> seem to be covered with goo!"
|acid
|Wand does not self-identify, but message is unambiguous
|-
|"The bugs on the floor are blown away!"
|wind (also exists in [[SporkHack]])
|Wand does not self-identify, but message is unambiguous
|
|-
|"The engraving on the <floor> shines brightly for a moment!"
|solar beam
|Wand does not self-identify, but message is unambiguous
|-
|"The bugs on the <floor> speed up!"
|haste monster
|This message is shared by the wand of speed monster. Zap it at yourself to see which one it is: speed monster permanently gives you the "fast" intrinsic, haste monster makes you "very fast" for a period of time.
|-
|"The bugs on the <floor> look healthier!"
|full healing
|This message is shared by the wands of healing and extra healing. Zap it at yourself or a monster for a less ambiguous message.
|-
|"The engraving is blurred, and you think you can see it twice!"
|clone monster
|Only appears if there was an existing engraving. There is no other wand that gives this message; the text of the actual engraving doesn't get cloned though.
|-
|"You are surrounded by darkness!"
|darkness
|You identify the wand, and the area surrounding you becomes unlit.
|-
|"You feel insightful!"
|identify
|You identify the wand, and can identify some items in your inventory.
|-
|No message
|bugging
|You identify the wand, and some bugs and heisenbugs are summoned around you to fight.
|-
|}

===UnNetHack===
When some wands are broken, in addition to the vanilla effect, sometimes a [[trap]] is created. The chance of creating a trap is (charges – 3)/(charges – 2), or zero if the wand does not have at least 3 charges.

{|class="prettytable"

===Wand rebalance===
[[FIQhack]] and [[NetHack Fourk]] rebalance wands to scale on a new skill, the ''wands skill''. The aim is to make several wands more useful for a longer duration of the game. For more details, see [[Wands Balance Patch]].

== Encyclopedia entry ==

'Saruman!' he cried, and his voice grew in power and authority.
'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed.  I am
Gandalf the White, who has returned from death.  You have no
colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'
He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice.
'Saruman, your staff is broken.'  There was a crack, and the
staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it
fell down at Gandalf's feet.  'Go!' said Gandalf. With a cry
Saruman fell back and crawled away.

The '''sink''' is a [[dungeon feature]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]'', represented by a hash ({{Lightgray|#}}).

==Description==
Sinks have a varying amount of effects depending on how they are interacted with:

* Sinks will cause anything in the air above them to "sink" to the floor, be it thrown [[weapon]]s or your [[levitating]] [[hero]]. Falling into a sink while levitating will deal up to 25 damage, killing you if you're unlucky.

* [[Sit]]ting on a sink will produce the message "Your rump gets wet" with no other effect.

* [[Kick]]ing a sink or [[quaff]]ing from it has its own set of effects - most of them are negative, though there a few notably beneficial ones.

* Dropping [[ring]]s into a sink will cause them to be lost down the drain, with a message that enables you to identify the ring.

* [[Digging]] down on a sink will turn it into a (non-magical) [[fountain]] (which can then be dug down onto to produce [[pool]]s for [[wet|blanking and diluting]] if so desired).

If there is a sink on the current dungeon level, [[You hear|you will occasionally hear a "gurgling noise" or a "slow drip"]].

===Kicking===
Kicking a sink produces one of several possible effects:

{{message|Klunk! The pipes vibrate noisily.|[[Dexterity]] is exercised, and this wakes nearby [[sleeping]] monsters.}}
{{message|A black ooze gushes up from the drain!|A [[black pudding]] is summoned, and dexterity is exercised. This happens once per sink.}}
{{message|The dishwasher returns!|A [[foocubus]] of opposite sex to the hero is summoned (or of random sex if the hero is [[polymorph]]ed into a neuter form); dexterity is exercised. This happens once per sink.}}
{{message|Flupp! Muddy waste pops up from the drain.<br>You see a ring shining in its midst.|Once per sink, a ring is generated on the sink's square, and dexterity and [[wisdom]] are exercised; the latter message is omitted if a ring was already produced this way.}}
{{message|Ouch! That hurts!|You lose up to 5 hit points, abuse dexterity and [[strength]], and possibly end up with a wounded leg.}}

===Quaffing===
You can drink from a sink by using the [[quaff]] command while standing over it. Upon doing so you get a message hinting at the resulting consequences. The specific message you receive depends on your status and the condition of dungeon [[monster]]s.
