It is frequently convenient to dig through the walls of [[maze]]s, to make shortcuts between the stairs and minimize the chances that the [[Wizard of Yendor]] will show up when you're racing to the upstairs. Similar shortcuts can also make it more feasible to carry [[sacrifice]]s to altars from adjacent levels.

Digging is an essential part of the [[metastrategy]] [[digging for victory]].

You can identify undiggable levels by attempting to make a hole by digging. If you can't make more than a pit, it is an undiggable level. This is particularly useful for identifying the deepest level of Gehennom, where the [[vibrating square]] is located; this level otherwise looks like another level of Gehennom. If you don't want to move deeper when the level ''is'' diggable, you can [[levitation|levitate]] and zap a wand of digging or cast the spell downward.

Frequently, digging out of or into a room can be easier (and sometimes faster in game time) than searching for a [[secret door]].

Some areas, such as [[vault]]s and the luckstone in the Gnomish King's Wine Cellar, can be most easily accessed by digging.

&&%s&& %s Do you want your possessions identified? {139275 2021-04-27T03:25:23Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  '''"Do you want your possessions identified?"''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DYWYPI?''') is the message displayed upon the end of a ''[[NetHack]]'' game through [[death (character)|death]], [[ascension]], [[escaping the dungeon]], or [[quit]]ting. Accepting with '''y''' shows you your [[inventory]]. It is common for this to reveal one or more items that would have prevented your death. It often provides helpful information for new and unspoiled players to take into future games.

If you are killed in a [[shop]], or by a shopkeeper you will get an alternative message: "Do you want to see what you had before you died?", since the shopkeeper will gratefully inherit your possessions if peaceful, or take your inventory as compensation if he was angry.

As the DYWYPI check counts as item identification, it exercises [[wisdom]].

This message has reached memetic status in the ''NetHack'' community, due to usually being the first message you see when the game is irretrievably over, and an [[amulet of life saving]] didn't revive you. It is frequently used to suggest a character's death, often when [[YASD|due to a stupid mistake]].

==Variants==
While the phrase naturally retains its purpose in variants, it may occur in other places within them as well.

[[xNetHack]] may randomly give you the phrase "Do you want your possessions identified?" when reading a [[cursed]] [[scroll of identify]].

Some players distinguish YASD from '''YAAD''' ('''Yet Another Annoying Death'''), using YAAD or [[DYWYPI]] for random, unavoidable events such as falling onto [[Spiked pit|poison spikes]] (provided the [[pit]] wasn't already known, of course) or an encounter with a [[Gnome With the Wand of Death]], and reserving YASD for pilot error. The dividing line depends on the player; to an expert, almost all deaths are avoidable YASDs.

Amusingly enough, YASDs can happen to [[monster]]s as well, such as bouncing a beam off a wall back at themselves.

&&%s&& %s Scroll of genocide {148029 2022-08-31T21:23:47Z {4000114 Derekt75} /* Messages */ The "Such creatures no longer exist" is for genocided mons only.  If extinct, the normal message prints for uncursed, and "Nothing happens" for cursed. {{scroll
 |name=genocide
 |cost=300
 |ink=15-29}}

The '''scroll of genocide''' is a type of [[scroll]] that appears in ''[[NetHack]]''. It is considered one of the most powerful and rare [[scrolls]] in the game.

==Generation==
Roughly ~1.5% of all scrolls found in the dungeon will be scrolls of genocide.

==Description==
Reading a scroll of any [[beatitude]] will [[auto-identify]] it, regardless of whether you choose to genocide any monsters; monsters will not read this scroll. The effects when read depend on the scroll's [[beatitude]], including [[confused]] readings:

{|class="prettytable"
!Beatitude
!Effect
!Confused effect
|-
|Blessed
|colspan="2"|You may genocide a chosen [[monster class]].
|-
|Uncursed
|You may genocide a chosen monster species.
|You genocide your own role, causing [[instadeath]].
|-
|Cursed
|4-6 monsters of the chosen species are summoned.
Monsters generated this way do not carry any inventory.
|4-6 hostile [[player monster]]s of your role are summoned.
Monsters generated this way do not carry any inventory.
|}

If [[hallucination|hallucinating]], an uncursed or cursed scroll's ''message'' will substitute your role for the monster specified, but the actual effect remains unchanged. Monsters that were already generated prior to being genocided are removed, dropping any inventory they had even if they were on a different floor - killing monsters this way does not break the [[pacifist]] [[conduct]], though you may specify "none" or "nothing" to a noncursed scroll if you wish to keep genocideless conduct intact; specifying either to a cursed scroll will choose a random species for the generated monsters.

Tins made from genocided monsters will be empty when opened, and you cannot polymorph into a genocided monster. There is no alignment penalty for genociding a species that would include current [[pet]]s or [[peaceful]] monsters, but there is a small [[alignment record|alignment]] penalty for a lawful character that genocides any human species; a chaotic character gains a small boost to alignment for doing the same.

==Strategy==
{{main|Genocide}}
The scroll of genocide is one of the player's most powerful tools ''and'' one of the most dangerous - a confused reading of an uncursed scroll is ''immediately and irreversibly fatal''. Blessed scrolls still function as normal even if read while confused, but can still bring an unexpected end to your game if you are careless - '''''do not''''' use one to genocide [[mind flayers]] while reading one as a [[dwarf]], and be sure not to typo while genociding master mind flayers as a [[Monk]]!

Uncursed scrolls of genocide are a useful emergency aid that allows you to quickly eliminate incredibly troublesome monsters bearing down on you - this tends to work best against monsters such as [[soldier ant]]s that generate in groups. Blessed scrolls are often used to eliminate entire classes of annoying or potentially lethal monsters such as [[lich]]es; players commonly use a blessed scroll on the [[ascension run]] just as they enter the [[Plane of Water]] in order to get rid of the [[sea monster]]s that appear and minimize their odds of [[drowning]].

Conversely, the effects of a scroll of cursed genocide (also known as "[[reverse genocide]]") are frequently used to gather the corpses of desired monsters, such as [[wraith]]s or [[dragon]]s. Another common ascension tactic is to read a cursed genocide scroll or two on the [[Astral Plane]], generate [[purple worm]]s, then use a [[scroll of taming]] on them; the player then breaks a [[wand of teleportation]] to send as many worms as they can around the level, leaving them to clear paths to the altars.

For a detailed list of common genocide/"reverse genocide" targets, see the main article linked above.

===Identification===
At a base cost of 300 [[zm]], the scroll of genocide shares its base cost with the [[scroll of punishment]]; reading an unidentified 300zm scroll is especially perilous and can potentially be fatal if you do not know its beatitude - this is ''especially'' true if you are confused. If you read a known scroll of genocide, especially without knowing its beatitude, be sure you are '''''not''''' confused - apply a [[unicorn horn]] a couple of times beforehand to make sure.

When using a genocide scroll of unknown beatitude, it may be ideal to choose a low-level monster to genocide (e.g. [[leprechauns]] or [[newts]]) so that you are not immediately swarmed to death if it is cursed. Alternately, [[semonsters such as the [[kraken]] may be a viable option - while normally fairly high-level at minimum, they immediately become scared while on land and will not attack; caution is still advised, as they may still lash out if cornered or you are occupied, e.g. by digging. [[drowning]]. If the scroll is cursed, you can kill the monsters somewhat easily for a nice bundle of experience - if the scroll is non-cursed, you wipe out a major late-game nuisance and lower your risk of drowning.

==History==
The scroll of genocide has been present in the game since Hack 1.21, a port/variant of [[Jay Fenlason's Hack]].

==Messages==
{{message|You have found a scroll of genocide!|You read a scroll of genocide and auto-identified it.}}
{{message|What monster do you want to genocide? [type the name]|You read a cursed or uncursed scroll.}}
{{message|What class of monsters do you wish to genocide?|You read a blessed scroll.}}

{{message|A thunderous voice booms through the caverns: 'No, mortal!  That will not be done.'|You read a cursed or uncursed scroll, and selected an ungenocidable species.}}
{{message|You aren't permitted to genocide such monsters.|You read a blessed scroll and tried to genocide a monster class that only contains ungenocidable monsters.}}

{{message|Such creatures no longer exist in this world.|You read a cursed or uncursed scroll, and tried to genocide a species that was already genocided.}}
{{message|All such monsters are already nonexistent.|The scroll was blessed, and you tried to genocide a monster class that already has all its genocidable members genocided.}}

{{message|Wiped out all <[[foo]]>.|You successfully genocided one of the selected monsters.}}
{{message|You aren't permitted to genocide <foo>.|The scroll was blessed and at least one of the monsters in the monster class is genocidable, but <foo> is ungenocidable. This message will be given for every monster in the class that cannot be genocided.}}
{{message|All <foo> are nonexistent.|The scroll was blessed and at least one of the monsters in the monster class is now successfully genocided, but <foo> was already genocided beforehand. This message will be given for every monster in the class that was already genocided.}}
{{message|Wiped out all <role/race>.|You wiped out your own race or role; if you are killed this way, the game proceeds to the [[DYWYPI]] screen, and the end-of-game screen reports you as "killed by genocidal confusion".}}
{{message|You feel dead inside.|You genocided your own race, but were polymorphed into another at the time. If you quit after getting this message without polymorphing back, the end-of-game screen reports that you "quit while already on Charon's boat."}}
{{message|Sent in some <foo>.|You read a cursed scroll and successfully "reverse genocided" some monsters.}}
{{message|Nothing happens.|You read a cursed scroll, but no monsters were created, perhaps because they are [[Extinctionism|extinct]].}}

==Variants==
===UnNetHack===
In [[UnNetHack]], a blessed scroll of genocide works like an uncursed one in vanilla ''NetHack'', i.e. it allows a single monster to be genocided, rather than a monster class; an uncursed scroll instead kills all of a single monster on the current level.

===SpliceHack===
In [[SpliceHack-Rewrite]], the scroll's functions are unchanged, though it is renamed the '''scroll of annihilation''' to avoid certain implications from use of the word "genocide".

Most vanilla targets for genocide are similarly applicable in SpliceHack, as well as several of the newer dragons introduced.

&&%s&& %s Genocide {145532 2022-04-18T20:47:30Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Variants */ In ''NetHack'', '''genocide''' is the act of wiping out all members of a certain race by magical means. This is unrelated to [[extinctionism]], a voluntary challenge which consists of killing all the creatures in the game by yourself.

==Description==
Genocide can take place in the form of a [[scroll of genocide]] or you may get to genocide one monster when #[[sit|sitting]] on a [[throne]]. Genocides gained from a throne are always safe, while scrolls may not be if they are cursed or if you are [[confused]].

If you want to keep a genocideless [[conduct]], you can always answer "none" when asked what to genocide. Specifying an invalid race five times in a row will also result in nothing being genocided and your conduct will be preserved.

Genocide does not break the [[pacifist]] [[conduct]]. There is no penalty for genociding a species including current [[pet]]s or [[peaceful]] monsters, but there is a small [[alignment record|alignment]] penalty for a lawful that genocides a single human species; a chaotic gains a small boost to alignment for doing the same.

When a species is genocided, all living monsters of that species will be killed, and no new ones will generate. Genocide will also prevent monsters (and the [[hero]]) from polymorphing into the chosen monsters. Monsters killed in this way will drop their inventory, even if they are on a different floor.

==Restrictions on genocide==
The following creatures cannot be genocided:
* all {{white|A}} [[angelic being]]s
* all {{white|&}} major [[demon]]s, [[Riders]], [[mail daemon]]s, [[djinn]], and [[sandestin]]s
* all {{white|'}} [[golem]]s
* all {{white|E}} [[elemental]]s, but not [[stalker]]s
* {{monsymlink|titan}}s
* {{monsymlink|salamander}}s
* all [[werecreature]]s
* {{monsymlink|skeleton}}s
* {{monsymlink|ghost}}s and [[shade]]s
* all {{white|@}} except [[nurse]]s, [[doppelganger]]s, randomly generated elves, your own [[role]], the [[Watchman|Watch]], and the [[Yendorian Army]]
* all [[unique monster]]s

Don't blessed genocide {{white|@}}; additionally, don't blessed genocide {{white|h}} if you are a dwarf, {{white|G}} if you are a gnome, or {{white|o}} if you are an orc. And keep in mind that blessed genociding always wipes out the entire class even if you specify a particular monster. If you genocide your base race or role, you will [[instadeath|die]]. Variants of your base race are safe to genocide; for example, as a [[gnome (starting race)|gnome]], you could genocide [[gnome lord]]s or [[gnome king]]s, but choosing "gnome" to genocide is fatal. An [[amulet of life saving]] will not save you from death by genocide. This is usually only an issue with [[dwarves]]; see [[Genocide#Common genocides|below]].

Genociding {{white|@}} while [[polymorph]]ed  will result in a [[YAFM]]: "You feel dead inside." You will die if you revert back to your normal form, and the only way to survive is by wearing an [[amulet of unchanging]], or either ascend or escape the dungeon before you unpolymorph.

==Reverse genocide==
Reading a cursed scroll of genocide will create 4&ndash;6 of the specified monster. This is what makes reading a non [[BUC]]-identified scroll of genocide dangerous. However, it can work to your advantage if the resulting monsters are useful and can be killed easily.

Here are some useful monsters to reverse genocide:
* {{monsym|wraith}} [[wraith]]s: to eat their corpses for a level gain (average of about 1.6 corpses per scroll read). Don't do this on a level with a [[graveyard]], or you'll get significantly fewer corpses.
* {{monsym|white_dragon}} [[dragon]]s: a dangerous way to make [[dragon scale mail]]
* {{monsym|nurse}} [[nurse]]s: to [[nurse dance]]
* {{monsym|tengu}} [[tengu]]: to eat for a possibility of [[teleport control]]
* {{monsym|kraken}} [[kraken]]: easy experience as they are very slow out of water. Be aware that although they tend to run away, they still attack occasionally â€“ but of course they cannot drown you out of water. (Average of about 7870 XP per scroll or enough to go from level 10 to 11. If you are level 11 or higher, wraiths are a better bet to level up.)
* {{monsym|mind_flayer}} [[mind flayer]]s: to eat for [[intelligence]] gain; be sure to be standing on a [[scroll of scare monster]]
* {{monsym|stone_giant}} [[giant]]s: to eat for [[strength]] gain
* {{monsym|white_unicorn}} [[unicorn]]s: to eat for [[poison resistance]], to sacrifice if cross-aligned, to throw them [[gem]]s for [[Luck]] if coaligned, and for [[unicorn horn]]s to use as is or to [[polypile]] into other magical tools such as [[magic marker]]s
* {{monsym|purple_worm}} [[purple worm]]s: combine with [[tame|taming]] or [[ring of conflict]] and a [[wand of teleportation]] to easily clear out large open levels full of powerful monsters
* {{monsym|cockatrice}} [[cockatrice]]s: to use their corpses to quickly deal with powerful monsters (chickatrices are lighter but less likely to leave a corpse)

[[Vegetarian]]s can reverse genocide [[gelatinous cube]]s for the intrinsics once they can defeat them and take the acidic corpse damage. Monks going for speed runs or the [[pacifist]] and [[atheist]] [[conducts]] will find that useful, because they do not want to lose alignment for eating meaty corpses. Alignment loss is relevant, because of the early game alignment cap for speed runners, and because raising alignment is so hard for pacifist atheists.

For monsters that you want to eat, especially those that provide a large amount of nutrition, it is valuable to have a [[tinning kit]] on hand when reverse genociding.

You cannot reverse genocide a monster that cannot be genocided or that has already been genocided or [[extinct]].

Reverse genocided monsters do not spawn with any items, so you can't farm [[athame]]s from [[lich]]es that way. They do leave [[death drop|death drops]] such as [[unicorn horn]]s and [[dragon scales]].

Reverse genociding does not break the genocideless [[conduct]].

==Emergency genocide==
The scroll of genocide is a useful [[escape item]] as it can instantly kill a monster which poses an immediate threat and cannot be dealt with in any other way. For example, a sea monster holding you, a single monster about to take your last [[hit point]], or a [[nymph]] who is robbing you blind. (The nymph will drop whatever she is carrying, so you'll get your stolen items back.) Keep in mind however that some monsters cannot be genocided.

==Common genocides==
Some species are widely considered to be so nasty, or so annoying, that they merit genocide as soon as possible:
* {{monsym|lich}}, [[lich]]es
* {{monsym|mind_flayer}}, [[mind flayer]]s
* {{monsym|shark}}, [[sea monster]]s
* {{monsym|rust_monster}}, [[rust monster]]s and [[disenchanter]]s

It is nearly always best to postpone genocide until you can bless your scroll, because the worst monsters don't appear until later. This gives you plenty of time to build up a cache of [[holy water]]. Note that if you are a dwarf, genociding {{white|h}} with a blessed [[scroll of genocide]] is [[instadeath|instantly fatal]]!

If a quest-related monster race is genocided, it will generate more monsters of a quest-related class. If this class has monsters which are useful (common reverse genocide targets), genociding the race has beneficial effects.

==No genocides==
It can be argued that many species are a source of useful items and properties, and hence genociding actually makes NetHack harder. Liches sometimes provide [[athame]]s, mind flayer corpses can boost intelligence, sea monsters are trivial for a well equipped player to deal with, etc. It is also impossible to polymorph into a genocided creature, which may limit your options in certain situations (such as using the mind flayer's mind blast to alert monsters to your presence). This viewpoint usually advocates genociding only [[mimic]]s, as this will slightly increase the number of items present in shops, especially in [[Orcus Town]].

Another possible exception is sea monsters, which although trivial can be annoying or cause [[YASD]] by inattention. These are not randomly generated, so genociding them does not affect random generation.  Since they typically liveâ€”and therefore dieâ€”in water, they are not normally a significant source of corpses or items (although electric eels are a potential source of shock resistance if you can recover the corpse). [[Electric eel]]s and [[giant eels]] might make a good use of any single-species genocides that happen to be granted, saving mimics for a class genocide.

Another problem with genociding is that it can increase the chances of getting more difficult, ungenocidable monsters. This is especially true for the [[summon nasties]] monster spell - summon nasties is normally restricted to a set of monsters, however if a genocided monster would be created a random monster is generated instead, based upon normal monster generation odds. If the player is carrying the [[Amulet of Yendor]] and is outside of [[Gehennom]] there is a decent chance that an [[Archon]] or [[Ki-rin]] will be generated, which are significantly more of a threat than the normal list of nasties '''and''' are capable of summoning nasties themselves.

Finally, some NetHack players abstain from genociding because they value a cursed genocide far more. In the mid-game, you can obtain bonuses from reverse-genocided monsters such as [[dragon scale mail]], [[Luck]] increases, experience levels, attribute boosts, [[unicorn horn]]s, intrinsics, and maximum hit point increases. In the late game, regular genocide is not that useful, because players are powerful or skilled enough to handle genocide candidates anyway.

A player who wishes to maintain genocideless [[conduct]] can answer "none" or "nothing" when prompted for which species to genocide.

==Wizard mode genocide==
[[Wizard mode]] offers an additional option for genocide: entering <tt>*</tt> for your genocide choice on a blessed scroll wipes out all enemies on the level, even those you can't see. This includes normally ungenocideable monsters, tame monsters, peaceful monsters, and everything else that isn't you. It doesn't truly genocide anything though, and anything that happened to be wiped out can still show up later. In contrast to normal genocide monsters killed in this way do NOT drop their inventory.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], [[titan]]s can be genocided, as can [[werespider]]s (unlike other lycanthropes).

Good targets for SLASH'EM genocide, beyond the ones included above for vanilla, include:
* High-level spellcasters: the endgame can be quite tough with them constantly summoning nasties.
** {{monsym|vampire mage}}, [[vampire mage]]s: higher level than a master lich but not covetous, meaning they will gladly sit outside their ring of nasties and continue summoning. Also can be created by [[summon nasties]] itself.
** {{monsym|ghoul queen}}, [[ghoul queen]]s: a rare monster. It has the same base level as a demilich, but it has two spellcasting attacks. Can only be found in [[graveyard]]s or through the new summon undead monster spell.
** {{monsym|gnoll shaman}}, [[gnoll shaman]]s: they hide until attacked, so you can leave them alone. If awakened, they will cast both clerical and arcane spells and are absurdly high-level for both.
** {{monsym|titan}}, [[titan]]s: they can be genocided in SLASH'EM
* Mid-level spellcasters: they can [[curse items]] and tend to be fast
** {{monsym|ghoul mage}}, [[ghoul mage]]s: very annoying and very commonly summoned by liches with the summon undead spell
** {{monsym|leprechaun wizard}}, [[leprechaun wizard]]s: like a leprechaun, they will teleport away after successfully stealing gold. Also like a leprechaun, they can be left sleeping.
** {{monsym|brownie}}, [[brownie]]s: also worth genociding, because their stealing attacks are more likely to hit than those of other nymphs, since they have a higher base level. Like nymphs though, they can be left sleeping.
* Some other monsters with annoying or dangerous attacks
** {{white|x}}, [[electric bug]]s: shock bite can explode rings and wands
** {{monsym|migo queen}}, [[migo queen]]s: they eat brains but are rarer and less threatening than mind flayers
** {{monsym|basilisk}}, {{monsym|asphynx}}, [[basilisk]]s and [[asphynx]]es: both are strong and fast [[petrify|petrifying monsters]]
** {{monsym|troll mummy}}, [[troll mummy|troll mummies]]: for those who don't like to deal with [[troll]]s' regeneration. Eating their corpses isn't a terrible idea if you have a well-enchanted unicorn horn, but pets won't eat them.
** {{monsym|rot worm}}, [[rot worm]]s: they cause [[sickness]] with their bite and are often generated by [[summon nasties]]
** {{monsym|koala}}, [[koala]]s: they can untame any pet, making it peaceful, even if the koala itself is peaceful. This can be avoided by taming it with [[eucalyptus leaves]].
** {{monsym|water hulk}}, [[water hulk]]s: almost identical to [[umber hulk]]s including the [[confusion|confusing]] gaze

Reverse genociding [[gypsy|gypsies]] is a source of up to 120 wishes: use one of the summoned gypsies to wish for a magic marker, write another cursed scroll of genocide, then repeat! You do need a source of gems or gold to do this, however such items are easily found in SLASH'EM, especially from greater golems.

A careful reverse genocide of [[giant shoggoth]]s is a good way to gain the [[teleport control]] intrinsic.

=== UnNetHack ===
In [[UnNetHack]], a blessed scroll of genocide works like an uncursed one in NetHack, i.e. it allows a single monster to be genocided, rather than a [[monster class]], and an uncursed scroll instead kills all of a single monster on the current level.

The '''cockatrice''', {{monsym|cockatrice}}, is one of the more complex creatures in [[Nethack]], and is generally considered to be a real nuisance, as it is often the source of many [[YASD]]s. It can [[stoning|turn you to stone]] [[instadeath|instantaneously]] if you touch it (or even its [[corpse]]) with your bare hands (or any other part of your body). However, if you are wearing [[gloves]], you can pick its corpse up and wield it as a weapon, turning enemies to stone instantaneously; the cockatrice corpse has been nicknamed the '''rubber chicken''' by the players who like to use it in this way. This is still extremely dangerous, as falling in any manner will cause you to touch it. Monsters with gloves or [[stoning resistance]] (such as [[skeletons]]) can also wield cockatrice corpses against you.

The baby version of a cockatrice is a '''chickatrice''', {{monsym|chickatrice}}, and is similarly dangerous; while they may appear earlier than cockatrices, chickatrices are much weaker, rarer, and less likely to leave a corpse. Chickatrices and cockatrices are often collectively referred to as [[foo]]trices, particularly in reference to the stoning abilities they and their corpses possess.

In addition to normal monster generation, floors below DL 17 may rarely generate [[cockatrice nest|a nest full of cockatrices]] as a [[special room]].

== Hissing attack ==
If you hear the cockatrice's hissing, there is a chance that you may begin turning to stone. If you immediately act to counter this process, you can save your life, but any intrinsic [[speed]] will be lost. The hissing attack always succeeds during a [[phases of the moon|new moon]] unless you are carrying a [[lizard corpse]].

For a cockatrice to start turning you to stone, the following must all happen:
# The cockatrice must touch you with its petrifying touch attack. ('''"The cockatrice touches you."''')
# Then, there is a {{frac|3}} chance the cockatrice will hiss at you if it has not been [[Cancellation|cancelled]]. ('''"You hear the cockatrice's hissing!"''')
# Finally, there is a 10% chance (or 100% if today is a [[Time#Moon phase and date|new moon]] and you are not carrying a [[lizard corpse]]) that you will begin [[Stoning|turning to stone]]. ('''"You are slowing down."''' at the end of the current game turn)

[[Magic cancellation]] will not protect you against the hiss, although [[Cancellation|cancelling]] the cockatrice will prevent it from hissing ('''"You hear a cough from the cockatrice!"'''). Good [[AC]] can prevent a cockatrice from touching you. Note that cancellation's only effect on cockatrices is to block their hissing attack; it does not protect you against petrification due to contact with the cockatrice, living or dead. To prepare for the loss of intrinsic speed, you may [[tinning kit|tin]] the corpse of a [[quantum mechanic]] and eat the tin after stopping the stoning process, or zap yourself with a [[wand of speed monster]].

== Ways to be petrified by a cockatrice ==

The following list gives the ways a cockatrice or chickatrice can kill you, and what there is to be done about it. (Except where otherwise stated, "cockatrice" will refer to both cockatrices and chickatrices.) This list may not be exhaustive.  All methods are instantly fatal and assume you are not stoning-resistant, unless noted. Wearing an [[amulet of life saving]] will save you if you are petrified.

===Petrification by a corpse===

====Always petrifies====
* Get hit by a monster wielding it (delayed death).{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|995|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/mhitu.c|1252|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} If you've killed a cockatrice near an enemy that can wield weapons, there is a high chance that one wearing gloves will pick up the corpse and attempt to stone you with it. Be on alert for messages involving the corpse being wielded. If you are blind and cannot see this information, it is best to assume they have wielded it. If an enemy has the corpse and you cannot kill it, you are advised to make your way to another level and wait for the corpse to rot away, which will take place in 250 turns. If a moat is nearby and you are wearing boots, you can kick the corpse into the water to make it inaccessible.
* Eat it. Gaining the [[food appraisal]] intrinsic warns you before eating dangerous food, including food that will petrify you. ('This smells like it could be something very dangerous!') The intrinsic is gained by reading a blessed [[scroll of food detection]], or casting 'detect food' at skilled or expert in divination spells. It lasts for one warning. If you have stoning resistance, it will give you a message 'This tastes just like chicken!' Keep food (especially cockatrice corpses) out of slot 'y'; this will help avoid accidentally eating something you shouldn't.

====Without wearing gloves====
* Pick it up. If you are polymorphed into a creature that lacks hands and can pick up objects, you will also be stoned.
* Put it into or take it out of a [[container]].
* Try to throw or fire it.
* Wield the corpse.
* Snag it with a [[bullwhip]] or [[grappling hook]]. However, simply picking up the corpse with a [[bullwhip]] is fine.{{refsrc|src/pickup.c|256|version=NetHack 3.6.6|comment=apply.c does not call the usual check when using the whip to pick up the corpse off the ground, but does call it when a weaponized corpse is snatched.}}{{refsrc|src/apply.c|2714|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/apply.c|2849|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}
* Steal it (for example, when polymorphed into a [[nymph]]).
* [[Sacrifice]] it. This even happens when it's already lying on the [[altar]].
* [[Tin]] the corpse.

====Without wearing gloves, [[blind]]ed====
* Feeling the corpse when you move or teleport onto the square containing the corpse when not using {{kbd|m}}.
* Cease [[levitation|levitating]] over it when not using {{kbd|m}}.
* Look (using ':' at the square containing it).
* Get expelled from an engulfing monster on a square containing the corpse when not using {{kbd|m}}.

====Without wearing a [[helm]]====
* Throw it upwards (direction {{kbd|<}}). The death message is "petrified by elementary physics" (what goes up, must come down).

====Without wearing [[boots]]====
* [[Kick]] it.
* Trip over it while [[fumbling]], as of [[NetHack 3.6.0]].

====Wearing gloves while wielding the corpse as a weapon====
* Fall down the stairs. This happens if you are [[burdened]] or worse, are [[fumbling]], or are [[punished]]. However, you will never fall down the stairs if you are [[flying]].
* Fall down a pit, hole or a trapdoor, including jumping into them while [[flying]].
* Fall into a chasm created by a [[drum of earthquake]].
* Fall into a pit created by stepping on a [[landmine]]. If you are flying or levitating, you can pass over these without falling (except in [[Sokoban]]). Flying won't stop you from triggering the landmine, but it will prevent you from falling into the created pit. Jumping down a hole or trapdoor while flying ''will'' stone you.
* Fall onto a [[sink]] while levitating.
* Faint from hunger and fall on the corpse.
* Lose your gloves to disintegration by a [[scroll of destroy armor]].
* Lose your gloves to overenchantment (or underenchantment) by a [[scroll of enchant armor]]. If the enchantment on the gloves is +4 or higher, reading a non-cursed scroll of enchant armor may destroy them. If the enchantment is &minus;4 or lower, reading a cursed scroll of enchant armor may do the same.
* Lose your gloves to the monster spell destroy armor. [[Magic resistance]] protects you from this spell.
* Have your gloves taken off by a [[foocubus]]. You have {{frac|[[charisma]]|20}} chance of having the option to stop a foocubus from removing an item of armor. Cancelling them stops the seduction attacks altogether. Nymphs and [[monkey]]s cannot steal your gloves if you're holding a weapon; they will try to take your weapon first, petrifying themselves if successful. The corpse can be retrieved by breaking the resulting statue.

====Without wearing gloves, wielding the corpse while stoning-resistant====
* Change to a non-stoning-resistant form. [[Polymorph control]] or [[unchanging]] can prevent this. Reaching zero [[HP]] will change you back to your normal, non-resistant form if you don't have [[unchanging]], and kill you if you do.

===Petrification by a living cockatrice===
* Attack (strike, touch, or claw) it with bare, ungloved hands.
** Due to a bug, even the {{kbd|m}} command will not be safe if the cockatrice is shown only as a [[warning]] symbol.<!--Which version?-->
* Attack it with ungloved hands, wielding a [[potion]].
* Kick it without wearing boots (as a monster attack or as a command).
* Bite or sting it (monster attack).
* Headbutt it without wearing a helmet (monster attack).
* Hug it without gloves and a cloak (monster attack).
* Suck its brain with tentacles (as [[mind flayer]] or master mind flayer).
* Attack it while polymorphed into a [[foocubus]] ("You smile at the cockatrice seductively. You turn to stone...").
* Swallow it whole (as [[trapper]], [[lurker above]], or [[purple worm]]).
* Without gloves, attempt to saddle it.
* Without gloves, attempt to untrap it from a pit.
* Hear its hissing (delayed death). See {{sa|Hissing attack|sectionsign=true}} for details.
* [[Riding|Ride]] an animal that steps on a [[polymorph trap]] and turns into a cockatrice. Your [[magic resistance]] protects ridden monsters against polytraps.
* Get reduced to zero HP by its attacks. This will kill you normally, but if you weren't petrification resistant, you will leave a statue instead of a ghost in your [[bones]] file. If you were polymorphed into a stoning-resistant form while wearing an amulet of unchanging, you leave a ghost instead.

If you have no weapon or gloves, or are polymorphed into a form which has an unusual attack, cockatrices should not be directly attacked; attack them with ranged weapons or spells. If you suck a cockatrice's brain, you turn to stone. If your life is saved, you still suffer the delayed death stoning effects. [[Minotaur]]s are the only headbutters capable of wearing helmets (and even then, only cloth and leather hats). [[Salamander]]s are the only huggers capable of wearing both gloves and a cloak.

===Other ways to be petrified by a cockatrice===
* Eat a [[tin]] of cockatrice meat.
* Eat a [[cockatrice egg]] (delayed death).
* Get hit by a cockatrice egg thrown by a monster (delayed death).
* Without a helmet, throw a cockatrice egg in the air (direction {{kbd|<}}; ''not'' a delayed death).
* Without gloves, smash a [[potion of polymorph]] over a monster, turning it into a cockatrice. (This is [[Bugs in NetHack 3.4.3#C343-31|bug #C343-31]], fixed May 2004)

== Use as a weapon ==

A cockatrice corpse is an extremely powerful weapon, but can easily backfire and thus should be used with some caution.  To avoid falling in an unknown [[pit]], you should unwield it or be levitating when moving around in places that might have traps. Even if you are levitating and not fumbling (highly recommended), you should stay away from sinks, nymphs and foocubi to be perfectly safe. (But 20 Charisma makes foocubi safe.) Some creatures are immune to [[stoning]], and [[golem]]s turn into powerful [[stone golem]]s that can easily annihilate a character in the early game. So have a different weapon ready to use, and never stone a golem in the early game.

Due to a minor [[bug#jabberwock|bug]], players polymorphed into a [[jabberwock]] will not stone monsters with a wielded cockatrice corpse.<ref>The exact condition for stoning a monster with a wielded trice corpse seems to be: (in natural form or (hit with weapon attack or hit with claw attack in slot 1 or hit with claw attack in slot 2 as a foocubus or hit with any attack in slot 1 as any L)). This also excludes some monster that cannot wield a weapon (adult [[dragon]], [[raven]], [[crocodile]], and the invalid polyforms [[Ixoth]], [[Demogorgon]], and the [[Chromatic Dragon]]).</ref>

== History ==

Before [[Hack 1.0.3]], a successful hissing attack was an [[instadeath]]; the only safe way to fight a cockatrice was with ranged weapons.  The effect of the new moon first appeared in [[Hack 1.0.2]].

== Wishing ==

Wishing for footrice corpses can sometimes be a good idea when fighting tough monsters or a multitude of them. A good [[Astral Plane]] wish would be a blessed partly eaten chickatrice corpse&mdash;chickatrice corpses are lighter than cockatrices, and partly eaten ones are lighter still. All [[Quest nemesis|Quest nemeses]] and the endgame [[rider]]s are stoning resistant.

Here is a quick list of monsters that can be good candidates for stoning.
* Moloch's [[Aligned priest|priest]]s and the [[high priest]] (especially in [[Moloch's Sanctum]] and the Astral Plane)
* [[Demon princes]] and lords (except [[Juiblex]], who is stone resistant)
* The [[Wizard of Yendor]]
* [[Angel]]ic beings, including [[Archon]]s
* [[Mind flayer]]s
* [[Lich]]es

It's always a good idea to save up a couple of extra charges on your [[wand of wishing]] just in case. You never know when [[Demogorgon]] shows up or five [[Archon]]s are generated on the [[Plane of Fire]].

== Resistances conveyed ==

According to definition in monst.c, eating footrice should convey [[stoning resistance]], but this is [[Deferred features|not implemented]].{{refsrc|src/monst.c|178|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/monst.c|184|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Origin==

The cockatrice is alleged to be incubated by a serpent or toad from a rooster's egg. Yolkless eggs were traditionally believed to have been laid by roosters.

Physically, it resembles a rooster with a reptilian tail and bat wings.

The traditional cockatrice is simply deadly. The stoning attack property comes from ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

The cockatrice is closely related to the [[basilisk]] (a monster not present in vanilla NetHack) referred to in the encyclopedia entry. The relation between basilisks and cockatrices is unclear; sometimes they are used as synonyms, but other times a basilisk is a different monster.

== Encyclopedia entry ==

{{encyclopedia|
Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are
just right, a seven-year-old rooster will lay an egg.  Then,
along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to 
hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation 
to wither.

There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows
why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to
sicken and die.

This usually happens due to an encounter with a [[cockatrice]], but the gaze of [[Medusa]] also turns you to stone.

Stoning [[resistance]] can only be gained by [[polymorphing]] into an [[intrinsic]]ally stoning-resistant monster, and is not available by any other means (such as equipment or eating corpses). You are only resistant for the duration you are such a monster. Intrinsic [[stoning resistance]] is [[Deferred features|not implemented]].<ref>{{sourcecode|monst.c|147}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|184}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|176}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|426}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|433}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|1349}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|1423}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|1744}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|1774}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|2063}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|2477}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|2879}}, {{sourcecode|monst.c|3220}}</ref>

==Stoning resistance==
While '''stoning resistance''' is a [[property]] that can occur in-game, it can generally only be obtained by polymorphing into the form of a stoning-resistant monster.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|As of {{commit|071d79dce2ad5b8ade17c4dedf6b57c18b273a59}}, ''temporary'' stoning resistance can be granted by eating the following corpses:
[[acid blob]], [[chickatrice]], [[cockatrice]], [[gargoyle]], [[winged gargoyle]], [[spotted jelly]], [[ochre jelly]], [[yellow dragon]], [[green mold]], [[black naga]], [[green slime]], [[xorn]], [[Medusa]], [[lizard]], [[Chromatic Dragon]].

You get the message '''You feel less concerned about becoming petrified.''' when you gain temporary stoning resistance and '''You no longer feel secure from petrification.''' when the temporary resistance expires.

You can get extrinsic stoning resistance by wearing [[yellow dragon scales]] or [[yellow dragon scale mail]].}}

===Stoning-resistant monsters===
A variety of monsters are stoning-resistant, typically for fairly straightforward reasons:<ref>See {{sourcecode|monst.c|94}} and on; look for MR_STONE in the seventh field (not the eighth, that's resistances it grants).</ref>

* Creatures that can petrify others: [[chickatrice]]s, [[cockatrice]]s, and [[Medusa]] (but Medusa can be stoned by her own reflection)
* Creatures already made of stone or earth: [[gargoyle]]s, [[winged gargoyle]]s, [[stone golem]]s, [[earth elemental]]s, [[xorn]]s
* Creatures that are acidic: [[acid blob]]s, [[black naga hatchling]]s, [[black naga]]s, [[gelatinous cube]]s, [[green mold]]s, [[Juiblex]], [[ochre jelly|ochre jellies]], [[spotted jelly|spotted jellies]], [[baby yellow dragon]]s, [[yellow dragon]]s, all {{mcsl|P}}
* Immaterial creatures: [[air elemental]]s, [[djinni|djinn]], [[sandestin]]s, [[mail daemon]]s, [[fire elemental]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[shade]]s, [[water elemental]]s, [[wraith]]s, [[light (monster class)|light]]s, all {{mcsl|v}}
* Important enemies: [[Death (monster)|Death]], [[Famine]], [[Pestilence]], and all [[quest nemesis|quest nemeses]]
* [[Lizard]]s (logically enough, since they cure stoning when eaten)
* [[Skeleton]]s (presumably fossilization doesn't slow them down much)
* Other [[golem]]s are not stoning resistant, but instead become stone golems if they would be stoned by any method.

==Stiffening versus instadeath==
Touching a cockatrice or chickatrice is instantly fatal for a character without stoning resistance, as is meeting the gaze of Medusa. Attacking a cockatrice or chickatrice barehanded or barefooted, picking up the corpse barehanded, and kicking it barefooted are ways of touching among many, many others. Throwing a cockatrice egg up ({{kbd|<}}) and being hit by it is an instadeath, but being hit by one thrown by a monster starts the stiffening process, as does eating the egg, or hearing the cockatrice's hissing attack. The process technically takes 5 turns, but after 2, your limbs turn to stone and you can't do anything else but proceed to die. You will also lose any intrinsic speed when you start "slowing down",{{refsrc|timeout.c|36}} which may give you even fewer actions to save yourself; if you are [[burdened]] or worse, you might not be able to save yourself at all!

==Stopping stiffening==
If you hear the hissing of a cockatrice and start turning to stone &ndash; stiffening &ndash; you still have several ways, albeit not several turns, to save yourself. The corpse of a [[lizard]] or an acidic monster stops the process as soon as you start eating, so you shouldn't worry about not chewing fast enough or being [[interrupt]]ed. The monster corpses that can stop stiffening are as follows:<ref>{{sourcecode|src/eat.c|704|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}, {{sourcecode|src/eat.c|733|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}</ref>

* [[lizard]]
* (baby) [[yellow dragon]]
* [[black naga]] (hatchling)
* [[acid blob]]
* [[gelatinous cube]]
* [[spotted jelly]]
* [[ochre jelly]]
* [[green mold]]
* [[gray ooze]]
* [[brown pudding]]
* [[black pudding]]
* [[green slime]] â€“ but see below.

[[Tin]]s of the above monsters will also work. However, you need a [[blessed]] [[tin opener]] (which always immediately opens tins) in order to guarantee opening the tin in time.  If you do not have a blessed tin opener, a blessed tin will open in 0-1 turns, but if it takes 1 turn, you may be interrupted while opening it.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1469|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}  [[Apply]]ing a tin opener will wield it without taking a turn if you then immediately open a tin.

The most common method is to eat a lizard corpse; since they never rot, you should always carry one along.

However, if you do not have an appropriate corpse with you, you may also quaff a [[potion of acid]]. The {{spell of|stone to flesh}} spell will save you if you cast it on yourself, but it will also turn [[mineral]] items in your main inventory to meat, including rocks, [[ring]]s, and [[wand]]s.

If your [[god]] is happy with you and you are not in [[Gehennom]], [[prayer]] works as well.

[[Sliming]] only saves you from petrification if it is from eating a [[glob]] of [[green slime]], which is acidic; however, it is then necessary to cure the sliming.

An [[amulet of unchanging]] will ''not'' protect you from stoning, but an [[amulet of life saving]] will save your life. [[Reflection]] or [[blindness]] protects you from turning to stone by the gaze of [[Medusa]]. Wearing gloves is strongly recommended while handling cockatrices.

[[Polymorphing]] into a stoning-resistant monster will also stop the petrification process, as will polymorphing into any type of golem (as they turn into stone golems rather than dying).

==Variants==

=== SLASH'EM ===
In [[SLASH'EM]], there are two additional monsters that cause stoning: the thick-hided [[basilisk]], and the [[asphynx]], which can hide under objects and stone an unsuspecting player. Both are significantly higher-level than the cockatrice; on average, fights against them will be longer, increasing the chance that one of their attacks may start turning you to stone. They also use different glyphs, meaning that a blessed scroll of genocide is no longer an easy solution.

SLASH'EM also introduces the [[amulet versus stone]], which will save your life against stoning in the same manner as an [[amulet of life saving]], costing a point of constitution and incrementing the "killed" counter. The amulet, however, is not destroyed in the process unless it is cursed; otherwise, its [[beatitude]] changes from uncursed to cursed, or from blessed to uncursed. Thus, with a sufficient supply of [[holy water]], one amulet can prevent many stoning [[YASD]]s.

===UnNetHack===

In [[UnNetHack]], external resistance to stoning may be provided by [[chromatic dragon scales]] (or [[chromatic dragon scale mail]]).

===dNetHack===

[[dNetHack]] introduces several new acidic monsters, whose corpses can cure stoning: 

*[[shoggoth]]s
*[[blood bloater]]s
*blue and yellow [[dragon]]s and baby forms (blue is new)
*[[flux slime]]
*[[darkness given hunger]]

In addition, all varieties of [[cave lizard]] and [[giant turtle]]s will cure stoning.

[[Monk]]s gain intrinsic stoning resistance at level 27.

===FIQHack===

In [[FIQHack]], external resistance to stoning is provided by [[yellow dragon scales]] (or [[yellow dragon scale mail]]), in addition to the usual acid resistance.

==History==
In old versions of ''NetHack'', as in ''[[Hack]]'', the {{kbd|Shift|Q}} command would quit. However, this command was rarely used, so newer versions changed {{kbd|Shift|Q}} to [[quiver]] and introduced the extended command "#quit".

{{otheruses|the role|the monster|aligned priest}}

'''Priest''' ('''priestess''' if female) is one of the [[role]]s in NetHack, capable of playing any [[alignment]] as a [[human (starting race)|human]], or restricted to chaotic as an [[elf (starting race)|elf]]. A priest's religion is chosen randomly from the [[pantheon]]s of the other roles. A human priest is therefore capable of representing any of the other roles' [[god]]s in the game.

The [[guidebook]] has this to say about Priests.

     Priests and Priestesses are clerics militant, crusaders advancing the cause of  righteousness with arms, armor, and arts thaumaturgic. Their ability to commune with deities via prayer occasionally extricates them from peril, but can also put them in it.

==Starting equipment==
Priests start with the following items:
* a [[blessed]] +1 [[mace]]
* a +0 [[robe]]
* a +0 [[small shield]] (like those of [[aligned priest]]s)
* 1&ndash;2 cloves of [[garlic]]
* 1&ndash;2 [[sprig of wolfsbane|sprigs of wolfsbane]]
* 2 random [[spellbook]]s of level 3 or lower (suitable for priests: [[clerical]], [[divination]], or [[healing spells]])
* 4 potions of [[holy water]]
* a chance at one of the following:
** an [[oil lamp]] (9% chance)
** a [[magic marker]] (10% chance)
* If an elf, a random non-magical [[instrument]].

==Intrinsics==
Priests gain the following [[intrinsic]]s at these [[experience level]]s:{{refsrc|attrib.c|62}}
* Level 15: [[Warning]]
* Level 20: [[Fire resistance]]

==Skills==
{{Priest skill table}}
Priests start with ''Basic'' skill in ''Mace'' and ''Clerical spells''. The spellcasting skill is always ''Clerical'', no matter what spellbooks a character starts with, because the initial spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function ''skill_init'' in [[Source:NetHack 3.4.3/src/weapon.c|weapon.c]] and are independent of the starting inventory. Their special spell is {{of|spell|remove curse}}.

==Special rules==
Priests automatically know the [[beatitude]] of all [[item]]s. This doesn't require sight or touch -- any item you're aware of, for any reason, will show its beatitude. If no [[BUC]] is shown, that means the item is uncursed. (You can force the game to include the "uncursed" descriptor by setting <code>!implicit_uncursed</code> in your [[options]].)

Priests don't receive the [[multishot]] bonus for their [[race]] or being Skilled at their weapon; thus, they can never fire more than one missile per move.

As the guidebook (somewhat obtusely) alludes to, Priests can also #[[turn undead]].

==Strategy==
===Character creation===
Priests are restricted in most edged weapons, including many desirable weapon skills, and players may elect to work around this by means of a [[sacrifice gift]]. For such players, lawful priests have the best chance of receiving a viable [[artifact weapon]] in the form of an artifact [[long sword]] such as [[Sunsword]] or even [[Grayswandir]], with the unrestricted skill making [[Excalibur]] an option as well. Neutral priests have somewhat less reliable options for a first gift, though they may receive [[Mjolnir]], which is a quite powerful artifact in its own right and can be advanced to Expert skill. While most chaotic options for first sacrifice gift options are somewhat useless, elven Priests can force [[Stormbringer]] by naming [[Sting]] and [[Orcrist]] beforehand.

For those not planning to use an artifact weapon, priests in general can be quite fragile in the early game unless they elect to wear armor. Lawful priests have the least perilous trip through the [[Mines]] early on, while chaotic priests gain more "immediate" benefits from [[sacrifice]] due to prayer timeout reduction, which can aid in farming [[spellbook]]s; chaotic priests will also have an easier time dealing with the [[mysterious force]].

Elven Priests tend to be the most fragile of all available choices, and need assistance from equipment to reach the maximum [[strength]] damage bonus or even maximum [[encumbrance|carrying capacity]]. Their higher maximum [[attribute]]s for casting stats may not make as much difference in [[spellcasting]] success by the time you can actually reach those limits, although the [[energy]] growth bonus is somewhat helpful.

===Early game===
====Weapons====
One disadvantage of the Priest is their weapon skill set. Priests can't gain [[Skill#Weapon_skills|skill]] in any edged weapons, and can't [[Multishot#Eligible_missiles|multishot]] any ranged weapons. Combined with no skill in the [[Spellbook#Attack|attack spells]], this makes it hard for priests to find a good way to kill monsters.

Instead, a Priest's best ranged option early game is the [[aklys]], which they can pick up in the mines and can advance to up to Expert. Skill and enchantment investments on the aklys can be useful for the entire game.

The starting +1 [[mace]] is slightly better than a +0 long sword at Basic skill against small monsters. It is much less effective against large monsters, but these typically appear later. Priests can use a [[unicorn horn]] to do more damage to large monsters.  Like any character, a Priest will want to sacrifice for an artifact weapon as soon as possible.  Lawful priests should generally dip for [[Excalibur]] as soon as they can survive any fountain spawns.  Even unskilled, Excalibur is better than other available options.

====Armor====
Metallic armor and [[shield]]s are worth wearing to get your AC down; your starting spells don't generally need to be cast quickly, so when you do need to cast them you can find a quiet spot and disrobe. You will want to switch to non-metallic armor with a good AC as it becomes available.

====Spellcasting====
A priest starts with a [[robe]] which aids spellcasting, and can use their potions of holy water to bless spellbooks they find, thus gaining more spells. However, they may have better uses for holy water.

A priest should focus on melee combat because most of their starting spells aren't useful in a fight. However, they are very capable of casting low-level spells such as [[Spellbook of sleep|sleep]] and [[Spellbook of force bolt|force bolt]].

The most useful combat spells that a priest can start with are [[Spellbook of protection|protection]] and [[Spellbook of healing|healing]]. Utility spells, especially [[Spellbook of identify|identify]], can also give a priest a significant advantage once they are able to cast them.

====General====
Priests' ability to tell the beatitude of items and their starting holy water gives them advantages in the early game:
* They can identify which weapons, armor, and rings are safe to equip even if they have lost their pet. Another character who cannot [[curse-testing|pet-test]] must drag everything to an altar.
* They can more easily get the more useful blessed effects of scrolls such as identify, genocide, enchant armor, and enchant weapon.
* They can remove curses with holy water or by blessing [[scroll of remove curse|scrolls of remove curse]].
* They can get an early wish if they find a [[magic lamp]]; they may wish to go to [[Mine Town]] early to see if there is one to buy.
* Priests can easily uncurse items they find in [[bones file]]s.

Consider stashing at least one of your starting potions of holy water as early as possible, to keep from losing it to cold/fire/lightning attacks.  As long as you have one potion, you can make more at will.

If you manage to get an early wish, dragon scale mail is generally more useful than a weapon, because AC and non-metallic body armor are useful things for a priest to have.

You should [[turn undead|#turn]] undead only if you are certain that there are no non-[[undead]] monsters nearby.

=====Atheist conduct=====
Priests are well suited to the [[atheist]] conduct, because they need not use altars to ascertain beatitude.

Lycanthropy can be dealt with using your starting wolfsbane. Removing curses is easy with the starting holy water.

Using #turn will break atheist conduct, as will using #chat on a priest (monster).

===Mid game===
====Objectives====
The quest has mostly weaker [[zombie]]s and only a few strong monsters, and the large number of graveyards contain many boxes full of items. There is more treasure on this quest than any other. [[Drain resistance]] or at least [[magic cancellation]] of 3 is useful to prevent [[Drain life (monster attack)|level drain]] from [[Wraith (monster class)|wraiths]] and [[Vampire (monster class)|vampires]]. If you are not at a high enough level for the Quest but have access to [[create monster]] in some form, you can gain levels by creating wraiths on the home level and luring them back through the portal.

The unaligned altar can be converted and used for sacrificing, but monster generation is low and most generated monsters are undead and cannot be sacrificed.  In version 3.6.0 and later, you can get corpses by [[kicking]] the [[tree]]s on the home level to summon [[killer bee]]s.  

Some priests that get to the Castle will be strong enough to face the monsters in direct combat, or use the [[passtune]] to crush more difficult monsters with the drawbridge.

====Spellcasting====
Except for attack spells, Priests are decent spell-casters. They can advance to expert in clerical, divination and healing, but are restricted in other classes. Note that their spellcasting prowess is based on Wisdom, not Intelligence (but the odds of learning a new spell still depend on Intelligence). Even with attack spells restricted, the simpler ones (i.e., level 3 and below) may still be of use.

Skill slots are not in short supply; a Priest has few weapon skills, and may gain many levels from wraith corpses in the [[quest]]. Advancing divinations to Skilled enhances the effects of spells like {{spell of | detect monsters}}, {{Spell of|detect treasure}}, and identify, but advancing the school to Expert only improves spell failure rates.

===Late game===
====Spellcasting====
A high level priest may be able to make use of a [[spellbook of polymorph]], despite having no skill in matter spells, by using the [[Mitre of Holiness]] and a robe.

At skilled divination, Priests should be able to cast {{of|Spellbook|magic mapping}}, which should make [[Gehennom mapping]] a trivial task.

You can learn simple attack spells (like [[force bolt]] or {{of|Spellbook|drain life}}) and cast them with 0% failure rate.  [[Magic missile]] is especially useful at high levels, as its damage scales up with your level - which can easily be increased due to the wraiths in the quest.

==Rank titles==

The [[status line]] shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:

*XL 1&ndash;2: Aspirant
*XL 3&ndash;5: Acolyte
*XL 6&ndash;9: Adept
*XL 10&ndash;13: Priest/Priestess
*XL 14&ndash;17: Curate
*XL 18&ndash;21: Canon/Canoness
*XL 22&ndash;25: Lama
*XL 26&ndash;29: Patriarch/Matriarch
*XL 30: High Priest/High Priestess

==Quest==
{{main|Priest quest}}

[[Nalzok]], the Priest [[quest nemesis]], is quite tough, but he respects [[Elbereth]] and the [[scroll of scare monster]]. The quest is rather boring, but extremely profitable. All the levels contain several graveyards with [[wraith]]s and chests full of goodies. The locate level may also contain several sleeping [[foocubi]], which you should not disturb until you are able to utilize them without the risk of negative effects. Given all the graveyards and sleeping monsters, some source of [[stealth]] is advisable before attempting this quest.

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|The scroll of scare monster on the ground no longer scares any [[unique]] monster.}}

The quest artifact is [[The Mitre of Holiness]], which has a great base item in the [[helm of brilliance]]; the Mitre additionally allows you to #[[invoke]] it to regain your [[power]], gives [[fire resistance]] and halves damage from the [[undead]] and most [[demons]]. However, unlike many quest artifacts, it doesn't confer [[magic resistance]], so you have to get that from a different source.
