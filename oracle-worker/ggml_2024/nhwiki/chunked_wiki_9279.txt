|Adult [[dragon]]s (various)
|
* [[Black dragon]]s have a powerful [[disintegration]] breath attack which can instantly kill any foe, including extremely tough baddies such as [[Master Kaen]] and [[Demogorgon]].
* [[Silver dragon]] is arguably the best general-purpose fighting dragon form due to its intrinsic [[reflection]].
* [[Gray dragon]]s have [[magic resistance]], but the benefits are lessened since polymorph traps are no longer a dangerous threat (due to you having polymorph control). It is possible albeit difficult to create [[silver dragon scale mail|silver]] or [[gray dragon scale mail]] by polymorphing into one of these forms. Unless you are a female character initially, you'll have to polymorph repeatedly until you turn into a female form of the dragon, and then #sit to produce eggs. Raise the pet baby dragons until they turn into adults, and then have them killed. They might leave [[dragon scales]], which can be turned into [[dragon scale mail]] using a [[scroll of enchant armor]].
* If you lack [[poison resistance]], you can easily gain it by polymorphing into a [[green dragon]] and eating [[poison]]ous corpses. Although the green dragon is poison resistant, you can still permanently gain the intrinsic by eating poisonous corpses ("''You feel especially healthy''").
* If already wearing dragon scales or mail, you become that dragon.

==SLASH'EM==
In [[SLASH'EM]], polymorph control is an intrinsic which is given to a [[doppelganger (starting race)|doppelganger]] at level 9. For this reason, doppelgangers are an excellent race choice for newer players, as polymorph control makes them extremely powerful relatively early in the game.

Furthermore, the number of attractive polymorph targets in SLASH'EM is significantly higher. Some worthwhile forms (in addition to those listed above):

* [[Giant shoggoth]]s are about the most powerful form, making short work of just about any monster, including [[Black market (SLASH'EM)#One-eyed Sam|One-eyed Sam]]. They are stoning resistant, can eat metal, are quite fast, and have teleport control. Unfortunately, they are also blind and have no hands. Thus, they make poor traveling forms, but are excellent for problem-solving.
* [[Crystal golem]]s are too large to wear body armor, but intrinsically possess magic resistance, reflection, fire, cold, sleep and shock resistance. They will always have 300 HP as well. While their melee attack only does the damage of your wielded weapon/bare-handed combat abilities, they also possess a random breath weapon, possibly including disintegration.
* [[Master mind flayer]]s are still a good choice, but in SLASH'EM they oddly have fewer brain-eating attacks than normal mind flayers.
* [[Fire vampire]]s and [[star vampire]]s are [[breathless]], [[regenerate|regenerating]], [[flying]], and make excellent fighting forms. Fire vampires can wear all types of armor, give out radius 2 [[light]], have 24 speed, a base level of 12 (same as a [[vampire lord]]), a base AC of 0, and additional attacks including a fire touch and level-draining bite. Star vampires can wear all types of armor excluding body armor (shirt, suit/robe, cloak), have 18 speed, base AC of &minus;5, a base level of 18, and can easily mow down enemies, doing up to 12d6 damage with six tentacle attacks per turn. Note that if you are playing the [[Vampire_(starting_race_in_SLASH%27EM)|vampire race]], any attempt to transform into any vampiric form will always result in failure, with the "You feel like a new (wo)man!" message and its attendant effects.
* [[Gug]]s can wear all regular things, and have a paralyzing attack and 18 speed.

Note that in SLASH'EM, forms that have a contact attack (bite, tentacle, claw, touch, etc.) will refrain from using that contact attack against a monster with a passive [[stoning]] attack ([[cockatrice]], [[chickatrice]], [[basilisk]], or [[asphynx]]), but you still need to exercise caution. Contact attacks will be disabled ''only'' if: (1) you attack with a wielded weapon, and (2) the monster is in the same form for the first attack and subsequent attacks. Thus, clawing, biting, or butting a cockatrice without wielding a weapon will stone you, but hitting one with a sword as a master mind flayer or vampire will not; that is, unless the cockatrice was polymorphed into (for example) a troll, and an early attack caused the troll to drop below 1 hp and revert to cockatrice form, in which case the subsequent attacks will still hit the cockatrice and result in a stoning instadeath. This latter case may be a bug. Note further that this limits polyself options for doppleganger monks who are attempting the weaponless conduct; they will always attempt their contact attacks.

'''도끼'''는 [[NetHack|넷핵]]에서 찾아볼 수 있는 [[melee|근접]] [[weapon|무기]]의 일종입니다. 도끼는 [[thrown|던지거나]] 도구로써 [[applied|사용]]할 수도 있습니다.

==생성==
도끼는 무작위로 생성되는 무기들([[death drop]]처럼 바닥 위거나, [[shop|상점]] 안) 중에서 4%를 차지합니다. 

[[Barbarian|야만인]]은 50%의 확률로 도끼를 부 무기로 든 채 시작합니다.{{refsrc|src/u_init.c|673|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

게다가, [[dwarves|드워프]]{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|329|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}와 [[ninja|닌자]]{{refsrc|src/makemon.c|272|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}는 일정 확률로 도끼를 가지고 생성됩니다.

== 효과 ==
도끼는 [[wood golem|나무 골렘]]에게 추가로 d4의 피해를 줍니다.{{refsrc|src/weapon.c|327|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

만약 당신이 쥐고 있는 무기가 도끼라면, 당신은 축복받지 않은 [[tin|통조림]]을 6턴 만에 열 수 있습니다.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1440|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

=== 사용하기 ===
도끼(와 전투도끼)는 지정한 방향으로 [[door|문]]이나 [[tree|나무]]를 내려찍는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 도끼로 내려찍는 과정은 [[pick-axe|곡괭이]]나 [[dwarvish mattock|드워프제 곡괭이]]로 [[dig|파는 것]]과 비슷합니다. 도끼를 문에다 사용하는 것은 걷어차는 것보다 안전한 방법인데, 왜냐하면 도끼는 절대 [[shop|상점]] 문을 부수지 않을 것이기 때문입니다. ("This door seems too hard to chop through. (이 문은 내려찍기에는 너무 단단해 보인다.) ") 이것은 당신이 파손 비용으로 400 [[zorkmid|조크미드]]를 아낄 수 있게 해줍니다.

나무를 내려찍으면 20%의 확률로 무작위 [[fruit|과일]]을 얻게 됩니다. (나무를 [[kick|걷어차서]] 과일을 이미 얻었다고 해도 말입니다) {{refsrc|src/dig.c|400|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} 이것을 [[Minetown|광산촌]]의 [[watchman|경비]] 시야 내에서 할 경우 그를 화나게 만들 것입니다. ("Halt, vandal! You're under arrest! (멈춰라, 파괴자! 너를 체포하겠다!) ")

== 도끼 기술 ==
{{axe skill table}}

도끼의 "큰형" 격인 [[battle-axe|전투도끼]]는, 동일한 [[skill|기술]]을 사용하지만 소형에서 대형 몬스터까지는 비교적으로 피해를 더 주지만, 더 무겁고 [[two-handed|양손무기]]라는 단점이 있습니다.

원판에서는 전투도끼 [[Cleaver|클리버]]만이 이 기술을 사용하는 유일한 [[artifact weapon|유물 무기]]입니다.

==변형판==
[[SLASH'EM|슬래시엠]]에서는, 유물 [[long sword|장검]] [[Giantslayer|자이언트슬레이어]]가 유물 도끼인 [[Giantkiller|자이언트킬러]]로 교체되었습니다.

== 백과사전 항목 ==

'''시체'''란 죽은 [[monster|몬스터]]의 시체를 가리킵니다. 이것은 매우 흔한 [[comestible|식료품]]입니다. 일부 몬스터는 절대 시체를 떨어뜨리지 않으며, 일부는 간혹, 일부는 특별한 상황을 제외하고는 항상 시체를 떨어뜨릴 것입니다.

비록 모든 시체가 식료품으로 분류되긴 하지만, 그렇다고 모든 시체가 먹어도 된다는 뜻은 아닙니다. 일부 시체는 [[acid|산성]]이거나 [[poison|독성]] 또는 [[hallucination|환각]]을 유발합니다; 일부 시체는 당신이 원치 않는 특성을 줄 것이며; 심하게는 먹으면 치명적인 것들도 있습니다. 일반적으로, 당신은 적절한 저항이나, 이들이 일으키는 상태를 치유할 수단이 있기 전까지는 이 시체들을 피해야 합니다. 어느 시체를 피해야 하는지 배우는 방법 중 하나는 당신의 애완동물이 시체를 먹는지 보는 것입니다; 예를 들어, 애완동물은 절대로 독성 시체를 먹지 않을 것입니다 (애완동물이 독 저항을 가지지 않았다면 말입니다). 하지만, 여기에는 몇 가지 예외사항이 있습니다; 예를 들어, 길들여진 애완동물은 고양이, 개, 박쥐, 자색 곰팡이, 레프리콘, 님프, 스토커, 텐구, 그리고 당신의 종족의 시체를 부작용 없이 먹을 것이며, 당신은 이들의 부정적인 효과를 처리할 방법이 있기 전까지는 이 시체들을 피해야 합니다.

대부분의 시체들은 [[undead turning|사자소생]]의 지팡이나 주문으로 [[revive|되살릴]] 수 있으며, 일부는 자연적으로 되살아납니다.

==시체 생성의 예외 사례odds==
대부분의 몬스터들은 죽을 때 항상 시체를 남기진 않습니다. 보통 죽었을 때 시체를 남기는 몬스터들은 [[stoning|석화]], [[disintegration|분해]], 또는 [[digestion|소화]]로 죽었을 때에는 절대 시체를 남기지 않습니다. [[ghost|유령]]이나 [[yellow light|노란 빛]]과 같은 몬스터들은 절대로 [[Corpseless|시체를 남기지 않을 것입니다]]. [[Lizard]]s and any monster that is larger than [[size]] Medium are guaranteed to leave a corpse when killed by normal means unless they were produced by cloning, and [[player monster]]s and the [[Riders]] will always leave a corpse; in particular, this means that [[troll]]s, whose corpses can be very annoying, will normally always leave a corpse. [[Golem]]s are guaranteed to leave their special death drops (if applicable) when killed.
As of [[3.6.1]], [[shopkeeper]]s also always leave a corpse.{{refsrc|mon.c|2020|version=NetHack 3.6.1}}

For all other monsters, there is a 1 in ''n'' chance that the monster will leave a corpse when killed, where ''n'' is generated as follows:{{refsrc|src/mon.c|1923|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
*''n'' starts with a value of 2
*Add 1 if the monster is size Tiny
*Add 1 if the monster's generation frequency is "Very Rare", "Not randomly generated" or "Unique".

Monsters will never leave a corpse on the [[Rogue level]]. Undead on a [[Special room#Graveyard|graveyard]] level have 1/9 of the normal chance of leaving a corpse if killed by you, or 1/3 of the normal chance if killed by anything else, further reducing the above odds.

(In a similar vein, some monster types will get replaced when you bring them back to life, e. g. priest corpses become zombies.)

As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], monsters represented by {{white|P}} ([[gray ooze]], [[brown pudding|brown]] and [[black pudding]], [[green slime]]) leave [[glob]]s instead of corpses.  Globs can be eaten like corpses, but not sacrificed or [[revive]]d.  In earlier versions of NetHack, and variants based on earlier versions, these monsters leave corpses.

==Special corpse behavior==

* [[Lizard]] and acidic corpses cure stoning.
* Lizard and [[lichen]] corpses never rot away, and never cause [[food poisoning]]. (They do, however, get too old to [[sacrifice]].)
* [[Troll]] corpses (all {{white|T}}) come back to life 75% of the time.
* The [[Riders|Riders']] corpses have a chance of coming back to life starting 12 turns after their "death".
* Acid blob corpses never cause [[food poisoning]], they are safe (but damaging) to eat and are suitable for [[sacrifice]] until they rot away.

==Aging==
Corpses are generally most useful and safe when fresh, slowly [[rotten|rotting]] as the [[turn]]s pass. In most cases, with increasing age corpses become unsuitable for sacrifice or for feeding your pet, and also become harmful or even deadly for you to eat, until finally they rot away to nothing.

Corpses do not age while stored in an [[ice box]], and age at only half the normal rate while lying on [[ice]]. A [[tinning kit]] is also handy for preserving corpses for later consumption, by converting them into [[tin]]s.

Any corpse dug up from a [[grave]] will already be old, aged 100 turns.{{refsrc|src/dig.c|918|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} All [[mummy|mummies]], [[zombie]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[ghoul]]s are [[undead]]&mdash;walking corpses already&mdash;so any corpse they leave will be the same age.{{refsrc|src/mon.c|307|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

Your [[god]] regards a corpse as "fresh" up to a maximum age of 50 and will accept its sacrifice on an [[altar]].{{refsrc|src/pray.c|1301|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} If the corpse is too old, "Nothing happens." Even lizard and lichen corpses are subject to this limit, but acid blob corpses are an exception, suitable for sacrifice at any age.

[[Pet]]s regard a corpse as "old" once its age reaches 50 turns.{{refsrc|src/dog.c|792|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/dog.c|770|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} Most pets will refuse to eat old corpses, except for lizard and lichen corpses; however, [[ghoul]]s eat old corpses exclusively.

When you yourself eat a corpse, the effect of age is more complex, as the corpse progresses through several degrees of rottenness:
* Lizard and lichen corpses are always safe for your consumption.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|51|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1552|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
* For other corpses, rottenness is determined as age divided by random integer from 10 to 29, with a +2 bonus for being cursed or &minus;2 for being blessed.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1542|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
* If the rottenness is 6 or more, the corpse is considered "tainted" and will give you fatal [[food poisoning]], causing you to die in 10&ndash;19 turns. The corpse then rots completely, without any further effects (no nutrition or intrinsics conferred, no damage from poisonous corpses, etc.){{refsrc|src/eat.c|1552|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}
** [[Acid blob]]s are never tainted.
** [[Cockatrice]], chickatrice, and [[Medusa]] corpses [[Stoning|turn you to stone]] regardless of age. If you are petrification resistant, the corpses can be tainted and poison you as normal.
** If you eat a tainted corpse while being [[Immunity to sickness|immune to sickness]], you will not become sick, but the corpse still rots completely, conferring no nutrition, intrinsics, etc.
** If you were sick already, eating a tainted corpse re-rolls the number of turns you have left to live, compares it to the current number, and takes the lower of the two. Eating the corpse also takes 1 turn, so you will always be closer to death afterward.
* Otherwise, if the rottenness is at least 4 ("old"), and you are not sickness resistant, there is a 20% chance that you "feel sick" and lose 1d8 HP. Dying from this damage will display the death message "killed by a cadaver".
** If the rottenness is 6 or more but the corpse is not tainted, the chance is 100%. 
** In addition to sickness resistance, you are completely protected from this damage if the corpse is poisonous or you receive acidic damage from it.
* In the absence of other negative effects, unless the corpse is a lizard, lichen, or acidic, there is still a {{frac|7}} chance of a corpse turning out to be [[Comestible#Rotten food|rotten]] in the same sense as non-corpse comestibles, with the associated consequences.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1599|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} 
* Otherwise, you receive the full benefit of eating a fresh corpse.

All unrevived corpses except lizards and lichens eventually disintegrate, quietly disappearing from the game. This happens at an age of approximately 250 turns, with some random variation.{{refsrc|src/mkobj.c|1125|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|You have a constitution in 100 chance of surviving food poisoning. If you do, you lose 1 point of constitution and abuse constitution.}}

==독성과 산성 시체들==

모든 독성 몬스터의 시체는 {{frac|4|5}}의 독성일 확률을 가집니다. 만약 당신이 독 저항이 아닌 채로 독성 시체를 먹게 된다면, 당신은 1&ndash;4 힘과 1&ndash;15 체력을 잃게 됩니다.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1581|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

산성 몬스터들은 항상 산성 시체를 남깁니다. 만약 당신이 산성 저항이 아닌 채로 시체를 먹게 된다면, 당신은 "심각한 속쓰림 (a very bad case of stomach acid)"을 앓게 되며 1&ndash;15 체력을 잃게 됩니다.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1577|version=NetHack 3.6.0}}

==시체의 이점과 위험성==
산성과 독성 시체들은 1d15 피해를 줍니다.{{refsrc|src/eat.c|1580|version=NetHack 3.6.0}} 오래된 시체들은 종종 1d8 피해를 줍니다.
이 문서에서 언급되지 않은 시체들은 이점도 없고, 해롭지도 않습니다.

===Gaining intrinsics===
Most, though not all, corpse-eating effects are chances of gaining intrinsics. The chance of gaining an intrinsic from a intrinsic-providing corpse is based on the monster's base level and the amount of intrinsics it can provide. If a monster can provide multiple intrinsics, there is an equal chance of each being conferred, even if you already possess the intrinsic. Once one intrinsic is picked from the list, there is a ''level''/15 chance that it will be conferred. [[Telepathy]], [[teleportitis]], and [[teleport control]] are exceptions; telepathy is guaranteed, teleportitis is ''level''/10, and teleport control is ''level''/12. [[Killer bee]] and [[scorpion]] corpses are also exceptions; their chance of conferring poison resistance is (''level''+5)/20.

=== Corpses that are both beneficial and harmful ===

This section lists corpses which both provide benefit beyond nutrition value, and are harmful beyong being acidic, or cause an effect which may be both beneficial and harmful.

The following corpses are poisonous but also confer poison resistance:
* [[green dragon]] (always confers)
* [[Chromatic Dragon]] (always confers one of: poison, sleep, fire, cold, shock, disintegration)
* [[cobra]], [[pit viper]], [[snake]], and [[water moccasin]]
* [[giant beetle]]
* [[giant spider]]
* [[scorpion]] and [[Scorpius]] (the latter always confers)
* [[gremlin]]
* [[guardian naga]]
* [[homunculus]] (also confers sleep resistance; only 7% chance for each)
* [[jellyfish]]
* [[killer bee]] and [[queen bee]]
* [[soldier ant]]
* [[xan]]
* [[yellow mold]] (also causes [[hallucination]]; has only 7% chance of conferring poison resistance)
* [[Medusa]] (kills instantly by [[stoning|petrification]]; if [[Stoning#Stoning_resistant_monsters|stoning resistant]], or saved by [[amulet of life saving]], always confers poison resistance)

Some poisonous monsters are beneficial in other ways:
* [[quantum mechanic]] (always toggles intrinsic [[speed]])
* [[salamander]] (confers fire resistance)

Finally, there are non-poisonous corpses which are good or bad:
* Eating a [[chameleon]] or [[doppelganger]] corpse will [[polymorph]] you. Doppelgangers are human, so beware of [[cannibalism]].
* Eating a [[disenchanter]] corpse is generally bad. One of the following intrinsics is randomly selected:<ref>[Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/eat.c#1034]</ref><ref>[Source:NetHack_3.6.0/src/sit.c#attrcurse]</ref> fire resistance, cold resistance, poison resistance, telepathy, invisibility, see invisible, speed, stealth, intrinsic protection, teleportitis, aggravate monsters. If you possess the chosen intrinsic, you lose it. Of these, only teleportitis, aggravate monsters, and invisibility could be detrimental.
* [[Leprechaun]]s and all [[nymph]]s confer [[teleportitis]]. This can be inconvenient if you lack [[teleport control]].
* [[Master Kaen]] confers poison resistance, but being human (and Monks' [[Quest Nemesis]]), he's likely to trigger [[cannibalism]].
* [[Nurse]]s fully heal, and have a 73% chance of granting poison resistance. Nurses are human, so beware of [[cannibalism]].
* [[Cockatrice]] and [[chickatrice]] corpses kill you instantly by petrification, but if you are [[petrification resistance|resistant]] or saved by [[amulet of life saving]], you may become poison resistant.
* [[Stalker]] corpses make you temporarily invisible for 50&ndash;149 turns. If you are already invisible, it will make you permanently invisible and grant [[see invisible]]. Eating one will also [[stun]] you for 60+ turns.
* [[Violet fungus|Violet fungi]] cause hallucination for 200+ turns, but may confer poison resistance.
* The [[Wizard of Yendor]] confers one of: fire resistance, poison resistance, teleport control, and teleportitis. He is a human, so beware of [[cannibalism]].
* [[Giant zombie]]s and [[Giant mummy|mummies]] may increase your strength, but have a high risk of food poisoning that is best avoided by using a [[tinning kit]].
* [[Elf zombie]]s and [[Elf mummy|mummies]] may convey sleep resistance, but can cause food poisoning. As with undead giants, using a tinning kit is best.

=== Corpses that are only harmful ===
The following corpses cause harm without any beneficial effect except nutrition:
* Eating corpses of your own race constitutes [[cannibalism]]. Unless you are an [[orc]] or [[Caveman]], you gain the [[aggravate monster]] intrinsic, and lose 2&ndash;5 points of [[Luck]]. All {{white|@}} except elves, along with all {{white|K}}, are human, including [[werecreature]]s and [[doppelganger]]s. Other races are obvious.
** Eating [[abbot]]s also inflicts hallucination.
* [[Cat]]s and [[dog]]s confer the [[aggravate monster]] intrinsic, unless you are an [[orc]] or [[Caveman]].
* The following are poisonous without beneficial effects: all [[kobold]]s, [[rabid rat]]s, [[baby green dragon]]s, [[vampire bat]]s, and the worst, [[green slime]] globs, which are acidic and will sometimes cause [[sliming]].
* [[Bat]]s and [[giant bat]]s [[stun]] for 30+ and 60+ turns respectively.
* All [[mimic]]s temporarily prevent movement.
* Eating any of the [[Riders]] will kill you. Even if you have an [[amulet of life saving]], they will revive before you can finish.
* All [[undead]] corpses along with those generated on top of [[traps]] can cause [[food poisoning]].
** Tinning undead corpses makes them safe to eat. There is also a small chance that you will not get food poisoning if you eat the corpse quickly enough, but trying it is very dangerous unless you have a [[unicorn horn]].

=== Acidic corpses and blobs ===

The following corpses and blobs are acidic without any other beneficial or harmful effects (nutrition value in parentheses):
* [[acid blob]] (10)
* [[yellow dragon]] (1500) and their babies (500)
* [[green mold]] (30)
* [[ochre jelly]] (20)

== Variants ==
In [[SLASH'EM]], corpses sometimes get overgrown with molds. This behavior has also been ported to [[xNetHack]]. Knowing this, players may get extra resistances or lichen corpses. See [[Fungus#SLASH'EM|Fungus § SLASH'EM]] for more details.

* [[Death drop]]s: items that sometimes appear when a monster leaves a corpse
* [[Glob]]: comestible left by some monsters instead of a corpse as of [[NetHack 3.6.0]]

&&%s&& %s Luck item {150185 2023-03-09T12:17:54Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom} /* Strategy */* A '''luck item''' is a general term for any item in ''[[NetHack]]'' that changes your [[Luck]] and/or Luck timeout, such as a [[luckstone]]. Some [[artifact]]s can "act as a luckstone" when carried, and function in the exact same way as one in addition to their other effects.{{refsrc|include/artifact.h|30|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/artifact.c|302|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

* [[The Orb of Fate]]{{refsrc|include/artilist.h|240|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}

==Strategy==
{{main|Luck}}
Since all luck items in vanilla ''NetHack'' outside of the luckstone are [[quest artifact]]s, the ability to obtain a luck item can render the guaranteed luckstone within [[Mines' End]] redundant. Some characters whose role this applies to may elect to postpone their trip to the [[Gnomish Mines]] in favor of [[Sokoban]], for example, or else choose not to proceed beyond [[Minetown]]; other players may want a luckstone to tide them over until they obtain their quest artifact.

There is usually little tangible benefit to carrying multiple luck items in open inventory - spare luckstones can be kept within a [[container]] in the event your primary source of Luck is cursed. While an uncursed luckstone can suffice in most cases, blessing one allows bad luck to time out and provides a buffer against the [[curse items]] [[monster spell]] and other similar effects. Other luck items may be preferred in the main inventory over luckstones due to the benefits from their [[base item]]s: all of them are [[intelligent]] quest artifacts that will resist the [[curse items]] spell 80% of the time, so blessing them is an unambiguous boon, and the quest artifact for your role will always be generated as blessed.

==Variants==
Some variants include other Luck-altering items that may function differently from a luckstone - see [[:Category:Variant luck items]] for a list of these items.

 |name=summoning

}}

The '''wand of summoning''' is an item in [[FIQHack]] that replaces the [[wand of create monster]]. 

==Generation==
Monsters may be generated with a wand of summoning in their inventory as either a [[defensive item|defensive]] or an [[offensive item]]. 

==Effects==
Similar to the wand of create monster, zapping the wand of summoning will temporarily summon one or more monsters, with the number and duration dependent on the user's [[skill]] [[Wands Balance Patch|in wands]]:

* Unskilled: 1 monster, 5 turns
* Basic: d2 monsters, 10 turns
* Skilled: d4 monsters, 15 turns
* Expert: d8 monsters, 20 turns
* Master: d16 monsters, 25 turns

==Strategy==
While the wand of summoning is eligible for both offensive and defensive item distribution, the monster AI will primarily use it offensively in order to swarm the player. Once you identify a monster with a wand of summoning, you may want to defeat it as soon as possible, ''if'' at all possible - getting rid of the wand in some manner may also work. Otherwise, standard crowd control tactics are recommended, and even retreating is viable for outlasting the summoned monsters if you cannot take them all on, as they will eventually disappear.

==Notes==
See the [[spellbook of summoning]] for more details.

&&%s&& %s Spellbook of summoning {139012 2021-04-17T20:01:15Z {4001279 Umbire the Phantom}  The '''spellbook of summoning''' is a [[spellbook]] that appears exclusively in [[FIQHack]]. It weighs 40 aum and replaces the [[spellbook of create monster]]. When read, it allows you to learn the '''summon monster''' spell.

==Description==
Summon monster is a [[clerical spell]]; when cast, the spell creates a random monster much like the spell of create monster, and the caster can select the square they are generated on. However, the monster will only be present for a limited amount of time, dependent on the caster's skill level - the monster will last for 5 turns at Unskilled level, 10 at Basic, 15 at Skilled, and 20 at Expert.

Aside from limited "lifespan", summoned monsters have other limits as well - summoned monsters will not generate with their usual [[monster starting inventory]], do not leave a corpse, and do not benefit from [[lifesaving]]. Killing them does not give experience or alignment penalties or bonuses, and items they pick up will drop when they disappear. While a summoned monster can themselves summon other monsters, those monsters will disappear when their summoners do.

In both cases, a monster is created.

The major difference between the two scrolls is that summoned monsters only exist for a limited amount of time, based on the [[beatitude]] of the scroll:
* Blessed: 20 turns
* Uncursed: 10 turns
* Cursed: 100 turns

In addition, if the scroll is cursed, the monster will be centered on you, hostile, and hasted.

If you read a scroll of summoning while [[confused]], a random item with the same beatitude as the scroll will be created.

Other than the case of reading a cursed scroll, you will be prompted to select a location for the creation of the new monster.

See the [[spellbook of summoning]] for other details on the difference between summon and create monster.

==Description==
The '''<code>M3_TRAITOR</code>''' monster flag denotes monsters that have a chance of spontaneously rebelling against the player when tame and becoming hostile; dNetHack uses '''<code>MT_TRAITOR</code>''' for the same purpose. Monsters that have turned on you will additionally have the text "traitor" added when examined with a [[stethoscope]] or [[wand of probing]].

The check for betrayal occurs whenever you abuse the pet, as well as with a 1 in 850 chance on every move.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|716|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F3}} The betrayal check will always fail if the pet is a spell being, is further than 3 squares away, is mindless, or if you have more hit points than the pet. If those checks pass, then there is a <math>(21-tameness)(abuse+1)/66(abuse+2)</math> chance that the pet will turn traitor.{{refsrc|dogmove.c|637|version=SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F3}} Thus, increasing the pet's tameness and not abusing them will ''decrease'' the chance of rebellion, but the only "certain" way to eliminate chance of it occurring is to raise your HP.

{{todo|Gather additional info, expand Grunt and Slice in particular}}
==GruntHack==
===Racial benefits and restrictions===
The giant's size and thick hide grants them an improved base AC of 6 (compared to 10 for standard vanilla races); they are also capable of lifting boulders, which are treated as completely weightless much like they are for non-player giants and giant polyforms in vanilla ''NetHack''. However, they cannot wear body armor of any kind, and are too large to fit through narrow diagonal gaps; fortunately, this means that giants also cannot fall through [[trap door]]s.

Note that an [[encumbrance]] warning may occasionally display when attempting to pick up a boulder, even when using {{kbd|m}} to move over one.

==EvilHack==
The giant was added as a playable race in version 0.1.2, adapted and modified from GruntHack and SliceHack.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/master/doc/evilhack-changelog.md#version-012 EvilHack changelog]</ref>

Giants can be any [[alignment]], and can be played as a [[Barbarian]], [[Caveman]], [[Infidel]], [[Monk]], [[Priest]], [[Samurai]], [[Valkyrie]], or [[Wizard]].

===Racial benefits and restrictions===
Player giants have [[infravision]] like most non-[[human]] races, possess faster hit point regeneration in comparison to human characters, and gain hungerless [[regeneration]] at experience level 12. However, their movement speed of 10 is markedly slower compared to other races, and they also have an innate [[aggravate monster]] property that they cannot override with most forms of [[stealth]]; the sole exception is being granted the property via successful [[pray]]er on their [[god]]'s [[altar]].

Giants know the identity of all worthless pieces of glass, and start the game with some random [[gems]] identified - they are also capable of using uncursed [[touchstone]]s as blessed similar to [[gnome]]s, and can [[dig]] as well as any [[dwarf]]. They can also easily pick up and carry boulders, which can additionally be stacked like any other projectile, and weigh 8 [[aum]] for giants as opposed to the standard 6000 aum; {{kbd|m}} can be used to walk over a boulder rather than push it. In [[Sokoban]], a giant player will be given a prompt for picking up or moving onto a boulder, and boulder-related penalties are doubled to -2 [[Luck]]; this does not apply if you have already solved the level, making each floor a valuable source of powerful projectiles.

As in GruntHack, giants have a base AC of 6 due to their size and thick hide; they are also immune to [[engulfing]] and falling through trap doors (though they can enter them at will), and can tear through webbing with ease. Their size also prevents them from fitting through small spaces or wearing the mass majority of body armor, including cloaks and shirts - the only exceptions are [[chromatic dragon scales]] and the [[large splint mail]] that only the Giant Samurai who start with them are capable of using; fortunately, the Sokoban prize armor is tailored so that player characters of all species can use them, including giants. They also take extra damage from projectiles fired by [[sling]]s, and cannot [[ride]] the vast majority of steeds in the game. 

Giants' size and strength grant additional advantages elsewhere, however: in addition to making strength-based actions easier, giants excel in combat with their [[bare hands]] and with [[club]]s - they have a greater chance of stunning an opponent with a club or punch, and can shatter a foe's wielded weapon with almost any wielded weapon of their own. Giants can also wield [[two-handed weapon]]s in one hand, and may even [[twoweapon]] them as well. The [[woolly mammoth]] is the sole available steed for giants, and is a suitably powerful choice for a pet in its own right, capable of steamrolling several late-game monsters.

====Attribute caps====

Giants have increased initial and maximum carrying capacity to complement their higher strength and constitution caps - but their movement speed and caps for dexterity, intelligence, and charisma are much lower.

====Price adjustments====
The following price adjustments are used for giant interactions with [[Racial monster|racial]] [[shopkeeper]]s:

{|class="wikitable"

|}

===Starting equipment===
Giants may start with random valuable gems in their inventory. Many roles' normal starting items, primarily pieces of body armor, are also exchanged to accommodate their body size and natural AC so that a given giant is ''at least'' roughly around the role's usual starting AC.<ref>[https://github.com/k21971/EvilHack/blob/0.7.1/src/u_init.c#L271 EvilHack 0.7.0 u_init.c, line 271]</ref>The differences in starting inventory are as follows:

{| class="prettytable"
! Standard item(s)              !! Replacement item(s)                  !! Affected roles
|-
| [[ring mail]]                 || +0 [[helmet]]                 || [[Barbarian]]
|-
| [[cloak of magic resistance]] || [[amulet of magic resistance]]<br>+0 [[low boots]] || [[Wizard]]
|-
| [[splint mail]]               || [[large splint mail]]         || [[Samurai]]
|-
| [[robe]]                      || +1 [[high boots]]             || [[Monk]], [[Priest]]
|-
| [[leather armor]]             || +0 helmet                     || [[Caveman]]
|-
| [[leather jacket]]            || +1 low boots                  || [[Infidel]]
|-
| [[cloak of protection]]       || +0 [[gauntlets of protection]]|| Infidel
|}

===Strategy===
As most giants are unable to wear most body armor, players should plan their goals, [[wish]]es and [[ascension kit]]s accordingly. [[Reflection]] is somewhat more lenient to obtain as a [[property]], since you can go for an amulet, shield or an artifact you can sacrifice for (such as the highly-desired [[Dragonbane#EvilHack|Dragonbane]]). Magic resistance is somewhat more difficult, since an amulet is the only non-artifact source.

Strength-boosting comestibles such as [[spinach]] give giants more strength on average because they can exceed 18/** strength; however, unless playing the Caveman role, giants cannot eat giant corpses due to the [[Luck]] and [[alignment record]] penalties from [[cannibalism]], and alignment record penalties have more gameplay implications in EvilHack.

Most giant players should consider gathering a stack of boulders as soon as possible - they can use multiple boulders to kill far stronger monsters on offense, and can arrange a wall or [[boulder fort]] to block off or constrain monsters on defense; such boulders can also be used to make a path through water-blocked areas like the [[Gnomish Mines]]. However, defensive measures are usually best established in advance due to the giant's low speed; a hostile monster with a [[wand of striking]] can easily destroy a boulder fort, and boulders also cannot stop hostile giants or [[phasing]] monsters. Sokoban and random boulder rooms are usually good sources of boulders, and digging monsters will often leave behind boulders while moving around the level.

===Racial benefits and restrictions===
Giants can pick up and throw boulders, but their size prevents them from wearing most normal armor. They move at half-speed and have a heightened attribute cap for strength, but significantly lower caps for every other attribute.

The '''giant mosquito''', {{orange|a}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It is a tiny insect with two bite attacks, including a [[poison]]ous bite that can weaken the victim's constitution.

==Generation==
Giant mosquitoes often generate in large [[group]]s, and generally start appearing within the first few floors of the dungeon.

==Strategy==
The giant mosquito is small and fast, and being surrounded by a large group of them can be a serious problem for a lower-level player without [[poison resistance]]. 

==Encyclopedia Entry==
{{encyclopedia|
Red Saunders said he could take anything.  The men found a corner
of the island where thick clouds of mosquitos were hovering above
the still water.  The workmen built a small, smoldering fire to
give off smoke that would give them some shelter.  And Red stripped
off his shirt and lay face down in the mud, letting the mosquitoes
go to work on his back.  And work they did.  Red's back was soon
covered with the insects, digging in, drawing blood, and leaving
itchy welts behind.  But Red didn't flinch.  He just lay there,
letting the mosquitos feed on him, and only occasionally looking up
to say "I sure hope those mosquitos over there ain't getting to be
too much for y'all" to the men sheltering in the smoke.  This went
on and on.  But when about three-quarters of that hour had passed,
something happened.  Red felt something bite into his back sharper
and more powerful than he had ever imagined.  A searing, sharp pain,
bit into his flesh, and he heard one of the men by the fire yell out
"Gallinipper!"
           [ The Legend of the Gallinipper,
                Averasboro, North Carolina, circa. 1855 ]

There are in this country over thirty varieties of mosquitoes.
Some are small and others are quite large.  Some live wholly on
vegetable juices, while others have a passion for animal fluids.
The largest, and perhaps the most ferocious kind, is one which the
steamboatmen of the Mississippi River call the galnipper.  Of it
they tell strange stories.  They describe it as being as large as a
goose; and they gravely declare that it flies about at night with a
brick-bat under its wings to sharpen its beak with.

The '''rabid dog''', {{gray|d}}, is a [[monster]] that appears in [[EvilHack]]. It has a [[poison]]ous bite that is [[constitution]]-draining, similar to a [[rabid rat]].

==Strategy==
While its bite is stronger than that of a [[little dog]], it is a bit slower than one.

==Encyclopedia Entry==


{{encyclopedia|
	A domestic animal, the _tame dog_ (_Canis familiaris_), of
	which numerous breeds exist.  The male is called a dog,
	while the female is called a bitch.  Because of its known
	loyalty to man and gentleness with children, it is the
	world's most popular domestic animal.  It can easily be
	trained to perform various tasks.
