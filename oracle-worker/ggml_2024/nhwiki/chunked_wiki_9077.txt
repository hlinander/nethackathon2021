The '''Ninja''' is a [[monster]] in ''[[NetHack]]'' that is notable as the only non-unique, non-randomly-generated hostile monsters to appear on a [[Quest]].

==Generation==

They appear only during the [[Samurai quest]], and are generated on the home level, the Shogun's castle, and the keep of the [[quest nemesis]], [[Ashikaga Takauji]].

As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], ninjas are generated with 6-11 [[shuriken]] (75% chance) or [[darts]] (25% chance), and a [[short sword]] (75% chance) or axe (25% chance) as their main weapon.

==Strategy==

They are an excellent source of the otherwise extremely rare shuriken for samurai.

==History==

There was once a [[Ninja (role)|Ninja role]], which was replaced by the Rogue role from [[NetHack 3.0.0]] on.

&&%s&& %s Delayed instadeath {139232 2021-04-24T00:14:09Z {4001463 Actual-nh} /* FIQHack */ Better link A '''delayed instadeath''' is an effect that is not immediately fatal, but will cause you to [[instadeath|die ''instantly'']] after some delay period, regardless of how many [[hitpoint]]s you have at the time.  These effects are generally treatable, so long as you are prepared, and act quickly.

Common examples are the delayed [[stoning]] from a [[cockatrice]]'s hiss, or the [[disease]] attack that some [[unique monster]]s have.

== Etymology ==
Although the term ''delayed instadeath'' sounds self-contradictory, it is the accepted term in the roguelike community. ''Insta[nt]'' can be understood as referring only to the final reduction of hitpoints, which occurs in one fell swoop once the delay period is over.

== Therapy ==
Delayed instadeaths are regarded as major problems by your [[god]], so [[prayer]] will normally save you, as long as it is otherwise safe to pray.

== Examples ==
The following delayed instadeaths exist in NetHack:

* [[Stoning|Turning to stone]] as a result of being hit by a [[cockatrice]]'s special attack, attacked by a monster wielding a cockatrice corpse, or eating a cockatrice egg (and likewise for chickatrices). The standard cure is to eat a lizard corpse or quaff a [[potion of acid]]. Eating any acidic corpse will work too.
* [[Sliming]] (turning into green slime). Curable by setting yourself on fire or casting the "{{spell of|cure sickness}}" spell.
* [[Food poisoning]] from eating an old corpse or [[disease]] from the sickness attack of [[Juiblex]], [[Scorpius]], [[Demogorgon]], or [[Pestilence]], or as one of the effects of applying a cursed [[unicorn horn]]. Curable by applying a non-cursed unicorn horn (risky, as it may fail) or casting "cure sickness".
* Sinking in [[lava]]. Fix this by [[pray]]ing, zapping a [[wand of cold]] downward, or [[teleportation|teleporting]].
* Strangulation, from wearing an [[amulet of strangulation]]. Instantly curable by removing the amulet, but amulets of strangulation are normally generated cursed.
* [[Drowning attack]]s of [[giant eel]]s, [[electric eel]]s, [[kraken]]s, [[couatl]]s, and [[python]]s.
* [[Digestion]] attacks of [[purple worm]]s and [[trapper]]s. The exact time of death is random and based on attributes. This can be prevented by killing or escaping from the monster, such as by putting on a [[ring of slow digestion]] or zapping a [[wand of digging]].

Normally, [[prayer]] will not save you from the last two delayed instadeaths, though a sufficiently [[anger|angry]] god could unintentionally save you from digestion by blasting the monster with lightning while trying to kill you.

==FIQHack==

[[FIQHack]] adds [[zombie#FIQHack|zombie]] attack delayed instadeath.  If a zombie strikes you enough times in a short enough period, you will be afflicted with a fatal zombification disease that will kill you when a timer runs out.

OK since it is now September 22nd, I am changing the featured article to [[Knight]]. I hope i did it right. [[User:Spazm|Spazm]] 16:49, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

== Automatizing the featured articles ==

In Wikipedia the featured article changes daily instead of monthy like here, so it's not done by hand but prepared beforehand and changed automatically. There's this Mediawiki special code that produces the current date: "<nowiki>{{#time:F j, Y}}</nowiki>" renders as "{{#time:F j, Y}}". Now, put that code inside a template call and you can call a different template each month: you could have {{t|Featured article/January}}, {{t|Featured article/February}}, etc. and you'd just need to edit those.

Of course someone would still need to work as the editor but they could do their job up to a year in advance. Also, that scheme would rotate the featured articles in 12 month cycles in case anyone forgot to add new content to the templates, but I find that acceptable. Who remembers what was featured a year ago, anyway?

What do you think? It takes some setting up but I believe it would be worth it because we wouldn't run into awkward situations where we'd have last month's featured article on the main page. &mdash;[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] (<small>[[User talk:ZeroOne|talk]]</small>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<small>[[Special:Emailuser/ZeroOne|@]]</small>) 14:22, January 10, 2010 (UTC)

: Sounds good, in my opinion we should do as you describe. A minor pitfall could be: someone would still need to manually brush up the articles before they automatically and silently get featured. -[[User:Tjr|Tjr]] 14:55, January 10, 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that this is a good idea, though I have one suggestion: it might be easier if we use template parameters (e.g. <nowiki>{{Featured article|January}}</nowiki> and <nowiki>{{Featured article|February}}</nowiki>) so that we don't have to maintain 12 different templates. —[[User:Shijun|Shijun]] 22:53, January 10, 2010 (UTC)

::Thanks for your comments! I'm not sure if maintaining one lengthy template is any easier than maintaining 12 short ones?

A '''ranged attack''' is one that can hit a target more than one square away. Ranged attacks will not trigger many of the [[passive attack]]s that can occur in [[melee]], even if the target is within melee range.

== List of ranged attacks ==

Some examples of ranged attacks are:
*Anything that is [[thrown]], especially [[Projectile#Thrown_objects|those meant to be thrown]]
*Projectiles shot from the appropriate [[Projectile#Launchers_and_their_ammunitions|launcher]]
*Attack [[wand]]s, notably [[Wand of striking|striking]], [[Wand_of_magic_missile|magic missile]], [[Wand of cold|cold]], [[Wand of fire|fire]], and [[Wand of lightning|lightning]]
*Most [[attack spell]]s, such as [[force bolt]]
*Monster [[breath]] attacks
*[[Pounding]] with a [[polearm]] or [[lance]]

== Strategy ==
Some players (especially when playing [[ranger]]s and [[rogue]]s) use it as a strategy throughout the entire game, using it preferentially over melee combat. This is a relatively unpopular strategy (because it requires more effort to play, not necessarily because it's weaker); however, even characters who more commonly use melee combat will often want to use a ranged attack on occasion.

=== When characters who rely on melee may want to use a ranged attack ===
There are a few situations in which melee attacks work badly, and ranged attacks tend to be the most easily obtainable alternative solution.

==== Monsters with special and passive attacks ====
Several monsters have [[passive attack]]s, dealing damage only to enemies that attack them in melee. Often, melee characters will choose simply to endure the damage of these attacks, but in some cases (such as when attacking [[blue jelly|blue jellies]] without [[cold resistance]], or [[floating eye]]s without [[reflection]]), this can be incredibly dangerous. One common solution to such monsters is to throw an easily obtainable [[missile weapon]] that does not require a launcher, such as [[orcish dagger]]s, or perhaps [[dart]]s or even [[rock]]s. (In the case of floating eyes encountered early in the game, one potential solution is to throw orcish daggers at them, then use [[Elbereth]] to persuade them to move off the square, pick up the daggers, and repeat; this is time-consuming, but likely to succeed.) [[Wizard]]s may wish to use their starting spell of {{spell of|force bolt}} to deal with such monsters, even when using a melee strategy (which although uncommon for wizards, is feasible).

Against monsters with very dangerous special attacks which can do something to you that can't be entirely prevented by armor, high hitpoints or intrinsic resistances such as [[gremlin]]s at night (steal intrinsics) and especially [[mind flayer]]s (amnesia). Further [[cockatrice]]s and related hazards (petrification), [[nymph]]s (theft), the [[Riders]], and anything wielding [[Vorpal Blade]]. Note that even if the mind flayers' intelligence-drain becomes pointless due to an [[unicorn horn]], there is no way to restore amnesia, so even a single successful hit can become your doom (think of [[magic marker|writing scrolls]]) or at least be very annoying.

==== Monsters with strong melee attacks ====
Some enemies are slow but dangerous, such as [[mumak]]il. Potential solutions to such monsters in [[NetHack 3.4.3]] included Elbereth, and abusing the speed system by attacking them and retreating before they get a turn (known as the [[hit and run]] technique), but a safer solution for an inexperienced or inattentive player is to do the same thing at range (known as "kiting"); and in [[NetHack 3.6.0]] and later, the more dangerous solutions have been made less effective and are not worth using. The idea is that you stay 2 to 3 squares away from the monster and repeatedly blast it with ranged attacks; when it approaches, simply run away and repeat. In the absence of other monsters in the area, this is guaranteed to succeed unless you run out of ammo first, and requires much less concentration than the melee method. (This strategy would also work well against [[mimic]]s, except for the fact that they are often generated in [[shop]]s, where using a missile weapon would result in the shopkeeper claiming the weapon for themselves, and with spells and magical items you need to be careful not to accidentally destroy the shop's stock or hit the shopkeeper.)

Against powerful melee-only enemies that can outrun you, such as [[minotaur]]s, it helps to deal ranged damage to them to "soften them up" before they close into melee range, where you can melee them to death. This is only really necessary or useful if you would have difficulty dealing with them in one-on-one combat, so it generally only applies in the few areas of the game where you encounter enemies that you would struggle to beat one-on-one in melee (most commonly, just above the Castle, and sometimes in the [[Gnomish Mines]] (especially on levels which contain [[polymorph trap]]s); this range can be considerably larger in [[conduct]] games, though). What weapon you use will depend on the situation; in an emergency, you would generally use an [[attack wand]] or similarly powerful ranged attack.

==== Terrain limitations ====

Sometimes an enemy cannot easily be engaged in melee, or you may wish to not allow them into melee range. Examples include fighting a monster on the opposite side of a [[boulder]] in [[Sokoban]] (or in confined spaces elsewhere, but in Sokoban you need to kill the monster to be able to continue), when approaching the [[Castle]] through its back entrance (in which case there will be [[trap door]]s between you and the enemy monsters), or when fighting [[Croesus]] (he has no ranged attack and you can destroy the entrance door to [[Fort Ludios]] to allow you to attack him at range, allowing you to kill him without fear of reprisal). In such cases, you either have to, or want to, use ranged attacks, to avoid closing into melee range. In general, the best attacks to use here are ones which do not run out of ammunition or [[energy]] quickly; [[rocks]] can be a good choice (especially in Sokoban, where they are readily available either from boulders destroyed earlier due to mistakes, or by destroying [[statue]]s on the [[Oracle]] level), and where visibility and range allow, [[polearm]]s (although a melee character would not generally carry a polearm habitually, they might pick one up to prepare for such a situation they know will happen soon).

=== Using ranged combat as a strategy for the entire game ===
An interesting strategy, and one that can produce good results, is to focus a character build almost entirely on ranged combat. Good classes for this include the [[Ranger]] and [[Rogue]]; the strategy is also possible, past the early game, for most other character classes (many players choose to play [[Wizard]]s like this eventually), but starting characters of other classes will generally run out of ammunition, [[energy]] or even [[nutrition]] early if they attempt it exclusively (for instance, a common beginner mistake with Wizards is to attempt to cast spells at everything, which fails in the early game due to energy and nutrition constraints; even with [[hungerless casting]], a Wizard will have to spend too much time waiting for their energy to recover).

==== Game stages ====

Early in the game, pretty much any character who tries this strategy will want to accumulate [[dagger]]s, no matter what they plan to use as their primary ranged weapon later. (The reason is that daggers do not get destroyed upon being thrown, meaning that the same daggers can be used repetitively without a fear of running out of resources. In the early game, there are no issues with [[moat]]s and similar terrain features to lose the daggers in.) Because dagger [[skill]] is trained both by throwing and wielding daggers, typically such a character would also wield a dagger, or a weapon using the same skill such as an [[athame]], for use as a melee weapon (and use it mostly on monsters that pose a minimal threat, such as [[lichen]]s and [[grid bug]]s; using ranged combat is overkill in such a circumstance). (If available, [[Magicbane]] makes a good choice, due to giving [[magic resistance]] when wielded and allowing quick engraving of Elbereth.) Orcish daggers are the most readily available sort in the early game; later on, regular daggers are easier to accumulate (and besides, more effective). While trying to accumulate a stock of daggers, use whatever cheaply available ammunition is available, such as [[dart]]s (obtainable by untrapping [[dart trap]]s), or a Ranger's starting stock of arrows; even [[rock]]s can be used in a pinch. (When using arrows, remember to wield your bow; the game will let you [[throw]] them by hand with the same keystrokes for shooting them from a bow, with no indication that you are doing this, but they will be much less effective.)

Later on, you will want to choose your main and secondary forms of ranged combat, and attempt to make them as effective as possible. In general, you will want to keep your daggers handy as a secondary ranged strategy for emergencies (such as running out of ammunition or energy), unless you use them as your primary strategy.

==== Daggers ====
Using thrown [[dagger]]s as your main combat strategy is known as [[daggerstorm]]ing, and can be a very effective strategy in the late game (although it requires more micromanagement than several others, due to needing to repeatedly reclaim the daggers). You will definitely want to raise your dagger skill as high as possible (often good advice whatever your strategy), as unlike many other skills, it benefits greatly from being at expert level, increasing your [[multishot]] capabilities (upon which the entire strategy relies). For multishot to work correctly, you will want to rely on a single large stack of daggers as your main ammo source (although the strategy is viable with as few as seven or eight, having a larger stack makes it much easier); enchanting them to +7 will help increase your damage output considerably, and blessing them is cheap and will help slightly; [[rustproof]]ing them helps more than it would using a melee strategy, because daggers with different erosion states will not stack, limiting your ability to multishot. The best sort of dagger to use for the strategy is the [[silver dagger]], but these are rare and almost impossible to get in large quantities, so players generally use the [[elven dagger]] or ordinary [[dagger]] instead. (Rogues get an extra pair of bonuses with this strategy, making them likely the optimal class for it; if they cause enemies to [[fleeing|flee]] using Elbereth or by weakening them to low hitpoints, they can [[backstab]] enemies even with thrown daggers, dealing massive damage.) 

==== Arrows ====
Upon accumulating a large number of [[arrow]]s, often by means of the [[Longbow of Diana]] (easily the best wielded weapon to use with this strategy, as it requires a [[bow]]), it's possible to use arrows as a major combat strategy. For this to work, it's almost imperative to [[bless]] the arrows you use (if generating them via the Longbow of Diana, you can bless it to cause it to generate blessed arrows), and to gain maximum [[luck]] (with a noncursed [[luckstone]] to maintain it at that level), as this reduces the rate at which the arrows break upon being fired, helping to conserve ammunition. Generally speaking, you would enchant arrows in batches, accumulating a large number of +0 arrows before enchanting them all simultaneously up to +6 or +7, then continuing to accumulate more +0 arrows in another batch while using the highly enchanted ones (this helps save on the huge number of [[scroll of enchant weapon|scrolls of enchant weapon]] the strategy would otherwise need, although it still consumes a lot more than other strategies would use). In situations where fired arrows would be easily subject to destruction or damage, such as near a [[gelatinous cube]], a [[black pudding]], or [[lava]], you would fire +0 arrows in order to not lose your highly enchanted arrows; otherwise, use highly enchanted arrows because they are less likely to break on impact. The best sort of arrows for use with this strategy, when available, are [[silver arrow]]s, but they are so rare that regular [[arrow]]s are likely the only viable choice. (Characters may also want to [[poison]] their arrows using a [[potion of sickness]] to do even more damage to monsters that are not poison-resistant; this is more useful in the early game than the late game, though, and can lead to [[alignment]] trouble for lawful characters even taking the huge alignment gains for killing enemies into account.) Keeping a stack of daggers handy is also useful just in case you ever end up running out of ammunition. This strategy is obviously the intended one for Rangers, who gain a larger multishot bonus with arrows than other characters; they can also daggerstorm well, though, and other characters may not do well using arrows.

==== Spells ====
As opposed to missiles, it's also possible to use [[spell]]s for a ranged-combat strategy, a common plan with [[Wizard]]s; [[Knight]]s can pull off such a strategy well after they have completed the [[Quest]] and obtained [[The Magic Mirror of Merlin]], but by the time they reach that stage of the game, it mostly doesn't matter what strategy they use, and continuing with their existing strategy can work better than changing. Due to the slow speed of [[energy]] regeneration, at low levels spells are best used only in emergencies, relying on a secondary damage source like daggers for other purposes; however, as character level increases (and especially, after you reclaim [[The Eye of the Aethiopica]], which is so useful for this strategy that anyone attempting it who can obtain it should try to as soon as possible), energy regeneration increases to the extent that attack spells can be used in basically every combat. Spell selection for this depends mostly on what [[spellbook]]s are available; Wizards will always be able to cast [[force bolt]] (unless they forget the spell and cannot relearn it again due to lack of access to its spellbook), and although force bolt works excellently for this strategy towards the start of the game, it becomes less powerful as time goes on. A spell with opposite properties is [[magic missile]], which scales sharply with character level, being inferior to force bolt towards the start of the game, and becoming much more powerful later on as your character level increases. This can be used as a staple spell, but the higher-level attack spells, {{spell of|cone of cold}} and {{spell of|fireball}}, work better (they have very similar properties, but so many monsters are immune to fireballs that you need a backup attack spell if you use that as your main attack spell). Of the other two [[attack spells]], [[finger of death]] is unsuitable as a staple spell due to its ineffectiveness against demons and huge energy cost, and [[drain life]] is similarly unsuitable due to being too easily resisted and not dealing damage fast enough (it is useful in other strategies, but not this one). Energy management is the only really difficult part of this strategy; easier monsters should be taken out with a melee weapon (perhaps [[Magicbane]]) to save on energy until the Eye is available, and you should try to aim spells to damage or kill multiple monsters at once.

==== Managing tedium ====
The strategy is generally unpopular, not because it does not work well, but because it requires more concentration and micromanaging than many other strategies; thus, it is not only slower to play (in real time), but increases the chance of making a mistake due to inattention. (For similar reasons, many players may find it less fun to play than a simple melee character.) For instance, allowing yourself to get surrounded by monsters can be very dangerous with such a strategy (necessitating the use of something like a [[scroll of teleport]], or using [[Elbereth]], to escape), compared to a melee strategy, although this strategy makes it easier to avoid in the first place. Using good [[autopickup exceptions]] can make playing with missile weapons a lot less tedious, and so is recommended if your version of NetHack has that feature available (and patches have been made to make the process still easier). When using a bow, it likewise helps to use the {{kbd|x}} command to swap between a bow and other wielded weapon quickly, at least until you have enough practice and ammo to make the bow a primary weapon throughout the entire game. One interesting compromise is to use this strategy throughout the midgame, then switch to melee for the endgame; at that point, your character is likely powerful enough to take on most enemies, and can still use ranged combat in an emergency, but this helps against the dangers of boredom and inattention.

According to the guidebook:
{{guidebook|Gnomes are smaller than but generally similar to dwarves. Gnomes are known to be expert miners, and it is known that a secret underground mine complex built by this race exists within the Mazes of Menace, filled with both riches and danger.}}

== Racial benefits and restrictions ==
Gnomes have [[infravision]] and can use [[uncursed]] [[touchstone]]s as if they were [[blessed]], like an [[Archaeologist]]. As a gnome, you will also find the gnomish inhabitants of the [[Gnomish Mines]] to be generally peaceful.

Gnomes are always [[neutral]]. They can be [[Archeologist]]s, [[Caveman|Cavemen]], [[Healer]]s, [[Ranger]]s, or [[Wizard]]s. From an [[attribute]] perspective, they are mostly average, with moderate [[strength]] and high [[intelligence]]. The following table outlines their maximum (unaided) attribute levels.

==Variants==
===SLASH'EM===
In [[SLASH'EM]], gnomes can also be [[Flame Mage]]s, [[Ice Mage]]s, or [[Undead Slayer]]s. Gnomes start with the [[vanish]] technique. At level 5, they gain [[stealth]]. When they reach level 7 they gain [[tinker]], which allows them to upgrade certain items.

Disintegration is one kind of [[instadeath]], which occurs when [[you]] are hit by a blast of disintegration.

== Sources ==

The only possible sources of disintegration blasts are a [[black dragon]]'s breath or a god's [[wide-angle disintegration beam]] (which can also destroy worn [[armor]] even if you are reflective or disintegration-resistant). There are no spells or wands of disintegration.

== Protection ==

[[Reflection]] will reflect a blast of disintegration, but not a wide angle disintegration beam. You can gain [[disintegration resistance]] by eating an adult [[black dragon]] [[corpse]], by wearing [[black dragon scales]] or [[black dragon scale mail]], or by polymorphing into any black dragon. This protects you from both sources of disintegration, and it protects your armor from a dragon's blast. (Reflective or black dragon armor is not destroyed by a god's wrath.)

[[Magic resistance]] does not save you from disintegration.

== Effects ==

If a dragon's blast of disintegration hits you or a monster, and you (or the monster) are neither resistant nor reflecting, it will destroy:{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3821|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3678|version=NetHack 3.6.6}}
# worn [[shield]], otherwise:
# worn [[body armor]] (and [[cloak]] if present), otherwise:
# [[instadeath|you]] (or the monster), plus cloak and [[shirt]] if present, and in the case of a monster, each inventory item (with probabilities of 95% for mundane objects, 50% for most artifacts, and 0% for your [[quest artifact]] and [[unique items]]).{{refsrc|src/zap.c|3995|version=NetHack 3.6.6}} An [[amulet of life saving]] will revive its disintegrated wearer (unless the wearer is a [[nonliving]] monster, which can only occur if a living monster wearing an amulet is polymorphed).

The same disintegration beam can affect a creature multiple times if it bounces.

==Other uses of the term==

Certain items can also disintegrate. A [[spellbook]] has a chance of disintegrating when you fail to read it. An uncursed [[scroll of scare monster]] disintegrates when picked up if it already has been picked up once, and a cursed one always disintegrates when picked up. In neither case does the game refer to the destruction as "disintegration".

As of [[NetHack 3.6.0]], you will "disintegrate into a pile of dust" if you try to sacrifice the [[Amulet of Yendor]] on the [[high altar]] in [[Moloch's Sanctum]] and survive Moloch's first attempt to kill you, even if you have disintegration resistance.

The two-way [[magic portal]] back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point. The [[Master of Thieves]] is at the point marked 'x', where there is also a [[chest]]; two [[thug]]s are in the room with him, and three and four more in the two rooms immediately connecting to his. Three of the four marked downstairs are actually [[mimic]]s; each of the four also has a water nymph and leprechaun next to it, and there are five to seven more water nymphs and leprechauns distributed about the streets; there are also eight to 10 [[chameleon]]s on the level, and sixteen random [[trap]]s.
The entire level is [[no-teleport]] and has [[undiggable]] walls and floor.

===Upper filler level===

This is an "ordinary" room-and-corridor level, with six rooms; five leprechauns, two water nymphs, and two guardian nagas; nine random objects; and eight random traps.

The stairway into the level is randomly placed in one of the rooms on the left side of the level. The [[Master Assassin]], with the [[Bell of Opening]] and the [[Master Key of Thievery]], is at the point marked {{msl|Master Assassin}}. The $-shaped pool is stocked with four [[shark]]s. There is a [[tin]] of chameleon meat at the marked spot {{cyan|%}} in a left-central room. Randomly placed around the level are eighteen leprechauns, eight guardian nagas, five chameleons, and three random N; thirteen random objects; and eleven random traps, in addition to the one marked spiked pit.

The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls. As a consequence, the level is effectively divided into four sections, the borders of which are marked in red above.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time: 
 Unexpectedly, you find yourself back in Ransmannsby, where you trained to
 be a thief.  Quickly you make the guild sign, hoping that you AND word
 of your arrival reach the Master of Thieves' den.

Next time:
 Once again, you find yourself back in Ransmannsby.  Fond memories are
 replaced by fear, knowing that the Master of Thieves is waiting for you.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 You rub your hands through your hair, hoping that the little ones on
 the back of your neck stay down, and prepare yourself for your meeting
 with the Master of Thieves.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "I hear that Lady Tyvefelle's household is lightly guarded."
 "You're back?  Even the Twain don't come back anymore."
 "Can you spare an old cutpurse a zorkmid for some grog?"
 "Fritz tried to join the other side, and now he's hell-hound chow."
 "Be careful what you steal, I hear the boss has perfected turning
 rocks into worthless pieces of glass."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "I was sure wrong about Lady Tyvefelle's house; I barely got away with my
 life and lost my lock pick in the process."
 "You're back?  Even the Twain don't come back anymore."
 "Can you spare an old cutpurse a zorkmid for some grog?"
 "Fritz tried to join the other side, and now he's hell-hound chow."
 "Be careful what you steal, I hear the boss has perfected turning
 rocks into worthless pieces of glass."

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:
 "Well, look who it is boys -- <playername> has come home.  You seem to have
 fallen behind in your dues.  I should kill you as an example to these
 other worthless cutpurses, but I have a better plan.  If you are ready
 maybe you could work off your back dues by performing a little job for
 me.  Let us just see if you are ready..."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Well, I didn't expect to see you back.  It shows that you are either stupid,
 or you are finally ready to accept my offer.  Let us hope for your sake it
 isn't stupidity that brings you back."

This message is not currently used:
 "Did you perhaps mistake me for some other Master of Thieves?  You must
 think me as stupid as your behavior.  I warn you not to try my patience."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "Well thugs, it looks like our friend has forgotten who is the boss
 around here.  Our friend seems to think that <currentranks> have been put in
 charge.  Wrong.  DEAD WRONG!"
 Your sudden shift in surroundings prevents you from hearing the end
 of the Master of Thieves' curse.

When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "In the time that you've been gone you've only been able to master the
 arts of a <currentrank>?  I've trained ten times again as many Robbers
 in that time.  Maybe I should send one of them, no?  Where would that
 leave you, <playername>?  Oh yeah, I remember, I was going to kill you!"

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "Maybe I should chain you to my perch here for a while.  Perhaps watching
 real chaotic men at work will bring some sense back to you.  I don't
 think I could stand the sight of you for that long though.  Come back
 when you can be trusted to act properly."

When finally assigned the quest:
 "Will everyone not going to retrieve the Master Key of Thievery from that
 jerk, the Master Assassin, take one step backwards.  Good choice,
 <playername>, because I was going to send you anyway.  My other thugs
 are too valuable to me.
 "Here's the deal.  I want the Master Key of Thievery, the Master Assassin
 has the Master Key of Thievery.  You are going to get the Master Key of Thievery
 and bring it back to me.  So simple an assignment even you can understand
 it."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are 'encouraged':

 "You don't seem to understand, 
 the Master Key of Thievery isn't here so neither should you be!"
 "May Kos curse you with lead fingers.  Get going!"
 "We don't have all year.  GET GOING!"
 "How would you like a scar necklace?  I'm just the jeweler to do it!"
 "Lazy S.O.B.  Maybe I should call up someone else..."
 "Maybe I should open your skull and see if my instructions are inside?"
 "This is not a task you can complete in the afterlife, you know."
 "Inside every living person is a dead person trying to get out,
 and I have your key!"
 "We're almost out of hell-hound chow, so why don't you just get moving!"
 "You know, the Master Key of Thievery isn't going to come when you
 whistle.  You must get it yourself."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 Those damn little hairs tell you that you are nearer to
 the Master Key of Thievery.

When returning:
 Not wanting to face the Master of Thieves without having stolen
 the Master Key of Thievery, you continue.

When first entering the goal level:
 You feel a great swelling up of courage, sensing the presence of
 the Master Key of Thievery.  Or is it fear?

When returning:
 The hairs on the back of your neck whisper -- it's fear.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "Ah!  You must be the Master of Thieves' ... er, `hero'.  A pleasure
 to meet you."

Upon further meetings:

 "We meet again.  Please reconsider your actions."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "Surely, <playername>, you have learned that you cannot trust any bargains
 that the Master of Thieves has made.  I can show you how to continue on
 your quest without having to run into him again."

When you have the Master Key of Thievery, but the Master Assassin is still alive:

 "Please, think for a moment about what you are doing.  Do you truly
 believe that Kos would want the Master of Thieves to have
 the Master Key of Thievery?"

====Discouragement====

The Master Assassin will occasionally utter 'maledictions':

 "May I suggest a compromise.  Are you interested in gold or gems?"
 "Please don't force me to kill you."
 "Grim times are upon us all.  Will you not see reason?"
 "I knew the Master of Thieves, and you're no Master of Thieves, thankfully."
 "It is a shame that we are not meeting under more pleasant circumstances."
 "I was once like you are now, <playername>.  Believe in me -- our way
 is better."
 "Stay with me, and I will make you the Master Key of Thievery's guardian."
 "When you return, with or without the Master Key of Thievery,
 the Master of Thieves will have you killed."
 "Do not be fooled; I am prepared to kill to defend the Master Key of Thievery."
 "I can reunite you with the Twain.  Oh, the stories you can swap."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Master Key of Thievery, the hairs on the back of your
 neck fall out.  At once you realize why the Master Assassin was
 willing to die to keep it out of the Master of Thieves' hands.  Somehow
 you know that you must do likewise.

When killing the nemesis:

 "I know what you are thinking, <playername>.  It is not too late for you
 to use the Master Key of Thievery wisely.  For the sake of your guild
 <brothers|sisters>, do what is right."
 You sit and wait for death to come for the Master Assassin, and then you
 brace yourself for your next meeting with the Master of Thieves!

When returning to your quest leader:

 "Well, I'll be damned.  You got it.  I am proud of you, a fine <currentrank>
 you've turned out to be.
 "While you were gone I got to thinking, you and the Master Key of Thievery
 together could bring me more treasure than either of you apart, so why don't
 you take it with you.  All I ask is a cut of whatever loot you come by.
 That is a better deal than I offered the Master Assassin.
 "But, you see what happened to the Master Assassin when he refused.
 Don't make me find another to send after you this time."

When subsequently throwing the Master Key of Thievery to the Master of Thieves:

 The Master of Thieves seems tempted to swap the Master Key of Thievery for
 the mundane one you detect in his pocket, but noticing your alertness,
 evidently chickens out.
 "Go filch the Amulet before someone else beats you to it.
 The Dungeons of Doom are back the way you came, through the magic portal."

===Post-quest===

When talking to the Master of Thieves after the quest:

 "Quite the little thief, aren't we, <playername>.  Can I interest you in a
 swap for the Master Key of Thievery.  Look around, anything in the keep
 is yours for the asking."

When talking to the Master of Thieves after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "I see that with your abilities, and my brains, we could rule this world.
 "All that we would need to be all-powerful is for you to take that little
 trinket you've got there up to the Astral plane.  From there, Kos will
 show you what to do with it.  Once that's done, we will be invincible!"

== Strategy ==
Several wrinkles in the level design make the Rogue Quest one of the most difficult, despite the Master Assassin's relative lack of damage:

* The home level is time-consuming to navigate, and the longer you spend on it, the greater the chance that one of the chameleons will turn into a master- or arch-[[lich]], warp to you, and cast a spell that ruins your day. You might also approach an innocuous monster in melee, only for it to turn into a [[minotaur]] or [[mind flayer]] or something equally deadly, with no way to teleport yourself away.
* About {{frac|7}} of generated monsters will be [[nymph]]s, with the corresponding hazards of losing your weapon and armor and having your wands used against you. [[Guardian naga]]s are also quite common and can inflict paralysis.
* The goal level is split into multiple sections by non-diggable walls, with no walkable path between the stairs and Nemesis. Because the goal is a [[non-teleport level]], gaining access to the Master Assassin is non-trivial.

Acquire [[magic resistance]] if possible before entering the home level, and be ready to engrave Elbereth if  a dangerous monster appears. If you have a [[ring of protection from shape changers]], keep it on until you have hunted down all the chameleons on the level. The locate and goal levels also have several chameleons, although you generally don't have to spend much time on either of them.

If possible, close and lock the guild hall doors behind you to prevent the thugs from spilling out into the streets. Having multiple peaceful monsters makes the narrow corridors even more annoying to navigate.

Use your daggers or darts to eliminate nymphs and leprechauns from a distance, and try to avoid getting surrounded on the locate level. If you have [[polymorph control]], polymorphing into a nymph or succubus will protect you from their theft attacks. [[Magic cancellation|MC3]] or a [[ring of free action]] will protect you from the nagas, if you can't prevent them from closing to melee range.{{upcoming|NetHack 3.7.0|An [[oilskin cloak]] (or [[grease]] on your cloak) is also recommended, since the guardian nagas' grab attack is now functional.}}

On the goal level, there are a number of ways of reaching the Master Assassin, in roughly decreasing order of practicality:
* Quaff a cursed [[potion of invisibility]] while standing on the stairs to awaken the Master Assassin, who will then teleport to you.
* [[Polymorph]] yourself into a [[xorn]] to [[phase]] through the walls; be sure to remove your cloak and body armor first to avoid destroying them.
* Use the psychic blast of a tame [[mind flayer]] (or polyself form) to alert the Master Assassin of your presence.
* [[Dig]] down from the previous level and hopefully land in the region where the quest nemesis is and wake him. After waking him, leave the level by [[quaff]]ing a cursed [[potion of gain level]], reading a cursed [[scroll of teleportation]] or reading the uncursed scroll while [[confusion|confused]]. You can then meet the Master Assassin at the stairs by descending them normally, and he will warp to you.
** Be prepared to do this multiple times if you land in one of the other two sections without the Nemesis. Note that [[levelport]]ing without teleport control has a chance to fail, and teleport control isn't guaranteed to work while confused.
* Apply a [[drum of earthquake]], which may wake up the Master Assassin.

The two-way magic portal back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point. Twoflower occupies the throne, where there is also a chest; there are eleven guides distributed among the five rooms within the town walls. Outside the gate are two watchmen; in the river are two piranhas, two krakens, and a giant eel; in addition to the usual undead in the marked graveyard, there are twelve giant spiders, eight forest centaurs, two random s and one random C on the level, and nine random traps.
The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls and floor.
