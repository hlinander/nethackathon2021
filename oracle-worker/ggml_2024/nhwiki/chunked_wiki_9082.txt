 "This is terrible, <playername>.  You have deviated from the true path!
 You know that <deity> requires the most strident devotion of this
 order.  The <brother|sister>hood must stand for utmost piety.
 "Go from here, atone for your sins against <deity>.  Return only when
 you have purified yourself."

When finally assigned the quest:

 "Yes, <playername>.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
 tell you of what has transpired:
 "Recently, Count Dracula and a legion of undead invaded the Temple of Light.  
 Many exterminators were killed, and the Stake of Van Helsing was stolen from us!
 Now, there are barely enough exterminators left to keep 
 the undead at bay.
 "We need you to find the Crypt of Dracula, then, from there, travel
 to Count Dracula's lair.  If you can manage to defeat Count Dracula
 and return the Stake of Van Helsing here, we can then drive off the 
 legions of undead that befoul the land.
 "Go with <deity> as your guide, <playername>."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "You can prevail, if you rely on <deity>."
 "Remember that Count Dracula has great magic at his command."
 "Be pure, my <son|daughter>."
 "Beware, the Crypt of Dracula is surrounded by a great graveyard."
 "Remember, no mercy for the evil!"
 "Acquire and wield the Stake of Van Helsing if you can.  It will aid you
 against Count Dracula."
 "Call upon <deity> when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
 "The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
 "Do not lose faith, <playername>.  If you do so, Count Dracula will grow stronger."
 "Wear the Stake of Van Helsing.  It will assist you against the undead."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:
 You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
 that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
 undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.
 You remember the descriptions of the Crypt of Dracula, given to you by
 Van Helsing.  It is ahead that you will find Count Dracula's trail.

When returning:
 Again, you stand before the Crypt of Dracula.

When first entering the goal level:
 The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
 of tortured souls assault your psyche.
 Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...

When returning:
 Again, you have invaded Count Dracula's domain.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "Ah, so Van Helsing has sent another exterminator to retrieve
 the Stake of Van Helsing.
 "No, I see you are no exterminator.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
 after all.  Prepare to die, <currentrank>!  You shall never regain
 the Stake of Van Helsing!

Upon further meetings:

 "So, <currentrank>.  Again you challenge me."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "Die now, <currentrank>.  <deity> has no power here to aid you."

When you have the Stake of Van Helsing, but Count Dracula is still alive:

 "You shall die, <currentrank>, and I will have the Stake of Van Helsing back."

====Discouragement====

Count Dracula will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "Submit to my will, Undead Slayer, and I shall spare you."
 "Your puny powers are no match for me, Undead Slayer."
 "I shall have you turned into a zombie for my pleasure!"
 "Despair now, <currentrank>.  <deity> cannot help you."
 "I shall feast upon your soul for many days, Undead Slayer."
 "Your death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!"
 "You cannot defeat Count Dracula, you fool.  I shall kill you now."
 "Your precious Van Helsing will be my next victim."
 "I feel your powers failing you, <currentrank>.  You shall die now."
 "With the Stake of Van Helsing, nothing can stand in my way."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Stake of Van Helsing, you feel the essence of
 <deity> fill your soul.  You know now why Count Dracula stole it from
 the Temple of Light, for with it, an Undead Slayer of <deity> could
 easily defeat his plans.
 You sense a message from <deity>.  Though not verbal, you
 get the impression that you must return to Van Helsing as soon
 as possible.

When killing the nemesis:
 You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as Count Dracula's body dissolves
 into a cloud of noxious gas.
 Suddenly, a voice booms out:
     Mark my words, niggling! I shall return!
 You then hear the voice of Count Dracula, laughing insanely...

When returning to your quest leader:
 "You have returned, <playername>.  And with the Stake of Van Helsing, I see.
 Congratulations.
 "I have been in meditation, and have received direction from
 a minion of <deity>.  <deity> commands that you retain
 the Stake of Van Helsing.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
 of Yendor.
 "Go forth, and let <deity> guide your steps."

When subsequently throwing the Stake of Van Helsing to Van Helsing:
 Van Helsing reiterates that the Stake of Van Helsing is yours now.
 "The time has come to resume your search for the Amulet.
 The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the magic portal
 that brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to Van Helsing after the quest:
 "Welcome back, <playername>.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"

When talking to Van Helsing after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "You have prevailed, <playername>!  <deity> is surely with you.  Now,
 you must take the amulet, and sacrifice it on <deity>'s altar on
 the Astral plane.  I suspect that I shall never see you again in this
 life, but I hope to at <deity>'s feet."

The two-way magic portal back to the [[Dungeons of Doom]] is at the marked point. The [[Norn]] occupies the building, with a [[chest]] next to her; there are eight [[warrior]]s in the Shrine with her. Distributed in the marked spots are ten fire ants, with two fire giants towards the left side (one of them stands on the downstair and is not marked); there are also six [[fire trap]]s randomly placed. The entire level is [[no-teleport]] and has undiggable walls and floor. Note that if a fire trap occurs on an ice square, triggering it will melt the ice, dumping you (or a luckless monster) into the water.

The pools of water and lava will not be in the exact spots shown; they are placed randomly. Occasionally, when the level generator traces a line of solid floor for the hero to walk on, this line will cut through one or more pools, leading to some odd shape.

===Upper filler level===
This is an ice-plain level, with five [[fire ant]]s, a [[fire giant]], and one random {{monclasssym|a}}; nine random objects; and seven random [[trap]]s.

The above core of the level is surrounded by empty ice plain, with the upstair off to the lower right; note that the only entrance to the cavern is at the left side. Randomly placed around the mapped area are seventeen [[fire ant]]s, seven [[fire giant]]s, two random {{monclasssym|H}} and one random {{monclasssym|a}}; fifteen random objects; four fire traps, and two other random traps. The level has undiggable walls and floor. Teleportation is permitted.

===Lower filler level(s)===

The above core of the level is surrounded by empty lava plain. [[Lord Surtur]], with the [[Bell of Opening]] and the [[Orb of Fate]], is at the center of the level; also in the mapped area are twelve [[fire giant]]s (ten of which are in the marked locations), one random {{monclasssym|H}}, four [[fire ant]]s and two random {{monclasssym|a}}; 14 random objects; four [[fire trap]]s, three [[squeaky board]]s (two marked and one randomly placed), and two more random [[trap]]s.  The drawbridges sometimes start raised: the northern one half the time, and the southern one, independently, one eighth of the time.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 You materialize at the base of a snowy hill.  Atop the hill sits
 a place you know well, the Shrine of Destiny.  You immediately realize
 that something here is very wrong!
 In places, the snow and ice have been melted into steaming pools of
 water.  Fumaroles and pools of bubbling lava surround the hill.
 The stench of sulphur is carried through the air, and you <see|sense> creatures
 that should not be able to live in this environment moving towards you.

Next time:
 Once again, you are near the abode of the Norn.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again you materialize near the Norn's abode.  You have a nagging feeling
 that this may be the last time you come here.

===Quest guardians===
If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Hail, and well met, brave Valkyrie."
 "May <Tyr|Odin> guide your steps, <playername>."
 "The Norn weakens.  Without the Orb of Fate, her foresight is dim."
 "You must hurry, <playername>, else Ragnarok may well come."
 "I would deal with this foul Lord Surtur myself, but the Norn forbids it."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Hail, and well met, brave Valkyrie."
 "May <Tyr|Odin> guide your steps, <playername>."
 "The Norn told us you had succeeded!"
 "You recovered the Orb of Fate just in time, <playername>."
 "Hail <Tyr|Odin>, for delivering the Orb of Fate back to us."

===Quest leader===
When you first meet your quest leader:
 "Ah, <playername>, my daughter.  You have returned to the Shrine of Destiny
 at last.  We are in dire need of your aid, but I must determine if you
 are yet ready for such an undertaking.
 "Let me read your fate..."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:
 "Let me read the future for you now, <playername>, perhaps you have managed to
 change it enough..."

This message is not currently used:
 "Again, I shall read your fate, my daughter.  Let us both hope that you have
 made changes to become ready for this task..."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:
 "No, <playername>.  Your fate is sealed.  I must cast about for another
 champion.  Begone from my presence, and never return.  Know this, that
 you shall never succeed in this life, and Valhalla is denied to you."

When being rejected due to lack of experience:
 "I see you and Lord Surtur fighting, <playername>.  But you are not prepared and
 shall die at Lord Surtur's hand if you proceed.  No.  This will not do.
 Go back out into the world, and grow more experienced at the ways of
 war.  Only when you have returned a Warrior will you be able to defeat
 Lord Surtur."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:
 "NO!  This is terrible.  I see you becoming an ally of Lord Surtur, and
 leading his armies in the final great battles.  This must not come to
 pass!  You have strayed from the <lawful|neutral> path.  You must purge yourself,
 and return here only when you have regained a state of purity."

When finally assigned the quest:
 "It is not clear, <playername>, for my sight is limited without
 the Orb of Fate.  But it is now likely that you can defeat Lord Surtur,
 and recover the Orb of Fate.
 "A short time ago, Lord Surtur and his minions attacked this place.  They
 opened the huge volcanic vents you <see|sense> about the hill, and attacked.
 I knew that this was to come to pass, and had asked <Tyr|Odin> for a group
 of warriors to help defend this place.  The few you <see|sense> here are the
 mightiest of Valhalla's own, and are all that are left of one hundred
 <Tyr|Odin> sent.
 "Despite the great and glorious battle we fought, Lord Surtur managed at last
 to steal the Orb of Fate.  This has upset the balance of the universe, and
 unless the Orb of Fate is returned into my care, Lord Surtur may start Ragnarok.
 "You must find the entrance to the cave of Surtur.  Travel downward
 from there and you will find Lord Surtur's lair.  Defeat him and
 return the Orb of Fate to me."

====Encouragement====
If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:
 "Go with the blessings of <Tyr|Odin>."
 "Call upon <Tyr|Odin> when you are in need."
 "Use the Orb of Fate if you can.  It will protect you."
 "Magical cold is very effective against Lord Surtur."
 "To face Lord Surtur, you will need to be immune to fire."
 "May <Tyr|Odin> strengthen your sword-arm."
 "It becomes more likely that Ragnarok will come with every passing moment.
 You must hurry, <playername>."
 "If Lord Surtur can master the Orb of Fate, he will be powerful enough to
 face <Tyr|Odin> far earlier than is fated.  This must not be!"
 "Remember your training, <playername>.  You can succeed."

===Locate and goal levels===
When first entering the locate level:
 The ice and snow gives way to a valley floor.  You <see|sense> ahead of you
 a huge round hill surrounded by pools of lava.  This then is the entrance
 to the cave of Surtur.  It looks like you're not going to get in without
 a fight though.

When returning:
 Once again, you stand before the entrance to the cave of Surtur.

When first entering the goal level:
 Through clouds of sulphurous gasses, you <see|sense> a rock palisade
 surrounded with a moat of bubbling lava.  You remember the description
 from something that the Norn said.  This is the lair of Lord Surtur.

When returning:
 Once again, you stand in sight of Lord Surtur's lair.

===Quest nemesis===
When first encountering the quest nemesis:
 "So!  The Norn has finally sent a Valkyrie to challenge me!
 "I thought that mastering the Orb of Fate would enable me to challenge <Tyr|Odin>,
 but it has shown me that first I must kill you!
 So come, little sister.  Once I defeat you, I can at last begin
 the final battle with <Tyr|Odin>."

Upon further meetings:
 "Again you challenge me, <currentrank>.  Good.  I will kill you now."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:
 "Have you not learned yet?  You cannot defeat Lord Surtur!"

When you have the Orb of Fate, but Lord Surtur is still alive:
 "I will kill you, Valkyrie, and wrest the Orb of Fate from your mangled hands."

====Discouragement====
Lord Surtur will occasionally utter maledictions:
 "I am your death, Valkyrie."
 "You cannot prevail, <currentrank>.  I have foreseen your every move."
 "With you out of the way, Valhalla will be mine for the taking."
 "I killed scores of <Tyr|Odin>'s best when I took the Orb of Fate.
 "Do you really think that one Valkyrie can stand against me?"
 "Who bears the souls of Valkyries to Valhalla, <currentrank>?"
 "No, <Tyr|Odin> cannot help you here."
 "Some instrument of <Tyr|Odin> you are, <playername>.  You are a weakling!"
 "Never have I seen a Valkyrie so clumsy in battle."
 "You die now, little sister."
 "Your body I destroy now, your soul when my hordes overrun Valhalla!"

===Victory===
When picking up your quest artifact:
 As you pick up the Orb of Fate, your mind is suddenly filled with images,
 and you perceive all of the possibilities of each potential choice you
 could make.  As you begin to control and channel your thoughts, you
 realize that you must return the Orb of Fate to The Norn immediately.

When killing the nemesis:
 A look of surprise and horror appears on Lord Surtur's face.
     No!!!  The Orb of Fate has lied to me!  I have been misled!
 Suddenly, Lord Surtur grasps his head and screams in agony, then dies.

When returning to your quest leader:
 As you approach, The Norn rises and touches the Orb of Fate.
 "You may take the Orb of Fate with you, <playername>.  I have removed from
 it the power to foretell the future, for that power no mortal should
 have.  Its other abilities, however, you have at your disposal.
 "You must now begin in <Tyr|Odin>'s name to search for the Amulet of Yendor.
 May your steps be guided by <Tyr|Odin>, my daughter."

When subsequently throwing the Orb of Fate to the Norn:
 "Careful, <playername>!  The Orb of Fate might break, and that would be
 a tragic loss.  You are its keeper now, and the time has come to
 resume your search for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your
 return through the magic portal that brought you here."

===Post-quest===
When talking to the Norn after the quest:
 "Greetings, <playername>.  I have not been able to pay as much attention to
 your search for the Amulet as I have wished.  How do you fare?"

When talking to the Norn after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:
 "Excellent, <playername>.  I see you have recovered the Amulet!
 "You must take the Amulet to the Great Temple of <Tyr|Odin>, on the Astral
 plane.  There you must offer the Amulet to <Tyr|Odin>.
 "Go now, my daughter.  I cannot tell you your fate, as the power of the
 Amulet interferes with mine.  I hope for your success."

== Strategy ==
In general, the Valkyrie quest is one of the harder quests. Do be careful of the [[Titans]]. [[Quest#Quest_difficulty_statistics|Only 75% of Valkyrie quests are completed]], making it the third hardest quest by role. However, the nemesis, [[Lord Surtur]], is not particularly dangerous. In fact, some would say the [[lava]] and [[drawbridge]]s are the real quest nemeses: as of this writing, deaths to "dissolved in molten lava", "crushed to death by a collapsing drawbridge", "burned by molten lava", and "crushed to death by an exploding drawbridge" in the Valkyrie quest level combined had claimed 5.6 times more lives on [[NAO]] than Lord Surtur (a total of 420 versus 75).

[[Excalibur]] or [[Mjollnir]] and a somewhat negative [[armor class]] should be plenty to kill Surtur easily. As for the drawbridges, you can avoid the risk of getting blown up by waking Lord Surtur up without crossing them. If you can clear out some of the fire giants, a [[wand of striking]] or [[wand of magic missile|magic missile]] will wake him up (don't stand on the drawbridge if using striking, of course); alternatively, sometimes just hanging out in his line of sight and fighting some monsters will work as well.

The only other thing you really want is [[fire resistance]]; this will prevent you from dying instantly if you do step into lava, prevent the loss of HP from stepping on a fire trap, and prevent damage from being hit by fiery monsters. The [[fire ant]]s and [[fire giant]]s on the first level should allow you to gain fire resistance if you don't already have it.

The quest artifact is [[the Orb of Fate]], one of the better artifacts. When combined with the difficulty of the quest in general, the value of the quest artifact means that whether or not this quest is completed early or late is left to the player's discretion.

If you have a tinning kit, it is a good idea to kill and tin all the giants you can for the [[strength]] increase.

=== Lava ===
{{main|Lava}}
To avoid dissolving in lava, it is best to bring a [[ring of levitation]] (or levitation boots or ''fireproof'' [[water walking boots]]) along and wear them when on any of the levels containing lava (removing them only to pick up objects and go down levels in the case of levitation). It's not a bad idea to wear levitation or water walking on the ice levels as well, as a fire trap could potentially melt the ice and plunge you into the water. If you don't have levitation, however, you can probably still do the quest; you'll just have to step carefully. (Occasionally you will find that the staircase on the goal level is completely surrounded by lava, in which case you'll have to turn around if you don't have levitation.)

If you do fall into lava, provided you have fire resistance, you can still save yourself by [[zap]]ping a [[wand of cold]] down ({{kbd|>}}) to freeze the lava and then moving out. Keep in mind that trying to walk out may take a long time; [[teleportation]], if available, is usually a better idea. However, most monsters on the Valkyrie quest respect [[Elbereth]]. Digging yourself out is safe only if there are no other adjacent lava squares.

The two-way magic portal back to the Dungeons of Doom is at the marked point at the bottom right. The High Ice Mage is at the center of the circle, along with five frosters and a chest In addition, there are also two other peaceful frosters, two peaceful white dragons, and a peaceful baby white dragon, presumably the child of the other two. The circle is besieged by five earth elementals and four xorn; there are also six randomly-placed falling rock traps and two randomly-placed magic traps.
The entire level is no-teleport and has undiggable walls and floor.

The above core of the level is surrounded by empty ground. The Earth Mage, with the Bell of Opening and the Storm Whistle, is at the marked unaligned altar. Randomly placed on the level are eight earth elementals and five xorn; seven random objects; four falling rock traps, and two random traps. The walls of the Lair are undiggable; teleportation is permitted.

==Messages==
===Entry===
First time:
 The howling arctic wind is like a welcome home for you.
 Off in the distance, you can see the familiar ice crags that surround
 the great Ring of Ice.
 Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
 evil magic in the air.


Next time:
 Once again, you near the great Ring of Ice.  You know that the High Ice Mage
 will be waiting.

If already rejected twice due to bad alignment:
 Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
 the great Ring of Ice.

===Quest guardians===

If #chatting before the quest is complete:
 "Our enemies come from beneath the earth itself!"
 "Remember to pack a pick-axe!"
 "There has been little studying accomplished since the horde arrived."
 "The horde is mighty in numbers, but they have little courage."
 "The High Ice Mage has helped defend us, but our strength is fading."

If #chatting after the quest is complete:
 "Remember to pack a pick-axe!"
 "Since the defeat of the hoarde, all can concentrate fully on our studies!"
 "The frozen lake looks beautiful today"
 "I always knew the Earth Mage was too warm blooded to defeat us!"
 "I've been trying to alter cone of cold from Vanilla to Chocolate - yum!"

===Quest leader===

When you first meet your quest leader:

 "Ah, <playername>.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
 need of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.
 "But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."

When you return, having been rejected due to lack of experience:

 "<playername>, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"

This message is not currently used:

 "Again, you stand before me, <playername>.  Surely you have prepared yourself."

When you are expelled from the quest for having failed the alignment test
seven times:

 "Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, <player>.  You will never attain
 the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
 closed this future to you.
 "I will protect these people as best I can, but soon the Earth Mage will overcome
 me and destroy all who once called you <brother|sister>.  Now begone!"

When being rejected due to lack of experience:

 "<playername>, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
 the Earth Mage.  Only a Permafroster with the help of <deity> could ever hope to
 defeat him."

When being rejected due to having worse than pious alignment:

 "<playername>!  You have wandered from the path of the <alignment>!
 If you attempt to overcome the Earth Mage in this state, he will surely
 enslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
 Go forth, and return when you feel ready."

When finally assigned the quest:

 "The world is in great need of your assistance, <playername>.
 "About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
 as the Earth Mage, had begun to summon a large group of elementals and monsters.
 "The Earth Mage and his horde swept down upon the great Ring of Ice and stole 
 the Storm Whistle. He seeks to bend it to his will. After we regrouped, I
 sent forth a summons for you.
 "If the Earth Mage can bend the Storm Whistle to his will, he will become
 almost indestructible.  He will then be able to summon our elementals
 to him.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
 and with <deity> behind you, you alone can defeat the Earth Mage.
 "You must go to the Earth Mage's Cave.  From there, you can track down
 the Earth Mage, defeat him, and return the Storm Whistle to us.  Only
 then will the world be safe."

====Encouragement====

If you subsequently chat to your quest leader, you are encouraged:

 "The Earth Mage is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
 "Remember that the Earth Mage is a great sorcerer.  He has lived for a thousand years."
 "If you fail, <playername>, I will not be able to protect these people long."
 "To enter the Earth Mage's Cave, you must be very stealthy.  The horde will be on guard."
 "Call upon <deity> in your time of need."
 "May <deity> protect you, and guide your steps."
 "If you can lay hands upon the Storm Whistle, carry it for good fortune."
 "I cannot stand against the Earth Mage's sorcery.  But <deity> will help you."
 "Do not fear the Earth Mage. I know you can defeat him."
 "You have a great road to travel, <playername>, but only after you defeat
 the Earth Mage."

===Locate and goal levels===

When first entering the locate level:

 The air is heavy and claustrophobic.  You know that you have located the Earth Mage's Cave.

When returning:

 Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate the Earth Mage's Cave.

When first entering the goal level:

 The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
 very air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
 make you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of the Earth Mage.

When returning:

 Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.

===Quest nemesis===

When first encountering the quest nemesis:

 "So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer the High Ice Mage sends to do his bidding.
 I have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.
 "Prepare to die, Ice Mage."

Upon further meetings:

 "I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."

And on the 4th and subsequent meetings:

 "You return yet again, Ice Mage!  Are you prepared for death now?"

When you have the Storm Whistle, but the Earth Mage is still alive:

 "I shall have the Storm Whistle back, you pitiful excuse for an 
 Ice Mage.
 And your life as well."

====Discouragement====

The Earth Mage will occasionally utter maledictions:

 "My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
 "You are a sorry excuse for a <currentrank>."
 "Run while you can, Ice Mage.  My next spell will be your last."
 "I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
 "<deity> cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
 "Your <alignment> nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
 "Come, Ice Mage.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your people."
 "Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off the High Ice Mage, and your people."
 "Fight, Ice Mage, or are you afraid of the mighty Earth Mage?"
 "You have failed, Ice Mage.  Now, my victory is complete."

===Victory===

When picking up your quest artifact:

 As you pick up the Storm Whistle, you feel the power of it
 flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
 at once, even though you are holding it.

When killing the nemesis:

 The Earth Mage falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then his
 body fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
 slowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
 begun to fade.

When returning to your quest leader:

 When the High Ice Mage sees the Storm Whistle, he smiles, and says:
     Well done, <playername>.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
     What, now, should be done with the Storm Whistle?
     Our people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
     other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as the Earth Mage did.
     Take the Storm Whistle with you, <playername>.  It will guard you in
     your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
     quest far greater than you realize.
     Remember me, <playername>, and return when you have triumphed.  I
     will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
     time comes.

When subsequently throwing the Storm Whistle to the High Ice Mage:

 The High Ice Mage handles the Storm Whistle for a moment, then looks at you.
 "You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
 for the Amulet.  The Dungeons of Doom await your return through the
 magic portal which brought you here."

===Post-quest===

When talking to the High Ice Mage after the quest:

 "Tell us, <playername>, have you fared well on your great quest?"

When talking to the High Ice Mage after getting the [[Amulet of Yendor|Amulet]]:

 "This is wondrous, <playername>.  I feared that you could not possibly
 succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
 of Yendor!
 "I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
 the Book of Skelos, I found this:
     <deity> will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
     be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for <deity> has willed it so.
     It is said that the child of <deity> will recover the Amulet of Yendor
     that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.
 "As you now possess the amulet, <playername>, I suspect that the Book
 speaks of you.
     The child of <deity> will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
     Plane, where the Great Temple of <deity> is to be found.  The Amulet
     will be sacrificed to <deity>, there on His altar.  Then the child will
     stand by <deity> as champion of all Ice Mages for eternity.
 "This is all I know, <playername>.  I hope it will help you."
