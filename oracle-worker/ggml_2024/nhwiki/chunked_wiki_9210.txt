&&%s&& %s SlashTHEM traps {147057 2022-07-30T05:22:06Z {4001600 Shadow Rider} shit trap was removed {{stub}}
[[SlashTHEM]] new traps. (just started, probably many errors).

Many traps that do damage will do more damage to the player if they're generated deep in the dungeon, which means arrow traps and suchlike are no longer meaningless to high-level, high-HP characters. Also, some traps can randomly disappear if players or monsters trigger them repeatedly.

{{White|^}} Web traps display with the "^" glyph to avoid confusion with amulets.

{{Brown|^}} spear trap (from [[Sporkhack]]), doing rnd(10)+ rnd(level_difficulty() + 1) points of damage to the player. A player polymorphed into a [[thick-skinned]] monster removes the trap without taking damage, and a [[levitation|levitating]] character or one polymorphed into an [[unsolid]] monster doesn't take damage either.

{{Gray|^}} ceiling collapse trap (from [[Sporkhack]]), which can be triggered by the player only and also triggers only once, dropping a shower of rocks and boulders on the player. Up to 200 rocks/boulders are generated, each of which adds to the damage taken (2% chance for each to be a boulder instead of a rock), and the ones landing on the player's square do 0-1 points of damage (+2d4 if a boulder). If the player is wearing a hard helmet, the damage is divided by 2; however, rnd((level_difficulty()*2) + 1) points of damage are added to the final damage done to the player. This means a player character who is low on hit points already may be killed instantly by walking into this trap.

{{Brightcyan|^}} ice trap (from [[Unnethack]]), doing d(4, 4) + rnd((level_difficulty() / 3) + 1) points of damage (less if [[Cold_resistance|cold resistant]]) to a player walking into it, with a 10% chance of the player being frozen for (5 * damage taken from the trap) turns and a 1 in 33 chance of shattering potions in the player's open inventory.

{{Yellow|^}} magic beam trap (from [[Sporkhack]]), which fires a random beam at the player or monster triggering it. Possible beam types are magic missile, sleep ray, lightning bolt, fire bolt, cold bolt, poison gas, acid ray, solar beam, or death ray/disintegration blast. There is a 5% chance for the trap to disappear if a player triggered it, and a 14.3% chance for it to disappear if a monster triggered it.

{{Brightblue|^}} rust trap, rusts some items when the player triggers it
