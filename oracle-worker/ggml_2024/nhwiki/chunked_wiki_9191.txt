{{encyclopedia|
It shouldn't be any surprise that there are eladrins who devote themselves to art, music, and magic. The firres (pronounced feers) are creatures who live for beauty; their lives are consumed by a fiery passion for art of any kind, and they strive to make their own existence a living image of wonder and delight.

The firre eladrins live as wandering minstrels and bards in Arborea, attending the courts of more powerful eladrins or tarrying to entertain a circle of coures in a forgotten dell. Their pursuit of beauty leads them to any place where art, skill, or grace is held in high esteem. A body could run across a firre traveling the Outlands or visiting the palaces of neutral-aligned powers just as easily as he'd find one in Arborea. Firres have a deep love and appreciation of mortal art, and often embark on lengthy sojourns on the Prime Material Plane to seek out works of excellence.

In their demihuman, firre eladrins resemble stocky elves with brilliant red hair and fiery red eyes. At first glance, a firre might be taken for a half-elf, but her eyes give her away; they have no iris or pupil, and glow brightly with the firre's inner flame. Firres can also transform themselves into man-size pillars or balls of fire.

The shiere knights are the second most dangerous eladrin type in the Tower, as they have powerful crystal equipment. 

{{encyclopedia|
The warriors of Arborea are the shieres, graceful eladrin  knights who fight with skill, strength, and honor. They're the defenders of the eladrin courts, a shining host that seeks out evil intruders and ensures that no darkness will trouble the Queen of Stars or her people. By night the shieres gather together in bright companies to ride the wilds of Olympus and drive away any who would do the folk of Arborea harm.

The shieres appear to be exceptionally tall high elves of some kind. They're long-limbed and slender, with lanky frames and long, narrow faces and hands. A shiere's as strong as the mightiest mortal warrior despite his slender build. All shieres are very fair-skinned, with pale golden or silver hair and piercing eyes of blue, green, or violet.

Unlike the other eladrins, shieres're bound more permanently into their demihuman form and can change shape only into a harmless ball of faerie-light, similar to that of a coure eladrin.

{{encyclopedia|
The ghaeles are the knights errant of the eladrins. Wherever evil and tyranny raise their ugly heads, the ghaeles respond. Working behind the scenes, they quietly muster resistance and offer guidance to any creatures of good heart with the courage to stand against their oppressors. More than any other eladrins, the ghaeles are accustomed to working from behind the veil.

Ghaeles resemble tall, athletic high elves. They might easily be taken noble elves if not for their pearly, opalescent eyes and radiant aura. Of course, a ghaele may be wearing any manner of mortal guise when encountered away from Arborea. Ghaele eladrins can also take the form of an incorporeal cloud of luminous energy.

'''Tulani''' are one of the most dangerous Eladrin types.  They have powerful equipment, and cast 9d6-damage random element spells (chosen from fire, cold, and shock).

Tulani make good pets, as they are human sized and start with good equipment.  They are not generated with a weapon of any kind, so you may need to give them a mattock or two-handed sword.  One high-caste Eladrin is always generated on the [[Plane of Water]].  

In 50% of games, '''Gae Eladrin''' will be the most powerful Eldadrin caste, and Tulani will not spawn naturally.

{{encyclopedia|
The greatest of the eladrins are the tulani, or faerie lords. Their courts are scattered throughout Olympus, never staying in the same place more than one night. The tulani are peaceful in nature and take up arms only when Arborea itself is threatened or the direst of emergencies requires their attention.

Tulani're creatures of unearthly beauty and grace; their voices are living music, and their faces shine so brightly that mortals find it difficult to look at them. In form they're tall, stately elven lords dressed in shimmering robes of shifting color. A tulani is surrounded by a magical aura that evil creatures cannot bear to be near. Tulani eladrins can also take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5' in diameter.

Visitors to Arborea who seek out the tulani courts soon find out that the eladrins aren't easy to find when they want to avoid someone. When a cutter finally gets to meet with a tulani, he's wise to keep his bone-box shut and mind his manners. The tulani don't tolerate insolence or disrespect from mortals, but are gracious hosts when their guests behave themselves.

The eladrins are the native race of Arborea, just as the devils are associated with the Nine Hells and the demons with the Abyss. They're wild and free beings who exult in their own existence and live a life of song and celebration. The eladrins aid all people of good hearts against the forces of evil, but seek to do so with individual acts of kindness or heroism.

The '''manticore''' is a [[feline]] in [[dNetHack]] with multiple melee attacks, a [[poison]]ous sting, and a [[Paralysis|paralyzing]] ranged attack. Without free action or some other means of resistance, the manticore's ranged paralysis attack is not to be taken lightly, as a player could be quickly incapacitated and killed.

{{encyclopedia|
The manticore is a true monster, with a leonine torso and legs,
batlike wings, a man's head, a tail tipped with iron spikes, and
an appetite for human flesh.

The manticore stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 15
feet in length. It has a 25-foot wingspan. Each section of the 
manticore closely resembles the creature it imitates. The leonine 
torso has a tawny hide, the mane is a lion's brown-black color,
and the batlike wings are a dark brown with sparse hair. All 
manticores have heads that resemble human males; the mane
resembles a heavy beard and long hair.

In combat, the manticore fires volleys of 1-6 tail spikes.
The spikes are coated in a paralyzing venom.

Their shadow-based attacks ignore most forms of [[AC]], meaning that they hit often and for high damage each time.  Their ranged attack is also more dangerous than that of other monsters, as the shadow bolts appear in your square and therefore will never be blocked by another monster that happens to be in the edderkop's line of fire.  Additionally, the shadow bolts leave behind a [[web]] trap in your square, potentially leaving you trapped.  As they are capable of firing a bolt every turn, they will cheerfully sit back out of your reach and blast you to death with shadow bolts.

Edderkops, as the servants of the Black Web Entity, will fight with any [[drow]] they encounter.  Edderkops tend to be able to defeat drow in these conflicts.

Edderkops are not related to [[Keystone Kop]]s, which [[Keter Sephiroth|do not appear in dNetHack]]. The name is derived from the archaic English word attercop, meaning spider.

== Strategy ==

* Use powerful [[ranged attack]]s. It is best to kill edderkops from a distance, as their high damage melee attack is not mitigated by negative AC.
* Wield [[Sting]]. Sting can be used to cut the [[web]]bing left by the shadow bolts, restoring your freedom of movement.
* Read a [[scroll of earth]]. In a pinch, this scroll can be used to break line-of-sight from an Edderkop stun-locking you with shadow bolts.

'''Lamashtu''', the Demon Queen, appears in [[dNetHack]] as a possible Brine Flats demon lord. She is very fast and gets multiple attacks per turn. Her melee attacks consist of a level-draining bite, a touch attack capable of teleporting pieces of armor off your body to a random location on the level, and a touch attack capable of teleporting you to a random location on the level. Of these, only the last is affected my [[magic cancellation]]. Lamashtu can inflict a wide variety of harmful effects including [[disease]], [[hallucination]], [[stun]], [[slippery fingers]], as well as [[Curse items|cursing inventory items]], [[Destroy armor (monster spell)|destroying your armor]], and [[punishment|punshing you]]. She is vulnerable to silver and holy like almost all demons.

Lamashtu casts summon angel, summon devil, summon alien, nightmare, filth, curse items, death touch, and evil eye with equal probability each. 
* Summon angel, devil, and alien are self explanatory. The most dangerous one is summon alien, which can summon nasties like uvuudaums.
* Nightmare does damage based on Lamashtu's level, confuses you, stuns you, and makes you hallucinate. 
* Filth summons a deluge of filth to rain on you, which makes you sick, greases your hands, blinds you, and makes you vomit. Sickness resistance will block the illness but none of the other effects.
* Curse items and death touch will function like normal.
* Evil eye drains your luck like any other luck draining attack. 

Lamashtu does not fully respect any [[Ward (dNetHack)|ward]]. She will respect the following wards {{frac|3}} of the time: Fully reinforced (seven-lobed) [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Elder Elemental Eye|elder elemental eye]], [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Pentagram|Pentagram]], [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Hexagram|Hexagram]], and [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Heptagram|Heptagram]]. She will also respect a [[scroll of scare monster]] {{frac|3}} of the time. She will respect a [[User:Chris/dNetHack/Gorgoneion|Gorgoneion]] ward {{frac|2|3}} of the time, though the base success rate of a Gorgoneion ward depends on the reinforcement (reaching 99% at 3 levels of reinforcement&mdash;a trio of Gorgoneia). 

==Strategy==

Here is a [https://nethack.xd.cm/userdata/Tariru/dnethack/ttyrec/2015-05-02.23%3A11%3A10.ttyrec.bz2 ttyrec example] in which Lamashtu is taken down.

Some tactical suggestions on how to deal with Lamashtu:

First: Don't. In the majority of games, you have ''some'' other option other than actually fighting Lamashtu with the intent to kill her. Out of sight, out of mind. If you have controlled self-polymorph, you can bypass her lair itself both on the way down and on the ascension run. Just phase through the stone along the bottom rows of the map, you shouldn't need to enter the castle at all. If that's not an option, levelporting down and a cursed gain level up for the ascension run will also work to bypass her level. It cannot be stressed enough, avoidance is the best policy.
